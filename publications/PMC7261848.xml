                <p>A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or <italic>cw15</italic> mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Microalgae grow by converting light, water, and CO<sub>2</sub> into biomass. Algae have long been proposed for space life support systems to recycle CO<sub>2</sub> and provide food either directly or indirectly to astronauts (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brechignac and Schiller, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Niederwieser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Matula and Nabity, 2019</xref>). Many species of microalgae are photosynthetically efficient under the limiting light and low volume conditions necessary in space production (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kliphuis et al., 2012</xref>). As single cell organisms, microalgae are easy to cultivate with minimal requirements, and have great potential to yield value-added products.</p>
              <p>Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species, such as <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> and <italic>Arthrospira platensis</italic>, respectively, are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Caporgno and Mathys, 2018</xref>). Algae have nutritional benefits with high levels of antioxidants and protein with essential amino acids (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Buono et al., 2014</xref>). Algae are also rich in ω-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Salem and Eggersdorfer, 2015</xref>). The red algal carotenoid, astaxanthin, has multiple uses including the ability to protect against retinal damage in animals (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Katagiri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). Algal oils may be used in future astronaut diets to help mitigate harmful effects of microgravity and cosmic radiation during spaceflight. <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is a model organism for unicellular algae with a well-annotated genome sequence (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Merchant et al., 2007</xref>). Although Chlamydomonas is not designated as a GRAS organism, feeding studies show no harmful effects of including significant amounts of algae biomass in animal feed (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Murbach et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, Chlamydomonas can be used as a model for other microalgae species, an animal feed for space food systems, or a feedstock for manufacturing.</p>
              <p>A few past studies exposed or grew algal species in space conditions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Giardi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Niederwieser et al., 2018</xref>). A Space Shuttle mission in 1985 used <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to examine phototaxic responses in microgravity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mergenhagen and Mergenhagen, 1989</xref>). Microgravity allowed cells to remain close to light sources in spaceflight suggesting that photosynthetic productivity could be higher in space. By contrast, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2006)</xref> grew cyanobacteria for 15 days in a satellite and found reduced growth relative to a ground control. However, the ground control temperature and light cycles were not adjusted to the space conditions. The satellite had two temperature drops and two missed day photoperiods preventing strong conclusions from being drawn about growth rates. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Giardi et al. (2013)</xref> compared Chlamydomonas photosynthetic responses for wild-type and photosystem II (PSII) D1 mutants in stationary cultures. Spaceflight had a greater negative effect on PSII fluorescence in wild-type cells and negatively impacted cell growth upon return to Earth. Soviet and Russian spaceflight experiments indicate that <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> has similar growth kinetics in space and on Earth, but the cells experience spaceflight as a stress (reviewed in <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Niederwieser et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>The impact of the spaceflight environment for larger scale production of algae is currently unknown. To test larger scale microalgae production, the European Space Agency (ESA) has developed a photobioreactor that pumps liquid media through a meandering path, pipe-reactor (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bretschneider et al., 2016</xref>). Gas exchange is mediated by fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membranes that allow CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, while algae are continuously mixed with a peristaltic pump (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Helisch et al., 2019</xref>). This photobioreactor is currently being tested on the International Space Station (ISS) for long-term growth of <italic>C. vulgaris.</italic> A significant challenge of maintaining photosynthetic productivity is regular removal of stationary cells and addition of new media to maintain photoautotrophic growth without forming excessive biofilms within the raceway. In addition, this photobioreactor experiment is not focusing on understanding genes required for growth in spaceflight conditions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Helisch et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>In yeast, competitive growth experiments in liquid culture were used to identify genes needed for survival in spaceflight conditions (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nislow et al., 2015</xref>). We are completing spaceflight experiments to determine similar gene sets for Chlamydomonas via competitive growth of mutagenized cells. Here we report results from our development of methods and experiment verification test (EVT). We describe a simple batch culture protocol using commercial FEP tissue culture bags that is adapted to the Veggie plant growth chambers on the ISS. Shortwave ultraviolet (UVC) light mutagenesis and full genome sequencing enabled the detection of new mutations in two microalgae strains. The spectrum of mutations identified suggests that UVC primarily induces DNA damage in Chlamydomonas via errors in translesion synthesis and double strand break repair. In addition, a variety of cellular information processing functions may need to be modified to adapt Chlamydomonas to this batch culture system.</p>

Strains were maintained at room temperature (20–25°C) on agar plates with Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gorman and Levine, 1965</xref>), under 50–100 μmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s continuous photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from daylight fluorescent bulbs (6500 K).</p>
                <p>To initiate liquid cultures, 1–2 mm colonies were scraped from TAP agar plate and inoculated into 50–100 mL TAP media. Traditional liquid cultures were grown with continuous light in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with 100 r/min gyratory shaking. For spaceflight analogs, liquid cultures were grown with continuous light in 120 mL PermaLife cell culture bags (OriGen Biomedical, Austin, TX, United States). Liquid cultures were grown in daylight fluorescent lighting or in the Veggie Vegetable Production System at the Kennedy Space Center (Merritt Island, FL, United States) with a ratio of red (630 nm): green (525 nm): blue (450 nm) of 8:1:1 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2016</xref>).

The petri plates were opened in a GS Gene Linker UV Chamber (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) and exposed to increasing doses of UVC light from germicidal bulbs. Petri plates were closed, wrapped in aluminum foil, and agitated overnight in the dark at 50 r/min. Mutagenized cultures were plated on TAP agar plates with non-treated samples diluted 1:5 prior to plating. Colonies were grown under continuous light, counted, and normalized relative to non-mutagenized cultures.</p>

For each mutagenesis, 7 mL of early-log phase culture was exposed to 8 mJ of UV light. The mutagenized cells were then used to inoculate 100 mL of TAP media in a PermaLife tissue culture bag in a sterile laminar flow hood.

FreeBayes v.1.2.0 (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>) was implemented with the pooled continuous option. LoFreq v. 2.1.3.1 used default parameters (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Wilm et al., 2012</xref>), while CRISP pooled, discrete parameters were: –poolsize 5 –perms 100000 –mmq 10 –minc 3 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bansal, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bansal et al., 2011</xref>). FreeBayes called more variants for libraries with the lowest depth giving a negative correlation between the number of mapped reads and number of variants detected.

Monomorphic variants revealed non-mutated, natural variants relative to the reference genome. In addition, variants with low depth and low-quality mapped reads were removed based on CRISP assignments of “LowDepth, LowMQ10 and LowMQ20.” Finally, novel variants were scored by identifying exact matches to natural variants reported from whole genome sequencing of 39 Chlamydomonas laboratory strains (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gallaher et al., 2015</xref>). Variant density was visualized by plotting SNPs detected in windows of 100, 400, 500, and 1000 kb.

In addition, the novel mutations are found at a higher allele frequency indicating that the novel mutations have more sequence read support across samples than natural variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). We conclude that novel variants better represent the UVC mutagenized sites.</p>

              <p>Centrifugation and freezing cell pellets for DNA sampling requires more extensive astronaut time and limiting resources on the ISS. We compared the mutations recovered from samples that had been frozen at the time of passage and those from live cultures that had been stored in the dark. There were no significant differences in sequencing depth based on the storage conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6C,D</xref>). However, dark storage decreased the number of mutations recovered in passage 1, which were cultures stored for 22 days prior to sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6E,F</xref>). Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests showed a significant reduction of mutations detected for the WT strain (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003), but the reduction was non-significant for <italic>cw15</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07). For frozen stored libraries, the number of novel mutations detected in each passage was nearly constant indicating sequencing depth was limiting for mutant detection. These results suggest that changes in allele frequency over culture passages are not a reliable indicator of selection for this experiment.</p>
              <p>To assess the effects of novel mutation on protein coding sequences, SnpEff was used to identify protein coding changes. Natural variants were enriched for synonymous mutations, while the novel variants were enriched for protein coding changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). These results are consistent with an increased frequency of deleterious mutations after UV mutagenesis. Individual genes were tested for selection based on nucleotide diversity (π) using SNPGenie. Novel variants were enriched for genes showing evidence of positive selection with about 46% of genes tested having π<sub>N</sub> &gt; π<sub>S</sub>, compared to 29% of all variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results are consistent with the enrichment for non-synonymous mutations resulting from UV mutagenesis.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>This EVT validated a strategy for identifying genes required by Chlamydomonas during log phase growth in spaceflight. We have shown that commercial FEP tissue culture bags can be used for batch culture of microalgae and result in 9–11 cell doublings during a 6 day culture. Cells in these cultures that divide normally will be at least 1000 fold enriched at stationary phase over cells with genetic variants that prevent mitotic division. Competition through multiple passages will eliminate mutations that prevent mitotic growth. Chlamydomonas is viable in these bags after prolonged dark storage, which enables full genome sequencing and identification of mutant genes in the culture. We have since used this strategy to grow the WT and <italic>cw15</italic> strains during the SpaceX CRS-15 mission; analysis of the spaceflight experiment is on-going.</p>
              <p>Whole genome sequencing has been used to assess the mutagenic load of the bacteria, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, in a 2 week spaceflight exposure (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Less than 40 SNPs were detected in the genome from spaceflight with similar numbers of SNPs detected on ground and in spaceflight. These data suggest that exogenous mutagenesis is necessary to gain adequate signal of selection in short-term competitive growth experiments.</p>
              <p>A yeast selection experiment was completed in spaceflight by using a genome-wide deletion collection (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nislow et al., 2015</xref>). The competitive growth experiment measured the reduction in representation of bar-coded mutants over the course of ∼21 mitotic generations. This type of competitive growth identifies individual genes needed for growth. By contrast, UVC mutagenesis has a higher genetic load and generates a more diverse array of allele types to compete within the culture. Moreover, three serial batch cultures of Chlamydomonas are expected to give ∼30 mitotic generations potentially giving more signal of selection within the genome sequence data.</p>
              <p>There are several limitations to the design of this competitive growth assay. The algae were grown in mixotrophic conditions with both acetate and light as sources of energy. The addition of acetate to the media promotes rapid growth of the cultures allowing up to four passages to be completed in a 1-month SpaceX commercial resupply mission. Consequently, genes under purifying selection are expected to include pathways to utilize acetate. Similarly, the Veggie growth chamber has a limited spectrum of lighting with three narrow wavelengths that do not include far-red light (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2016</xref>). Each wavelength has two to four light level settings, and the lighting needed to be enriched for red light to provide 80–100 μmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s of light to the culture bags. Limitations to random mutagenesis are that loss-of-function mutations in all genes are not represented in each biological replicate of the experiment and that multiple mutations are simultaneously selected in individual cells during mitotic divisions. Moreover, we found that all cultures had a high level of polymorphisms that were identical to previously described natural variants in laboratory strains (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gallaher et al., 2015</xref>). The sequencing depth and 30 mitotic generations of the experiment did not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in allele frequencies of individual natural variants. Consequently, we focused on selection signatures in novel mutations that were unique to UV mutagenized cultures.</p>
              <p>Ultraviolet light causes direct DNA damage to create cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and the UV mutation signature is typically biased toward C &gt; T transitions (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ikehata and Ono, 2011</xref>). Chlamydomonas DNA readily forms pyrimidine dimers, and WT strains have a robust dark-repair pathway to repair 90–95% of the DNA damage directly within 24 h (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Small, 1987</xref>). With whole genome sequencing, we observed enrichment for T &gt; G and C &gt; G transversions in the mutations resulting from the UV treatment instead of the expected C &gt; T transitions. Incorporation of several oxidative products of guanine can promote C &gt; G transversions in response to a variety of mutagens, including UV (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kino and Sugiyama, 2005</xref>). In human cancers, C &gt; G base changes are associated with activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases followed by error-prone translesion synthesis (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Forbes et al., 2017</xref>). Human cancers also have base substitution signatures that are enriched for T &gt; G, such as COSMIC signatures 17b and 28 (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Forbes et al., 2017</xref>). However, no specific mechanisms have been proposed for the specific enrichment of T &gt; G transversions.</p>
              <p>Intriguingly, we observed signatures of selection in DNA polymerase ζ, θ, and REV1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which are associated with translesion synthesis (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Sakamoto, 2019</xref>). In the human germ line, C &gt; G mutations have been suggested to be caused by errors in double-stand break repair (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). DNA polymerase θ and DNA ligase 4 function in the non-homologous end joining double strand break repair pathway, and we found evidence of selection for both of these enzymes in the EVT (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Pannunzio et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence for selection in double-strand break repair and translesion synthesis suggests that these pathways are likely relevant to the UV-induced mutations observed.</p>
              <p>The low sequence coverage of this experiment creates risk in using the frequency of recovery for specific mutant alleles in determining whether specific genes are under positive or purifying selection. The number of alleles discovered is limited by the sequencing depth, and higher coverage is necessary to increase the power of the statistics to detect selection at a genome-wide level. Nevertheless, we were able to classify 476 genes in the WT strain and 503 genes in the <italic>cw15</italic> strain for purifying or positive selection based on mutations within coding sequences. Among these, 104 genes were enriched for molecular functions based on GO terms. In addition to DNA repair pathways, these analyses revealed signal transduction and other information processing functions including, chromatin reading, RNA processing, and translation to be enriched within selected genes. The enriched molecular functions are predicted to be processes necessary for Chlamydomonas to adapt to the UV mutagenesis, lack of media agitation, the diffusion of gases across the FEP membrane, and the lighting conditions in the Veggie unit.</p>
              <p>Scalable production of Chlamydomonas in spaceflight has multiple potential applications. The species will accumulate lipids to about 20–25% of total biomass, which can be used as an organic chemical feedstock (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Becker, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Chlamydomonas also has high protein content of 40–60% of biomass making it a potential source of food. Although it is not yet designated as a GRAS organism by the FDA, Chlamydomonas is non-toxic; animal feeding studies show no harmful effects at 4 g algae biomass per kg body weight per day, the highest consumption levels tested (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Murbach et al., 2018</xref>). Equivalent consumption for a 65 kg person would be approximately 260 g of algae powder per day.</p>
              <p>As a genetic model organism, Chlamydomonas biomass composition can be further modified by mutagenesis or targeted gene editing. For example, starch over-accumulation mutants have been isolated that shift starch content from 15 to 30–35% of biomass (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Koo et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, CRISPR gene editing of the Chlamydomonas zeaxanthin epoxidase gene significantly increases carotenoids needed to prevent macular degeneration (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Baek et al., 2018</xref>). The modified algae strain was used to supplement chicken feed to increase the zeaxanthin content of eggs. The myriad of potential applications for microalgae production in spaceflight justify direct investigation of the genes needed for liquid culture production. Our current study shows both feasibility for a spaceflight experiment and identifies a series of cellular information processing genes that are likely required for Chlamydomonas to adapt to batch culture in breathable plastic bags.</p>
