                <p id="Par1">Between 1989 and 1995, NASA evaluated how increases in flight duration of up to 17 days affected the health and performance of Space Shuttle astronauts. Thirty-one Space Shuttle pilots participating in 17 space missions were tested at 3 different times before flight and 3 different times after flight, starting within a few hours of return to Earth. The astronauts moved their head and eyes as quickly as possible from the central fixation point to a specified target located 20°, 30°, or 60° off center. Eye movements were measured with electro-oculography (EOG). Head movements were measured with a triaxial rate sensor system mounted on a headband. The mean time to visually acquire the targets immediately after landing was 7–10% (30–34 ms) slower than mean preflight values, but results returned to baseline after 48 hours. This increase in gaze latency was due to a decrease in velocity and amplitude of both the eye saccade and head movement toward the target. Results were similar after all space missions, regardless of length.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">In 1989, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began a program to progressively lengthen Space Shuttle missions from 4 days to 17 days, and plans included missions of up to 28 days. Part of this program included a series of investigations to assess crew performance during and after the critical phases associated with Space Shuttle landings. Using data obtained during the first 24 Space Shuttle missions, investigators determined that the primary concerns were orthostatic intolerance and neurovestibular deficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite intensive simulator training, some Space Shuttle commanders and pilots were unable to land the Shuttle with the desired performance specifications after short (less than 8 days) missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Because the crew would continue to land the vehicle manually, keeping the autoland capability for an emergency backup only, landing proficiency was anticipated to degrade even more after extended Space Shuttle missions. However, no data was available to determine whether changes in landing proficiency might be related to the length of time spent in the microgravity environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The objective of the present study was to assess how astronauts perform a visual task that was required to pilot and land the Space Shuttle. We measured the eye and head movements of pilots as they acquired specific visual targets in the horizontal plane before and after they participated in a Space Shuttle mission of 6 to 17 days. If pilots are unable to adapt their eye-head coordination to the changes in gravitational environment they will have difficulty acquiring information from instrumentation or will have delays capturing visual targets. The risk is greater in situations that require constant vigilance, timely responses, and accurate visual target identification and/or location, such as during a Space Shuttle landing. On final approach for landing, the Space Shuttle’s speed exceeded 300 knots, and it descended nearly 53 m in altitude and traveled more than 145 m downrange during the time required for the pilot to acquire a single target displaced 30° to 60° from straight ahead. Therefore, there was concern that a delay in visual target acquisition might compromise the safety of crews on short-term as well as extended-duration flights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Previous reports have documented modifications in eye-head coordination during visual target acquisition and decreases in ocular saccadic performance in astronauts after they return from short duration spaceflights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, for these previous studies, data was collected one or two days after landing and the studies involved a very small number of participants. We were fortunate to collect data just a few hours after landing (on R + 0) from 31 astronauts, most of whom were Space Shuttle pilots. This larger number of participants allowed us to assess whether a correlation existed between the astronauts’ performance and the duration of their spaceflight. The results of our study provide a complete picture of the difficulties astronauts face when attempting to acquire specific visual targets after returning from short-duration spaceflight.</p>

The subjects were Space Shuttle commanders, pilots, or mission specialists with professional piloting experience. The NASA institutional review board for human testing approved all test procedures.

Eight subjects participated in one of 6 missions lasting from 6 to 9 days (mean 8.4); 14 subjects participated in one of 6 missions lasting from 10 to12 days (mean 11.0); and 9 subjects participated in one of 5 missions lasting from 14 to17 days (mean 15.0). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, flight duration increased progressively during the Extended Duration Orbiter Program, starting with STS-36 (4.5 days) and culminating with STS-72 (17 days). The investigation presented here began about 18 months into the program and was conducted from November 1991 to January 1996.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The NASA Extended Duration Orbiter Program included 41 Space Shuttle missions, beginning with the 33<sup>rd</sup> Space Shuttle mission.

                <p id="Par7">Our visual target acquisition experiment was one of 4 protocols to investigate changes in visual-vestibular interactions as a function of exposure to spaceflight: visual target acquisition, gaze stabilization, pursuit tracking, and sinusoidal oscillations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The crewmembers were tested at 3 different times before flight and 3 different times after the flight. Preflight testing took place at the NASA Johnson Space Center 120 days before launch, 30 days before launch, and 10 days before launch. Early postflight testing was performed on the landing site (either at NASA Kennedy Space Center or at NASA Dryden Space Research Center) within 2 hours of wheels stop (R + 0). Postflight testing was performed again at NASA Johnson Space Center 2 days after landing (R + 2) and 4 days after landing (R + 4) to track recovery to baseline.</p>

                <p id="Par8">Visual targets subtending 0.5° were fixed to a screen on a horizontal plane at 20°, 30°, and 60° angular distances to the right and the left of the subject’s straight-ahead view. The distance between the screen and the subjects was 75 cm. To easily differentiate between targets, each target had a different color according to the degree of angular offset from center. The subjects were instructed to use both their head and eyes to move their gaze as quickly and accurately as possible from the central fixation point to a specified target indicated by the operator. The order of the specified targets was randomly predefined. After each visual target acquisition the subjects returned their gaze to the center fixation position. During each test session, data was collected a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 times for each of the 6 target locations.</p>
                <p id="Par9">Horizontal eye movements were recorded with non-polarizing ECG electrodes positioned at the outer canthus of each eye, with a reference electrode located on the mastoid process behind the right ear. Head movements were recorded with a triaxial rate sensor system mounted on a headband that was attached firmly to the subject’s head. Eye movements were calibrated by having the subjects look at the same visual targets but without moving their head. Analog signals from the eye electrodes and rate sensors were amplified and digitized at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. To remove extraneous high-frequency noise, the measured wave forms were digitally filtered before being processed with a finite impulse response, low-pass Hamming window filter with a nominal cutoff frequency (−3 dB point) of 30 Hz. Data were passed through the filter twice—once forward in time and once backward in time to eliminate all phase shifts and double the stop-band attenuation.</p>

                <title>Data analysis</title>
                <p id="Par10">The eye position signal was differentiated to calculate eye velocity. The rate sensor signals were integrated to calculate head movement amplitude around the yaw, pitch, and roll axes. During visual target acquisition the head movement was almost exclusively around the yaw axis.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Responses for acquiring the target at each location were averaged for each subject. Additionally, all of the preflight measurements were averaged for each subject to provide a single preflight value for each target eccentricity against which the subsequent postflight data could be compared.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to analyze the normality of each variable. The peak velocity and peak amplitude of the primary eye saccade and head movement were analyzed separately using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Two-way repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted to compare the effects of test sessions (Pre, R + 0, R + 2, R + 4) and target positions (20°, 30°, 60°). Post hoc analyses to compare the preflight session and the postflight sessions used Bonferroni correction to reduce Type I error.</p>

                <title>Eye-head coordination</title>
                <p id="Par14">While acquiring images 20° and 30° off center in the horizontal plane, the eyes and the head make one single movement to the target. The head, having greater inertia than the eye, typically moves after the eye has moved in the orbit. Gaze is the direction of the visual axis with respect to space, which is defined as the sum of eye position with respect to the head, and head position with respect to space. At the end of the eye saccade the gaze has already reached its final position, but the head continues to move. The head movement stimulates the horizontal semicircular canals and produces an eye movement through the vestibulo-ocular reflex that is opposite in direction and velocity to that of the head. When moving to a target that is offset 60°, the gaze often undershoots the target by 5–10° and a corrective eye saccade occurs to reposition the gaze onto the target. In general, the total gaze movement is greater than the total head movement, so that the final position of the eye is offset in the direction of head movement. Comparison of the recordings obtained before and immediately after flight indicated that the amplitudes of the initial eye saccade and head movement were smaller and the duration of gaze movement to the target was longer after flight than before flight (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Recordings of eye, head, and gaze (sum of eye and head) positions during visual acquisition of a target 60° off center, obtained before (Pre) and immediately after (R + 0) the astronaut returned from a 16-day Space Shuttle mission.

                <title>Gaze latency</title>
                <p id="Par15">The delay between the start of the eye and head movements after flight (R + 0: 24.9 ± 32.4 ms) was not significantly different from the delay before flight (19.4 ± 25.6 ms), when the subjects took 350 to 440 ms to reach the target. This gaze latency increased as a function of the angular position of the target (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The effects of spaceflight on gaze latency were analyzed using a 3 targets (20°, 30°, 60°) × 4 sessions (Pre, R + 0, R + 2, R + 4) repeated-measures ANOVA, alpha = 0.05. There was a significant effect of target position [F (2,360) = 29.74, P &lt; 0.001] and a significant effect of spaceflight [F (3,360) = 2.76, P = 0.04] on gaze latency, but no significant interaction between target position and spaceflight [F (6,360) = 0.05, P = 0.99]. An increase in gaze latency was observed in more than two-thirds of the subjects on R + 0. The largest increase relative to preflight latency was 172 ms. When averaged across all subjects, the gaze latency for reaching the 30° and 60° targets increased relative to preflight latency by 34 ms (P = 0.024) and 30 ms (P = 0.006), respectively. Responses had returned to baseline on R + 2.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Gaze latency during visual acquisition of targets at 20°, 30°, and 60° off center before flight (Pre), immediately after landing (R + 0), and 2 days (R + 2) and 4 days (R + 4) later.

Spaceflight affected the peak amplitude of the head movement [F (3,360) = 4.38, P &lt; 0.01], but not the peak amplitude of the eye saccade (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

Each subject’s responses during visual target acquisition after spaceflight were normalized for each visual target according to their mean gaze latency before flight. Individual responses were then grouped by flight duration into 3 categories (short: 6–9 days; medium: 10–12 days; long: 13–17 days), and the group mean was calculated for each test session. The effects of spaceflight duration on the gaze latency were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA with 3 targets (20°, 30°, 60°) × 3 durations (short, medium, long). There was no significant effect of target [F (2,360) = 0.23, P = 0.79] or spaceflight duration [F (2,360) = 1.41, P = 0.26] on gaze latency.

              <p id="Par22">The results of this study indicate that the time to acquire a visual target located 30° and 60° off center in the horizontal plane increased by 7–10% (30–34 ms) during the first few hours after return form space. This could potentially result in piloting errors because the astronauts will experience delays capturing operationally relevant targets during the critical period when they are returning to Earth. Time delays to acquire visual targets were consistent after short- (6–9 days), medium- (10–13 days), and long- (14–17 days) duration Space Shuttle missions. Responses returned to normal 48 hours after landing. The increase in gaze latency was attributed to a decrease in velocity and amplitude of both the initial eye saccade and head movement toward the target.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Data on acquiring horizontal visual targets during spaceflight are rare and results are conflicting. Some researchers have reported increased latencies of eye saccade and decreased peak velocities during flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, whereas others have reported opposite effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The studies that showed diminished performance were conducted early in flight and often involved motion-sick subjects, whereas the study by Uri <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, reporting enhanced performance, was conducted on the seventh day in space. Horizontal-pursuit eye movements and the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during active or passive head oscillations in yaw were unchanged during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. By contrast, spaceflight did affect vertical-pursuit eye movements and the vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex gain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Upward pursuit was accomplished primarily by saccades and downward pursuit by a combination of saccades and smooth eye movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Gaze behavior quickly readapts after these flights, often resolving within one day of return to Earth.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Longer spaceflights on board Mir and the International Space Station have allowed time for substantial adaptation to the 0 <italic>g</italic> environment, and astronauts who have participated in these missions have had decreases in performance that persisted for several days after landing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Changes relative to preflight measurements were observed in vertical smooth pursuit and gaze stabilization during head and eye movements in the vertical plane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Responses in the horizontal plane were not affected. However, in these studies the earliest postflight measurements took place one or two days after the landing of the Soyuz capsule in Kazakhstan, so the responses in the horizontal plane could have already readapted. The present study is the first report of changes in acquiring horizontal visual targets with both eye and head movements in astronauts within a few hours of return from space.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Our subjects’ eye and head movements before spaceflight were comparable to eye movements that were measured in ground-based subjects using EOG and eye coil techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Current models of eye-head coordination postulate that a vestibular signal serves as an integral component of saccadic spatial programming during head-free gaze shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In these models, the desired gaze position is compared to an internal representation of the actual gaze position. This internal representation of gaze position is the sum of the perceived eye position in the head (derived from the efferent copy) and the perceived head position in space (derived from vestibular inputs). The difference between desired and actual gaze position produces a gaze position error signal that drives saccadic motor output until the error signal is cancelled (using visual feedback) and eye movement stops. The gaze movement is shared between the head and eyes, clearly a functionally advantageous manoeuver since the head and eyes are individually limited to lateral angular excursions of approximately ±75° and ±45° respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par26">A number of investigators have assessed the role of vestibular-based subsystems during and immediately after spaceflight (see review in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>). Several strategies persist as long as astronauts are in microgravity, including (1) reduced use of head movements, (2) reliance on an internal (intrinsic) coordinate system for spatial orientation, and (3) compensation for the changing role of proprioceptive information. Strategies that developed during spaceflight are still used immediately after return from spaceflight. If the newly acquired behavior is not appropriate, responses result in performance decrements, particularly in off-nominal situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Because head movements provoke motion sickness during reentry, it is possible that the subjects reduced their head movements immediately after spaceflight to avoid discomfort. Also, the neck muscles could be weakened due to unloading of the head in microgravity. These factors could explain the increased latency for head movements and by association eye movements because the two systems are connected. However, pursuit eye movements that occur without head movements are also altered after spaceflight. These alterations have been attributed to changes in the tonic levels of otolith activity in the vestibulo-cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par28">On Earth, the otoliths help the brain interpret the position of the head in space by detecting head tilt relative to gravity. In the absence of a gravitational reference during spaceflight, the static otolith signals are no longer effective, and visual and proprioceptive cues are primarily used to interpret the position of the head. During return to a 1<italic>g</italic> environment, otolith inputs are restored and proprioceptive information changes. Recent clinical studies suggest that altered vestibular and somatosensory inputs may lead to changes in an individual’s mental representation of space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A misinterpretation of the head’s position in space could result in a misperception of gaze position, which would slow head and eye movement while acquiring visual targets. According to this hypothesis, the perceived direction of gaze is altered in astronauts immediately after spaceflight. To verify this hypothesis, we are currently conducting an investigation to determine if astronauts perceive straight-ahead direction differently after they return from spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par29">As indicated above, few studies have demonstrated a direct effect of spaceflight on saccade gain; however, ground-based studies have shown that spatial targeting of saccades may depend on the g vector. For example, on Earth eye saccades systematically tilt as a function of head tilt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and directional errors of saccades to recollected targets increase during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Altered visually-guided saccades, vestibulo-ocular reflex, and eye-hand coordination strategies have also been observed during exposure to very brief periods (20 s) of microgravity and hypergravity during parabolic flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. An important question is whether changes in eye-head coordination will also occur during short periods of reduced and enhanced gravity such as during sub-orbital flights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Some commercial companies plan to fly space planes that will provide reduced gravity for 3–5 minutes and then land conventionally on a runway. The increase in gaze latency observed in the present study could therefore be a potential issue for the pilots of these sub-orbital flight vehicles during landing.</p>
