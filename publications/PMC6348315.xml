                <p>A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (<italic>OMG1</italic>) as being ROS-associated. The <italic>OMG1</italic> 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of <italic>MYB77</italic> and <italic>GRX480</italic>, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.</p>

              <p>The complex networks and signalling pathways that equip plants to cope with environmental challenge developed over evolutionary time in terrestrial environments. Exposing plants to novel environments presents opportunities to understand how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience. Spaceflight is one such novel environment, and understanding how plants function outside of Earth’s boundaries is also integral to space exploration. Plants respond to spaceflight in ways that are dependent on species, ecotype, genetics and even organs (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Cowles <italic>et al.</italic> 1984</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Hoson <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0079" ref-type="bibr">Soga <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Ferl <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). Indeed, even a single gene difference can influence the spaceflight response (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), thus investigating ecotype-dependent spaceflight transcriptomes can reveal strategies for physiological adaptation to spaceflight while expanding understanding of gene function in terrestrial environments.</p>
              <p>The physiological impact of spaceflight is reflected in the patterns of gene expression. Irrespective of plant growth hardware, duration in space or age of plants, one consensus is that spaceflight elicits responses from pathways associated with cell wall remodelling, cell polarity, phytohormone-mediated processes, as well as general stress responses, such as wounding, pathogen defence, heat shock and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Joo <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Correll <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0092" ref-type="bibr">Zupanska <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Ferl <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Mazars <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0091" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kwon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Schüler <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). In addition, a large proportion of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight encode unknown proteins.</p>
              <p>Spaceflight-grown <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots tend to be smaller, have fewer lateral roots and shorter root hair development than their terrestrial controls (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kwon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Aspects of these morphologies in ecotype Columbia (Col-0) suggest a relationship between the down-regulation of several peroxidase genes in spaceflight (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kwon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>).</p>
              <p>In this study, a spaceflight-induced gene of unknown function identified from roots was investigated for its potential involvement in ROS-related functions. AT1G05290, which we have dubbed <italic>Orbitally Manifested Gene 1</italic> (<italic>OMG1</italic>), was one of the highest significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0005) induced genes in the Advanced Plant Experiment 01 (APEX01) spaceflight data set (fold change = 12) (<xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2013a</xref>). Two distinct biochemical assays typically used to measure ROS activity indicated that knocking out OMG1 alters the production of ROS. Co-expression networks around <italic>OMG1</italic> show correlations to genes involved in ROS-associated oxidative phosphorylation pathways <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Obayashi <italic>et al</italic>. 2014</xref>. <italic>OMG1</italic> was also expressed in organs known to highly utilize ROS during development, such as root hairs and pollen tubes (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Schachtman 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">Potocký <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0086" ref-type="bibr">Winter <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">Lassig <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). In addition, <italic>OMG1</italic> is an unrealized member of the CONSTANS-Like family of transcription factors. These findings, originating with the novel environment of spaceflight, further the understanding of plant growth and development and provide insight into the role of a heretofore unknown gene.</p>

                <p>The ROSMETER tool assesses the ROS-related transcriptomic signature in a large-scale <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene expression data set (<xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">Rosenwasser <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene expression profiles from two independent spaceflight experiments, APEX01 and Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2 (APEX03-2), along with their corresponding ground controls, were used to correlate differential gene expression in spaceflight with specific ROS species and origins. The APEX01 experiment utilized two ecotypes and both were planted on each plate of the experiment. Since the entire plate was harvested on orbit to a single tube, the subsequent transcriptomic analyses comprised 60 % Wassilewskija (WS) and 40 % Col-0 (<xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2013b</xref>). In the APEX03-2 data set, WS and Col-0 were kept on separate plates, harvested into separate tubes and analysed individually. A data set from Col-0 compared to WS vertically grown in standard laboratory conditions was included as an additional control (<xref rid="CIT0072" ref-type="bibr">Schultz <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). From each data set, Affymetrix Probeset-ID, Gene Locus ID, <italic>P</italic>-value and fold change were listed and submitted to ROSMETER. The heatmap was constructed using the GENE-E software with hierarchical clustering using the Matrix value offered in the software.</p>

                <title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title>
                <p>Seeds from both Col-0 and WS were prepared for APEX01 and APEX03-2 as previously described (<xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">Sng <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Ferl and Paul 2016</xref>). Briefly, plants were cultured on Phytagel™ 10 cm Petri plates and grown either in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware (APEX01), or in the Veggie hardware (APEX03-2) under continuous lighting of ~80–135 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PAR. In this study, the effects of the spaceflight environment were evaluated, which includes ambient radiation, microgravity and attending effects on convection. In both experiments, the ground control plants were grown with a 24- to 48-h schedule delay that allowed the comparable ground growth chambers to be programmed with the precise environmental conditions that the International Space Station (ISS)-grown plants received on orbit.</p>
                <p>Plants grown for additional laboratory analyses were grown on Phytagel™ 10 cm plates or in soil, and placed in a greenhouse growth chamber on a 24-h light cycle (~80 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> PAR) at 22 °C.</p>

                <title>OMG1 promoter::GUSmgfp5 transgenic plants and analyses</title>
                <p>A 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region upstream of the OMG1 (AT1G05290) initial Met was amplified from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gDNA using primer pair A <bold>[see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"><bold>Supporting Information—Table S1</bold></xref><bold>]</bold>, which contains restriction enzyme sites BamHI in the forward primer and NcoI in the reverse. The sequenced and confirmed BamHI/NcoI fragment containing the OMG1 5′ flanking region was cloned into pCAMBIA1303 to create the OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 fusion construct. Although this region may not represent the full complement of motifs that regulate OMG1, the 0.8-kb 5′ flanking region does serve to promote OMG1 transcription and will be referred to as the basal promoter. The construct was then transformed into <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> (<italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>) strain GV3101 for floral dip transformation into WS plants (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Clough and Bent 1998</xref>). Ten independent OMG1p::GUSmgfp5 transgenic lines grown on selection media (250 mg L<sup>−1</sup> Carbenecillin and 50 mg L<sup>−1</sup> Hygromycin) were screened for T3 homozygosity. Plants grown on Phytagel plates were used for histochemical localization of β-glucuronidase (GUS) (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Jefferson <italic>et al.</italic> 1987</xref>).</p>
                <p>Pollen and pollen tube analyses were performed as described (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>). T1 heterozygous populations of pollen grains and tubes were incubated with X-Gluc to reveal the specificity of the histochemical localization in transformed pollen. Basal OMG1 promoter activity in plants requires ~3 h of staining before detection of GUS in the various locations, whereas GUS activity induced by wounding was observed within 30 min of staining.</p>
                <p>In the GUS qRT-PCR wounding experiments with OMG1p::GUSmgfp5, comparable leaves from three individual plants were crimped with forceps and left intact on the plant for the duration of each time point (30 min, 1, 4 and 16 h). Leaves were harvested to liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction.

                <p>The differential gene expression data sets of the three independent spaceflight experiments and their comparable ground controls were used in the ROSMETER analyses. The heatmap shows the positive-(red), negative-(blue) and no correlation-(black) between the ROS indices and the queried spaceflight transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). A general positive correlation of ROS-producing genes was observed in all the spaceflight transcriptomes and hierarchical clustering displayed a higher similarity with the APEX03-2_WS data set compared to the APEX03-2_Col-0 data set. Two interesting ROS correlation groups were observed in the heatmap. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-<italic>APX1</italic>) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ROS indices, whereas in the Col-0 background cytosolic ROS shows no correlation. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. Specifically, TDNA-AOX-MLD and Retenone-3h indices showed that if one ecotype had a positive correlation the other had no correlation. In addition, in the Retenone-12h and TDNA-AOX indices, the mixed ecotype transcriptome shows a similar trend to one of the two ecotypes. The control data set, which reflects terrestrial ecotype differences between Col-0 and WS, showed that many of the genes differentially expressed between the two ecotypes are associated with the ROS-scavenging mechanism. A representative transcriptome heatmap from the APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment that compared several significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) differentially expressed (&gt;1 or −1 &lt; log2 fold change) peroxidase genes between 4-day-old Col-0 and WS ecotypes illustrated that Col-0 alters the expression of many more peroxidase genes in spaceflight than does WS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>).

                    <p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation upon wounding and flg22 induction is altered in <italic>omg1</italic> leaves compared to Col-0 leaves. (A and B) DCF-DA ROS assay performed on wounded leaf tissues reveals that OMG1 affects cellular ROS production. (A) DCF-DA is a fluorogenic dye that measures hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cell. A pipette tip was used to wound the surface of the leaves from the WT line, <italic>omg1</italic> KO line and <italic>rbohd</italic> KO line (a known ROS-deficient mutant). Upon wounding, ROS is usually produced around the site of injury. The DCF-DA reagent is then oxidized by ROS resulting in appearance of green fluorescence. Plants were wounded and immediately placed in the DCF-DA solution for 20 min before visualized on the light microscope. (i) WT Col-0 leaves without wounding, (ii) WT Col-0 leaves, (iii) <italic>omg1</italic> leaves and (iv) <italic>rbohd</italic> leaves were placed in DCF-DA solution immediately after wounding. In the WT plants green fluorescence around the wound site indicates the production of ROS. However, in the <italic>omg1</italic> KO line and the <italic>rbohd</italic> KO line, ROS production was not detected. Images were taken on the Olympus BX51 compound scope at 10× magnification, exposure time 55 ms. Scale bars: 100 µm. (B) Quantification of fluorescence was performed using integrated density (IntDen) and corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) [CTCF = Integrated density − (Area of selected cell × Mean fluorescence of background readings)] in ImageJ. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, bar graphs with different letters show significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). (C and D) Higher elicitor-induced oxidative burst in <italic>omg1</italic> KO is not associated with altered expression of <italic>RbohD</italic>. (C) Extracellular ROS production was measured using a luminol-based assay in leaf discs from <italic>omg1</italic> KO, <italic>rbohd</italic> KO and WT Col-0 plants after elicitation with water or flg22. Experiments were repeated at least three times and results are a mean of 24 samples. (D) The relative expression of RbohD in the WT (Col-0) and <italic>omg1</italic> KO leaves was analysed in a wounding assay untouched leaves (mock), immediately after wounding, 10-min post-wounding and 1-h post-wounding. The average relative expression was normalized to a housekeeping gene (UBQ11) and presented relative to the mock controls. No significant difference in RbohD expression between Col-0 and omg1 KO plants was observed when the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test analysis was performed. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean of triplicate representative experiments.</p>

However, no OMG1-related sequences from Eudicots were observed outside the Brassicaceae family, suggesting that either OMG1 was lost from non-Brassica dicots, or the sequence has diverged so much in these lineages as to be unrecognizable.

                <p>The high level of sequence divergence in the OMG1 B-box1 domain is primarily due to a 13-amino acid deletion close to the start of the B-box1 consensus sequence CX-------------XAXLCX<sub>2</sub>CDX<sub>3</sub>H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This B-box1 deletion was observed across several <italic>Brassica</italic> sequences nested within the OMG1 clade, but this deletion was not found in monocot OMG1, suggesting it probably occurred late in the Brassicaceae lineage. Although the OMG1 B-box2 domain is largely conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>), two highly conserved consensus amino acids are different in OMG1 compared to the consensus sequence CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>7-10</sub>CX<sub>7</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>5-12</sub>H.

              <p>As sessile organisms, plants have developed sensitive, adaptive strategies to regulate their metabolism in a changing environment (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Noctor <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzländer and Finkemeier 2012</xref>). A strategy to avoid oxidative damage relies on the ability to deploy different antioxidants and ROS-scavenging/detoxifying enzymes to efficiently adjust their redox states. When subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight, plants respond by overexpressing more ROS- or redox-associated genes than comparable plants on the ground (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Im <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0065" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0066" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Correll <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0080" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto <italic>et al.</italic> 2014</xref>). ROS in its various forms and subcellular production sites can elicit distinct and diverse physiological, biochemical and molecular responses (<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">Mittler <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Gadjev <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0082" ref-type="bibr">Swanson and Gilroy 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0081" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). It is possible that plants drew from diverse ROS response strategies to cope with spaceflight, an environment that is outside their evolutionary experience and therefore potentially stressful. The data presented here suggest that <italic>OMG1</italic> is a putative regulator of the ROS signalling pathway associated with wounding and may play a prominent role in regulating the spaceflight ROS response, especially in the WS ecotype where it is strongly induced by spaceflight.</p>

                <title>Spaceflight induces the differential expression of ROS-producing genes in an ecotype-dependent manner</title>
                <p>In general, the differentially expressed genes in spaceflight showed a positive correlation to genes producing ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>). Although it is known that ecotype differences can diversify the ROS signatures associated with stress responses on Earth (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Kalbina and Strid 2006</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), these results are the first to demonstrate that different ecotypes use different specific subcellular ROS species to respond to the spaceflight environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Previous morphological differences between Col-0 and WS ecotypes in the spaceflight environment were primarily observed in the roots. Although the overall root length at 11 days on orbit between the two ecotypes showed no significant difference (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>), it was noted that the Col-0 ecotype showed a dramatic lag in root development during the first 48-h post-germination in orbit when compared to the WS ecotype, and that there are also ecotype-specific differences in root growth behaviour (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2012a</xref>). One difference between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes is the regulation of class III peroxidase genes (<xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">Passardi <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). In fact, two genes <italic>PE10</italic> (AT1G49570) and <italic>PE59</italic> (AT5G19890) that were up-regulated in the APEX03-2 Col-0 but remained unchanged in APEX03-2 WS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) are involved in controlling the root cell elongation process (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Markakis <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>). The differentially expressed peroxidase genes between the two ecotypes in the APEX03-2 spaceflight transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>) reinforce the notion that different ecotypes utilize ROS differently to respond to their environment and suggest that in WS, these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged. In addition, the observed down-regulation of peroxidases in Col-0 was consonant with observations previously published (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Kwon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Since peroxidases are necessary for the general oxidoreduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in general, the down-regulation of peroxidases in spaceflight within Col-0 could contribute to Col-0-specific ROS signatures seen in clusters A and B of the ROSMETER analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
                <p>The current ROSMETER analysis is not intended to define how specific ecotypes utilize peroxidases or regulate specific ROS indices in response to spaceflight. Rather, it is to illustrate that the genetic background of the spaceflight-grown plant had a substantial impact on the specific subcellular ROS species that were used in the physiological response.</p>

These results suggest that OMG1 is involved in a rapid wounding response in both Col-0 and WS ecotypes but with different modes of regulation.</p>
                <p>The WS and Col-0 ecotypes are genotypically distinct, and their transcriptomic responses to environmental and developmental cues can be dissimilar (e.g. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Kusunoki <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). The overall spaceflight transcriptomes of WS and Col-0 are dramatically different (<xref rid="CIT0063" ref-type="bibr">Paul <italic>et al.</italic> 2017</xref>). It is hypothesized that even though OMG1 is functional in both ecotypes upon wounding, other gene products or pathways present in Col-0 but not WS could compensate for the ‘need’ for OMG1 in space, or that these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged in the spaceflight transcriptome. Although OMG1’s role in the physiological adaptation of WS to spaceflight has yet to be discerned, its strong induction suggests that OMG1 contributes to a successful adjustment to that environment. Irrespective of OMG1’s specific role in spaceflight physiology, it is noteworthy that OMG1’s overall metabolic function, which was previously unknown, was only discovered because of its role in spaceflight physiology.</p>

Rapid induction of transcription (prior to 2-min post-stimulus) has been observed in gravitational and mechanical stimulation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root apical tissues (<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">Kimbrough <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>). In addition, wounding <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves produces ROS within minutes at the wound site (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Beneloujaephajri <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) and this rapid response is necessary for plants to elicit immediate defence/repair mechanisms against herbivore and pathogen attacks. Wounded plants can transmit rapid RBOHD-dependent ROS signals of speeds up to 8.4 cm min<sup>−1</sup> to mediate long-distance cell-to-cell communication (<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). However, since no statistical differences were seen in the expression level of <italic>RbohD</italic> in Col-0 WT plants and <italic>omg1</italic> KO plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>), this suggests that the changes in extracellular or intracellular ROS are not a result of altered expression of <italic>RbohD</italic> in the <italic>omg1</italic> KO line.</p>
                <p>Reactive oxygen species molecules are essential signalling molecules in plant growth and development but can also act as toxic stressors. Therefore, there exists an elaborate and highly redundant network of genes that maintain the delicate ROS homeostasis (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Gechev <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Functional OMG1 is necessary for rapid generation of intracellular ROS at the wound site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>). However, over time these ROS return to WT levels, presumably facilitated by other genes of redundant function <bold>[see</bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1"><bold>Supporting Information—Fig. S6</bold></xref><bold>]</bold>.</p>
                <p>In a recent review, it has been suggested that altered ROS signalling in response to the spaceflight environment could affect plant growth and development indirectly via changes in hormonal influx within the plants (<xref rid="CIT0071" ref-type="bibr">Schüler <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). OMG1 was found to regulate the expression of ROS-associated genes <italic>GRX480</italic> and <italic>MYB77</italic>. GRX480/GRXC9 is a member of the glutaredoxin (GRX) family of small redox enzymes. GRX480 is a salicylic acid (SA)-responsive gene induced quickly and transiently by an NPR1-independent pathway, which is associated with the ROS-scavenging/antioxidant network (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Laporte <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">Zander <italic>et al.</italic> 2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Herrera-Vásquez <italic>et al.</italic> 2015a</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Huang <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>). <italic>MYB77</italic> is a member of the R2R3-type transcription factor family that is involved in ROS metabolism through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The MAPK cascade is also known to play a role in plant development and hormone signalling and includes hormones such as jasmonic acid (JA), SA and ethylene (ET) (<xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">Shin and Schachtman 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">Teige <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">Galvez-Valdivieso <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Herrera-Vásquez <italic>et al.</italic> 2015b</xref>).</p>
                <p>OMG1’s role in ROS signalling was established with two frequently used ROS biochemical assays. The DCF-DA assay showed that intracellular ROS production around the wound site was dampened in the <italic>omg1</italic> mutant, whereas flg22-induced extracellular ROS production was 20 % higher than WT in the <italic>omg1</italic> mutant. These conflicting results can be addressed by the different signalling pathways elicited by each stimulus. Responses to mechanical damage can be localized, systemic or both. In any case, the response involves the generation, translocation, perception and transduction of wound signals to activate the expression of wound‐inducible genes. In response to mechanical wounding, the central role for JA signalling is well established. However, many other compounds, such as oligopeptide systemin, oligosaccharides, phytohormones, hydraulic pressure or electrical pulses, have also been proposed to play a role in wound signalling (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">León <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). Early localized ROS induced by wounding, specifically O<sub>2</sub>•−, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and singlet oxygen, have been suggested to originate intracellularly from the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplasts (<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">Morker and Roberts 2011</xref>).</p>
                <p>On the other hand, flg22, a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP), elicits an early response that includes SA-, JA- and ET-defence signalling pathways. Flg22 also elicits a late response that includes activation of defence-related senescence processes, SA-dependent secretory pathway genes and pathogenesis-related protein 1 (<italic>PR1</italic>) expression (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Denoux <italic>et al.</italic> 2008</xref>). MAMP-induced ROS have been shown to originate from the apoplast through activation of NADPH oxidases as well as peroxidases (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Jwa and Hwang 2017</xref>). Although there are crosstalks between signalling pathways induced by mechanical wounding and flg22, there are also unique pathways induced by each stimulus that could attribute to the different results observed. Details of these mechanisms are still being investigated; however, the results infer that within the Brassicaceae family OMG1 does play a role in the ROS signalling pathway.</p>

                <title>Phylogeny and protein architecture of OMG1</title>
                <p>Prior to this study, members of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CO and COL family were thought to only function in photoperiod signalling that involves flowering, circadian rhythms, stomata opening and root-shoot branching (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Gangappa and Botto 2014</xref>). Evidence presented here suggests that members of this family play a role in ROS signalling. This, in turn, could aid in the functional characterization of many of the other uncharacterized members such as COL11 and COL12. We suggest that divergent function of OMG1 can be attributed to the evolved B-box1 and B-box2 domains. This is in line with reports on the rapid evolution of COL genes within the Brassicaceae, in which the increased evolutionary rates were observed not only in the middle region of the protein but also in the conserved zinc-finger and basic CCT regions (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Lagercrantz and Axelsson 2000</xref>).</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>OMG1 is a CCT domain transcriptional regulator of ROS homeostasis, one that is important to the physiological adaptation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotype WS to spaceflight. While investigations are underway to determine the detailed mechanisms of how OMG1 regulates the ROS homeostasis in wounding, and its specific role in spaceflight, the results presented here demonstrate several important concepts for general consideration. First, spaceflight experiments are useful platforms to discover novel gene functions and provide fundamental insights into terrestrial plant biology. Second, the response to spaceflight is genotype-specific and this understanding should be taken into consideration when defining the overall plant spaceflight response. WS and Col-0 differ in induction of OMG1 in spaceflight. Third, the maintenance of ROS homeostasis plays an important role as plants physiologically adapt to spaceflight. And, last, the CONSTANS-Like family contains members that function well beyond the clock and timing roles typically associated with CCT domains, including ROS signalling.</p>
