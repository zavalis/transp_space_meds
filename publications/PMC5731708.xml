                <p>The multiple extremes resistant bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> is able to withstand harsh conditions of simulated outer space environment. The Tanpopo orbital mission performs a long-term space exposure of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> aiming to investigate the possibility of interplanetary transfer of life. The revealing of molecular machinery responsible for survivability of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> in the outer space environment can improve our understanding of underlying stress response mechanisms. In this paper, we have evaluated the molecular response of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> after the exposure to space-related conditions of UVC irradiation and vacuum. Notably, scanning electron microscopy investigations showed that neither morphology nor cellular integrity of irradiated cells was affected, while integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis revealed numerous molecular alterations in metabolic and stress response pathways. Several molecular key mechanisms of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the DNA damage response systems, ROS scavenging systems and transcriptional regulators responded in order to cope with the stressful situation caused by UVC irradiation under vacuum conditions. These results reveal the effectiveness of the integrative proteometabolomic approach as a tool in molecular analysis of microbial stress response caused by space-related factors.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The Gram positive bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> is extremely resistant to several environmental conditions, such as ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], UV radiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], oxidation stress [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and desiccation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Such a multifaceted resistance of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> ensures its potential to survive in the harsh outer space environment during interplanetary transfer. The Tanpopo, which means dandelion in Japanese, mission [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] includes a long-term exposure (separate experiments between one to three years) of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> on the Japan Experimental Module of the International Space Station (ISS) in the low Earth orbit (LEO). It is performed in order to validate the panspermia theory [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]—the possible transfer of life between Earth and extra-terrestrial bodies. To ensure that <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> is suitable for a long term exposure experiment on the ISS, several preliminary exposure experiments have been performed by Kawaguchi, Yang [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During these experiments, the different parameters (heavy ion beam radiation, temperature cycles, vacuum and UVC radiation) were adapted to mirror LEO conditions and the following survival tests revealed that UVC radiation had the highest impact on cell survivability [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It was shown that, even though <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> possesses high tolerance against UVC radiation, direct exposure of monolayers to LEO conditions results in no survival [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, aggregated <italic>Deinococci</italic> cells exposed to UVC radiation showed that they should withstand solar UV radiation on the ISS for one year as multilayers of dehydrated cells, and survive, wherein upper cellular layers cover and protect underlying inner cells. Approximately 200 μm of cell layers are necessary to shield the inner layers of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> efficiently from solar UV radiation. Based on these findings, massapanspermia has been proposed, implying that apart from rocks which shield the microbes against solar UV radiation (i.e., lithopanspermia), it is possible for cell-aggregates to function as a protective ark for interplanetary transfer of microbes, where upper layers shield lower layers from the harmful environment [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Proving this theory is a part of the Tanpopo mission, as cell aggregates with different thicknesses of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> are directly exposed to LEO conditions. These factors are microgravity, vacuum down to 10<sup>−7</sup> Pa, solar UV radiation, galactic radiation, solar cosmic radiation, van Allen Belts and temperature cycles (from -120°C up to 120°C every 90 min) [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Complementing survivability studies, an approach to unravel the response to LEO conditions on a molecular level is desirable, as it might provide an explanation how it is possible for certain organisms to survive under such extreme conditions. A systems biology approach, especially the combination of several–omics analysis, improves the knowledge of microbial stress response mechanisms and explains how microorganisms respond to environmental changes on the molecular level. Environmental stresses can damage cells due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and oxidative DNA damage. Exogenous factors can further interfere with genome integrity as they cause double strand breaks, primarily induced by vacuum and single strand breaks, primarily induced by UVC irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to breaks, three major classes of bipyrimidine photoproducts (BPPs), cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, pyrimidine 6–4 pyrimidone photoproducts and Dewar isomers, are formed if organic material is exposed to UVC radiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although there is no evidence that the DNA damage repair mechanism is very different in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> compared to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the number of BPPs after UVC irradiation of 500 Jm<sup>-2</sup> being comparable between <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurians</italic> is about 25 times more resistant to BPPs compared to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The reason for this higher resistance lies in the protection of intracellular proteins against UV induced oxidative damage [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, as the amount of DNA damage caused by UVC irradiation and desiccation is severe, an efficient DNA repair mechanism is still important. Two separate nucleotide excision repair pathways act simultaneously to remove BPPs [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The pathways rely on the proteins UV DNA damage endonuclease (<italic>uvsE</italic>) and UvrABC system protein A (<italic>uvrA</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both pathways require the proofreading DNA polymerase I (<italic>polA</italic>), as mutants without the <italic>polA</italic> gene are extremely sensitive to UVC irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another essential protein for enzymatic repair of DNA damage is RecA, which cleaves the repressor LexA that represses SOS response genes, like DNA repair enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. After successful excision, recombinational repair is performed. The genome repair does not rely on a new pathway for double-strand break repair, caused by desiccation stress, but is rather a set of recombinational DNA repair functions which can be observed in many other species [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Important proteins for the recombination process are gyrases (<italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic>), which cause negative supercoils to favor strand separation, DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; PprA to stimulate the end-joining reaction catalyzed by DNA ligases [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the different single-stranded DNA binding proteins DdrA [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], DdrB [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], DdrC [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and DdrD [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for RecA independent genome reconstruction processes.</p>
              <p>The aim of this study was to decipher the molecular response of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> to space-related conditions of UVC radiation and vacuum using the experimental set-up of Tanpopo orbital project. Here we present an integrative proteometabolomic approach applied to reveal key components of the molecular mechanism of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> survivability in response to UVC irradiation under vacuum conditions.</p>

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is responsible for the connection between glycolysis and TCA cycle as it converts pyruvate to coenzyme A, consists of three subunits. The E1 component (aceE) shows a high abundance in the irradiated cells, whereas the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (DR_0032) is more abundant in the control cells. However, according to the KEGG database, another acetyltransferase DR_0256 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>), which is more abundant in the irradiated cells, is also active in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The third subunit, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DR_2370) is not significantly higher abundant in any of the two conditions. Further identified and quantified proteins, which are all part of the TCA cycle, are citrate synthase (gltA), aconitate hydratase (acn), isocitrate dehydrogenase (DR_1540), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (sucA), dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DR_0083), succinate-CoA ligase (sucC), succinyl-CoA synthetase (sdhB), fumarate hydratase (fumC) and malate dehydrogenase (mdh).</p>

                <title>Overall alterations in the proteome of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> after UVC/vacuum exposure</title>
                <p>Proteomic analysis revealed that functional categories of cysteine, methionine and tryptophan metabolism, RNA degradation, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were overrepresented in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> exposed to UVC/vacuum conditions compared with the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g004">Fig 4</xref>). A previous study [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed similar categories of differentially expressed genes after gamma-irradiation. In opposite, the proteins of alanine, aspartate and glutamine metabolism were downregulated in irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. Methionine and cysteine as sulfur-containing amino acids greatly contribute to the antioxidant defense system and are key constituents in the regulation of cell metabolism. Apart from structural and catalytic role in proteins, cysteine chemistry is important to the enzymatic mechanism of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin superfamily, such as thioredoxins, glutaredoxin, and protein disulfide isomerase [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The levels of the proteins involved in cysteine biosynthesis, including thioredoxin reductase and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase, were highly upregulated in irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Surface exposed methionines serve as potent endogenous antioxidants to protect other functionally essential residues from oxidative damage [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Methionines are readily oxidized to methionine sulfoxide by many ROS. Methionine sulfoxides can be then subsequently converted back to methionines with the help of methionine sulfoxide reductases Msr [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Significant upregulation (p-value 0.043) of MsrA was observed after the exposure of cells to UVC/vacuum conditions as one of the most obvious responses of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> to oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>
                <p>The Fisher Exact test revealed a high enrichment factor for proteins connected to the TCA cycle and different amino acid pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Apart from that, RNA degradation enzymes, which dispose the damaged RNA, are enriched in the UVC irradiated under vacuum conditions cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. Finally, proteins related to the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis are enriched in the irradiated cells too, indicating an increased demand of protein synthesis. These proteins catalyze the esterification of a specific amino acid to its appropriate tRNA to form an aminoacyl tRNA. In the ribosome, the amino acid is transferred from the corresponding tRNA to a growing peptide strain.</p>

                <p>The Fisher Exact Test indicated proteins, which are more abundant in the cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> exposed to UVC/vacuum, belonging to the TCA-cycle. Nearly all key enzymes of the TCA cycle are more abundant in the cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> exposed to UVC/vacuum conditions. Citrate synthase, which is responsible for the condensation of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate to form citrate and CoA-SH as well as aconitate hydratase, which isomerize citrate into isocitrate and isocitrate dehydrogenase, which is allosterically activated by high ADP concentrations and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (both subunits) are significantly more abundant in the irradiated cells too. Apart from succinate-CoA ligase (hydrolyse of succinyl-CoA into succinate and CoA), all other key enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase for the oxidation of succinate into fumarate, fumarate hydratase, which catalyzes the trans addition of water to produce malate and malate dehydrogenase which oxidizes malate to oxaloacetate) were found in a significantly (p-value below 0.05) higher abundance in the cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> exposed to UVC/vacuum conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>
                <p>Apart from enzymes directly involved into the TCA cycle, all four proteins involved in the pathway that generates pyruvate from D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate were more abundant in the cells exposed to UVC/vacuum. Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 which contributes to the transformation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA for the first step in the TCA cycle was as well upregulated in the UVC/vacuum exposed <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can be obtained from sugars or as a by-product in the tryptophan metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Several proteins of the tryptophan metabolism were significantly upregulated in the UVC/vacuum exposed cells.</p>
                <p>Daly [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported a higher manganese to iron ratio in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> compared to other bacteria. Manganese contributes to the resistance against various extreme environmental conditions through the formation of ROS scavenging complexes with orthophosphate and peptides [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. After application of these complexes, a mouse model showed increased survivability after exposure to ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, manganese was proposed to influence glucose incorporation into the DNA after UV exposure [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It was shown that glucose is solely metabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway, which augments the DNA excision repair system as it provides adequate metabolites for DNA mismatch repair [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, mutants which lack important pentose phosphate pathway genes, as glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (<italic>zwf</italic>) are more sensitive to conditions that induce DNA excision repair, such as UV irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our data supports the assumption that <italic>zwf</italic> might participate in stress response, as it was significantly more abundant in the UVC/vacuum treated cells, which experienced DNA damage.</p>
                <p>As there are many upregulated proteins which are directly or indirectly connected to the energy metabolism it can be assumed that more energy for regeneration is required for the UVC/vacuum exposed cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> compared to the control cells. Joshi, Schmid [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] observed a degradation and resynthesis of several proteins after ionizing irradiation. The high abundance of various aminoacyl ligases in the irradiated cells indicates that the resynthesis most likely occur after the exposure to UVC/vacuum as well. The attachment of an amino acid to its tRNA which is catalyzed by these enzymes, is an energy demanding reaction which consumes one ATP per amino acid. At the same time the free amino acid pool in the UVC/vacuum exposed cells is lower than in the control cells also suggesting that protein resynthesis is a highly abundant process during recovery of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The increased energy demand of the irradiated cells is also necessary to cope with the nucleic acid damage which is triggered by upregulation of a number of ribonucleases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

                <p><italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> wild type strain is approximately 25 times more resistant to UVC irradiation than <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> wild type [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Early experiments with the mutagen N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine revealed mutant strains of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> which are more sensitive to UVC irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In 1994, Gutman, Carroll [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] confirmed a lower resistance to UVC in the <italic>recA</italic> and the <italic>polA</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] mutants. The IrrE mutant showed that the IrrE (also named <italic>pprI</italic>) gene function as a regulator for the expression of DNA repair and oxidative stress response proteins, like <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>pprA</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. <italic>pprA</italic>, which encodes a protein that can protect DNA ends from degradation and stimulate DNA-ligase activities, despite its function, seems to play a lesser role in UVC resistance, although it was upregulated in a previous UVC study [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Bauermeister, Bentchikou [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed in a comparison study that the UVC energy needed to kill 90% of a <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> culture was 1.5 times lower for the <italic>pprA</italic> mutant, 8 times lower for the <italic>irrE</italic> mutant and 20 times lower for the <italic>recA</italic> mutant compared to the wild type. In our proteomics analysis, <italic>polA</italic> (p-value 0.006) and <italic>pprA</italic> (p-value 0.027) were significantly more abundant in the irradiated cells, while <italic>recA</italic> and <italic>irrE</italic> levels showed no significant difference. Previous shotgun proteomic measurements of <italic>Deinococci spp</italic>. were primarily performed with a combination of two dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF after γ-irradiation. In a study conducted by Dedieu, Sahinovic [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] SSB, PprA, RecA, GyrA/B, UvrD, DdrB and DdrD showed upregulation after ionizing irradiation was applied on <italic>Deinococcus deserti</italic>. Another study [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] found only SSB and PprA among these proteins to be upregulated in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> after γ-irradiation. However, in a transcriptional approach, Tanaka, Earl [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed an upregulation of <italic>recA</italic>, <italic>gyrA/B</italic> and also for the DNA damage response genes <italic>ddrB</italic> and <italic>ddrD</italic> in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. In our experiment, a higher abundance of PprA, GyrA/B (both p-values 0.002), DdrB (p-value 0.022) and DdrD (p-value 1.7*10<sup>−4</sup>) was observed in irradiated cells, while RecA was present constitutively at high levels in both control and irradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). As our cells were incubated in TGB medium for 5 h after exposure, this fits to a kinetic study [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], which showed that RecA was upregulated for two hours after irradiation, but changed back to basal expression after four hours. Different proteomics/transcriptomics experiments showed some consistency in which DNA damage response proteins were upregulated [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Differences can be explained due to a number of variable experimental parameters, e.g., dose and type of irradiation, cells dried or in suspension and recovery time. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>, a lot of manually curated DNA damage response proteins were upregulated in our experiment, indicating that the severe DNA damage, which can be caused by UVC irradiation and desiccation stress, increases the synthesis rate of such proteins.</p>
                <p>Contrary to the well-characterized radiation-induced damage, the strategies by which cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> protect their DNA integrity in response to vacuum damage are poorly understood. Along with rapid dehydration of bacterial cells and changes in membrane permeability, DNA damage and mutagenesis have been previously described in microorganisms exposed to space vacuum [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>gyrA</italic> gene, coding for DNA gyrase subunit A has been reported to carry the majority of mutations induced by exposure of spores of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> to high and low vacuum [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. As suggested by our comparative proteomics analysis, GyrA protein (DR_1913) was upregulated (p-value 0.002) in UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> under vacuum conditions, which can be also potentially attributed to the influence of vacuum.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the exposure of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> to UVC/vacuum stress conditions triggered a suit of proteins involved in detoxification process and aimed to remove damaged nucleotides from the cell. The proteomics experiments revealed that UvrB, helixase subunit of the DNA excision repair endonuclease complex, was significantly more abundantly represented in cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> in conditions of UVC/vacuum stress. The upregulated UvrB binds to DNA, searches it for potential lesions and interacts with other proteins to repair them [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. MutT/nudix family protein (DR_0550) and MutS2 (DR_1976) involved in mismatch excision repair were upregulated in response to UVC/vacuum exposure. Some members of the Nudix family, such as MutT of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, limit mutations by hydrolyzing oxidized nucleotide metabolism products, which are mutagenic once misincorporated into the genome [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. MutS2 in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> is involved in ROS detoxification and the repair of ROS-induced DNA damage [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, induction of Mut and Nudix family members may be one of the important protective responses to UVC/vacuum stress. Expression of the proteins (recQ and ruvABC) involved in recombinational DNA repair was also significantly induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
                <p>The Mrr restriction system protein (DR_0508) that belongs to a yet unknown pathway showed high abundance (p-value 0.043) in UVC/vacuum exposed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Type IV restriction Mrr (methylated adenine recognition and restriction) endonucleases with specificity for methylated DNA have been reported to restrict DNA containing N6-methyladenine and also DNA with C5-methyl-cytosine residues [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Contrary to well-characterized Mcr restriction endonucleases, the physiological role of Mrr like nucleases in the cell has been less clarified. Recently, the Mrr restriction system was shown to implement into the peculiar piezophysiology of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Mrr endonuclease activity was linked to cellular filamentation and prophage induction in response to sub-lethal high-pressure shock in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K12 [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Hence, the observed up-regulation of Mrr restriction protein in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> under the influence of UVC/vacuum conditions might assign a novel role for this less studied protein in response to space-related stress stimulus.</p>

                <title>Molecular systems of stress response</title>
                <p>Our comparative proteomic analysis revealed a number of differentially abundant proteins in UVC/vacuum exposed cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> that belong to the functional machinery of general stress response and oxidative stress response. Proteins of general stress response function to protect and repair damage to cellular structures, such as DNA, the cell envelope and proteins, and to provide microorganisms the ability to recuperate from the stress they experience. Overexpression of a number of chaperons occurred in UVC/vacuum exposed cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. Heat shock protein that belongs to HSP20 family (DR_1114) and chaperonins hslO (DR_0985) and groL (DR_0607), which are involved in various metabolic processes and responsible for protein folding, were upregulated in UVC/vacuum exposed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Chaperone proteins ClpB (Q9RVI3), DnaJ (Q9RUG2) and DnaK Q9RY23 were as well more abundantly represented in UVC/vacuum exposed cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). By binding to proteins, which are misfolded and damaged in response to various environmental stresses, these molecular chaperones can direct the misfolded proteins to the associated proteases for degradation. The elevated level of several proteases (Lon proteases Q9RXG4 and Q9RSZ5 and ATP-dependent Clp protease ClpA (DR_0588)) in irradiated cells indicates the involvement of quality monitoring and proteolytic regulation in response to combined UVC/vacuum stress.</p>
                <p>Comparative proteomics analysis revealed a number of universal reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers, e.g., catalase, and redox active proteins (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate synthase, peroxidase, sulfoxide reductase MsrA, thioredoxin reductase) induced in cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> exposed to UVC radiation under vacuum conditions, manifesting the upregulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms in response to these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The extreme resistance of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> against radiation and oxidative damage relies on the high levels of constitutive catalase activity and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These enzymatic systems are devoted to the protection of cells against toxic reactive oxygen species. Out of three known catalases (DR1998, DRA0146, and DRA0259) in genome of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>, our data show the elevated levels of two of them: catalase katA (p-value 1.1*10<sup>−6</sup>) and predicted protein with catalase function DR_A0146 (p-value 4.3*10<sup>−4</sup>) in UVC/vacuum exposed <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The sodA protein was constitutively represented in both irradiated and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>). UVC irradiation under vacuum caused 2-fold elevated expression of the pyridoxine biosynthesis proteins PdxS and PdxT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>) which are singlet oxygen resistance proteins involved in the synthesis of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an efficient singlet oxygen quencher and a potential antioxidant [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The upregulated upon UVC/vacuum-irradiation thioredoxin reductase/alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (DR_1982) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>) is encoded by the gene <italic>trxB/ahpF</italic>, which is a key determinant of thiol redox sensing antioxidant enzymatic system in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>.

A putative iron-dependent peroxidase (DRA_0145), enzyme that may implement in defense against oxidative stress by providing protection against toxic hydroperoxides [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], was also among upregulated proteins in response to UVC/vacuum stress. This unique putative peroxidase has very few orthologs among bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and is listed among predicted systems of protection against oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>
                <p>Among significantly upregulated proteins in response to UVC/vacuum irradiation was also the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase MsrA (DR_1849) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>) that shares similarity with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>’s methionine sulfoxide reductase and performs repair of oxidized proteins reducing protein-bound methionine sulfoxide back to methionine via a thioredoxin-recycling process [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Reduction of oxidized methionine residues in proteins is essential mechanism for cells survival under oxidative stress [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and loss of MsrA sensitizes <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to hydrogen peroxide [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The induction of the gene <italic>msrA</italic> has been reported after ionizing irradiation of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (DR_0217), a rhodanese superfamily enzyme was as well more abundantly represented in exposed cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. Proteins containing a single rhodanese-like domain are generally considered to mediate different forms of stress response [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The level of thiosulfate sulfurtransferase has been earlier reported as significantly increased after ionizing irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
                <p>Oxidative stress-responsive proteins within tellurium resistance operon TerB (DR2220) and TerD (DR2221) were upregulated in cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> exposed to UVC/vacuum conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The homologous tellurium resistance proteins contribute to the resistance of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to various damaging agents, such as heavy metal ions and UVC radiation, and to the maintenance of the intracellular reducing environment, possibly by directly reversing disulfide bonds [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several reports suggest oxidative stress as major determinant of tellurite toxicity in tellurite sensitive organisms, including <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The genes encoding tellurium resistance have been specifically upregulated in a-proteobacterium <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> followed by space exposure at ISS in frames of MELiSSA project, as well as significant differentially expressed under the conditions of modeled microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The genes encoding TerB and TerE tellurium resistance proteins in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> were shown to respond to acute ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Moreover, the genes encoding TerB and TerZ proteins were found to be upregulated immediately after gamma-irradiation of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while tellurium resistance proteins TerB and TerD were also alleviated during gamma radiation in another study [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], implementing an adaptation to oxidative stress. Apart from tellurium resistance proteins, putative copper resistance protein (DR_A0299) with the predicted function of response to stress stimulus was found more abundant in UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Such an observed involvement of tellurium resistance elements in the response to radiation or factors related to space environment may be part of a metal sensing stress response system, as well as inner membrane oxidative stress response.</p>
                <p>The red-pigmented <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> encodes a set of genes involved in biosynthesis of carotenoids [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Carotenoid pigments have also been shown to contribute in protection against oxidative stress damage. Our comparative proteomic data analysis shows that phytoene desaturase (DR_0861), enzyme of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>, was more abundantly represented (p-value 0.043) in UVC-vacuum stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The arrest of lycopene synthesis and the accumulation of phytoene along with enhanced sensitivity to acute ionizing radiation and oxygen stress have been reported to the colorless DR0861 gene knockout strain, while complementation of the mutant with a heterologous or homologous gene restored pigmentation and resistance [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Increased abundance of phytoene desaturase in UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> indicates the contribution of the carotenoid synthesis pathway to the radioresistance and oxidative stress tolerance of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>.</p>
                <p>Other upregulated enzymes with a possible role in oxidative stress response were probable manganese-dependent inorganic pyrophosphatase ppaC (DR_2576) involved in oxidative phosphorylation and FrnE dithiol-disulfide isomerase (DR_0659) that catalyzes formation of protein disulfide bonds and is involved in sulfur metabolism. FrnE was induced in response to ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This thioredoxin fold protein is included in predicted radiation and desiccation resistance regulon of <italic>Deinococci</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p>

                <title>Transcriptional regulators</title>
                <p>A number of transcriptional regulators and repressors have been identified in our proteomic analysis as constitutively expressed in both UVC-irradiated under vacuum conditions and control cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. The expression level of transcriptional regulators and repressors of TetR, MerR, GntR and AsnC families remained unaltered in irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>, being constitutively represented under the control and UVC/vacuum conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). The transcriptional regulator of FNR/CRP family (DR_0997) was significantly more abundantly represented in cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> after UVC radiation under vacuum conditions. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) repressor proteins (CRP) act as global transcriptional regulators involved in many cellular pathways in various bacteria, including adaptation to starvation and extreme conditions [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The genome of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> encodes four predicted CRP family proteins, including DR_0997, DR_1646, DR_2362, and DR_0834 (64). Recently, the gene encoding DR_0997 was shown to regulate stress response of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> on the transcriptional level and loss of the Dr_0997 gene sensitized <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, and mitomycin C [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Interestingly, our comparative proteomic analysis showed the upregulation of DR_0997 along with the upregulation of several proteins, encoded by genes, which belong to CRP regulon [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> under UVC-vacuum combined stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Among them are Lon proteases (DR_0349 and DR_1974), DNA repair protein PprA (DR_A0346), UvrABC system protein B UvrB (DR_2275), catalase katA (DR_0146) and tellurium resistance protein TerB (DR_2220). Thus, DR_0997 might act as a positive regulator in response to combined UVC-vacuum stress in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>.</p>
                <p>DdrO, a transcriptional regulator of HTH_3 family (DR_2574) was 2.6-fold downregulated in UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> under vacuum conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Acting as a transcriptional repressor of Radiation Desiccation Response (RDR), DdrO binds 17 bp palindromic sequence called Radiation Desiccation Response Motif (RDRM) in 21 RDRM-promoters of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and represses a variety of DNA Damage Response (DDR) genes. We have also found that a number of RDR proteins comprising DdrO regulon were upregulated in UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> under vacuum conditions. Among them are DNA gyrase B subunit GyrB (DR_0906), Tkt transketolase (DR_2256), RecQ helicase (DR_1289), UvrD superfamily I helicase (DR1775), urocanate hydratase (DRA0151) and FrnE uncharacterized DsbA-like thioredoxin fold protein (DR_0659) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0189381.s003">S2 Table</xref>). Apparently, DdrO as a global master regulator serves to control reprogramming of microbial physiology in order to permit the adaptation of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> to combined UVC-vacuum stress.</p>

                <title>Metabolic regulation</title>
                <p>Our approach focuses on the identification and quantification of polar, primary metabolites. These are involved in growth, development and reproduction—parameters which are affected by UVC/vacuum stress. The metabolite analysis showed a significantly reduced abundance of overwhelming majority of identified polar metabolites in the irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g006">Fig 6</xref>). As <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> is a bacterium with a proteolytic life-style, it uses amino acids as preferred carbon source [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Ethanolamine was one of the very few metabolites, which were more abundant in the UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Splitting ethanolamine into ammonia and acetaldehyde can serve as a cellular supply of reduced nitrogen as well as a precursor for acetyl CoA [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], sustaining the necessary levels of these compounds in irradiated cells. Interestingly, the elevated level of a palmitoyl-derivative of carnitine was observed in the UVC-vacuum exposed cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Apart from its nutritional function, a quaternary amine compound carnitine has various physiological effects. As a compatible solute, carnitine is important osmoprotectant, and can also enhance thermotolerance, cryotolerance and barotolerance, impacting bacterial survival in extreme conditions [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. At the same time, osmotic stress has been described as a part of stress response which microorganisms experience exposed to the outer space environment or to its individual simulated factors [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] In this context, the observed upregulation of O-Palmytoyl-L-Carnitine chloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g006">Fig 6</xref>) may suggest the role of this quaternary amine compound responsible for adaptation to extreme conditions [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] in the protection of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> against combined stress conditions of UVC and vacuum. Moreover, carnitine as a compatible solute might be potentially necessary to overcome damaging desiccation effects of vacuum [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] by binding additional water molecules, helping to stabilize proteins and cell membranes, and thus preventing complete desiccation of the cell.</p>
                <p>The amount of octadecanoic (stearic) acid, which has been described as a minor component of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], was significantly increased in vacuum/UVC-irradiated cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The surface-active compound stearic acid was identified in biosurfactants of several bacterial species [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0189381.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Decreased levels of stearic acid associated with the dramatic reduction in biofilm formation of <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis nox</italic> mutant [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], suggesting its involvement in stress-related reactions. Stearic acid can potentially be involved in covering the cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> by a layer less permeable to water, thereby preserving the structural integrity of cell membranes in conditions of vacuum-induced dehydration. Although the cells of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> do not naturally produce stearic acid in big quantities under non-stressed conditions [<xref rid="pone.0189381.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], the observed accumulation of this biofilm-associated compound may potentially lead to the high survival of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> in dry multilayers under UVC/vacuum combined stress.</p>
                <p>Our study shows that response to UVC/vacuum combined stress and the enzymatic repair caused by the damage after ionizing radiation have overlapping molecular components in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic>. The combination of proteomic with metabolomic analysis of cells after UVC-irradiation under vacuum condition reveals that the response is a multilayer process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189381.g008">Fig 8</xref>).
