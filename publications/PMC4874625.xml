              <abstract>
                <p>During orbital or interplanetary space flights, astronauts are exposed to cosmic radiations and microgravity. However, most earth-based studies on the potential health risks of space conditions have investigated the effects of these two conditions separately. This study aimed at assessing the combined effect of radiation exposure and microgravity on neuronal morphology and survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. In particular, we investigated the effects of simulated microgravity after acute (X-rays) or during chronic (Californium-252) exposure to ionizing radiation using mouse mature neuron cultures. Acute exposure to low (0.1 Gy) doses of X-rays caused a delay in neurite outgrowth and a reduction in soma size, while only the high dose impaired neuronal survival. Of interest, the strongest effect on neuronal morphology and survival was evident in cells exposed to microgravity and in particular in cells exposed to both microgravity and radiation. Removal of neurons from simulated microgravity for a period of 24 h was not sufficient to recover neurite length, whereas the soma size showed a clear re-adaptation to normal ground conditions. Genome-wide gene expression analysis confirmed a modulation of genes involved in neurite extension, cell survival and synaptic communication, suggesting that these changes might be responsible for the observed morphological effects. In general, the observed synergistic changes in neuronal network integrity and cell survival induced by simulated space conditions might help to better evaluate the astronaut's health risks and underline the importance of investigating the central nervous system and long-term cognition during and after a space flight.</p>

              <p>Cosmic radiations and microgravity, combined with heavy workload, confinement and psychological stress, are the main stressors that affect the astronaut's health during space flight. The continuous free fall condition aboard the International Space Station (ISS) or spacecrafts orbiting earth, known as microgravity, induces physiological and metabolic changes in the human body as well as at the cellular level [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Cosmic radiations are a heterogeneous pool of ionizing radiations (protons, α-particles and HZE particles) with a wide range of charges and energies [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], mainly produced by galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Dosimetry performed with TLD-100 dosimeters of 19 astronauts aboard the ISS for about 180 days allowed to determine a total dose of 28.9±4.9 mGy and a dose of 71.9±12 mSv as prediction of the effective dose [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These analysis allowed to estimate the average dose rate of cosmic radiation, being in the order of 0.4 mSv or 0.16 mGy per day [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], while during a travel to Mars an equivalent dose rate of about 1.8 mSv per day (0.48 mGy with QF 3.82) has been estimated [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, secondary neutrons that originate from the interaction of primary particles with the spacecraft shield are thought to contribute to the overall radiation exposure [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Like microgravity, chronic exposure to space radiation can also induce a range of physiological defects [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p>
              <p>Neuroplasticity is an ability of the adult brain to remodel the network by contracting and re-extending neurites and to reorganize connections between neurons in response to environmental changes [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The neurite outgrowth motility involves several cytoskeletal proteins, in particular stable microtubules along the extensions, actin and integrins at the periphery of the outgrowth cone [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is relevant to mention that simulated microgravity alters morphology, cytoskeletal organization and cellular motility in <italic>in vitro</italic> primary neurons [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] as well as related cytoskeleton protein expression in rat hypothalamus [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and mouse hippocampus and hypothalamus [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, analysis of brain sections of rodents exposed to real or simulated microgravity highlighted changes in proteins involved in oxidative stress, Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, response to environmental stresses, neurotransmitter turnover, neurotransmitter release, glucose metabolism and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nowadays, many uncertainties still exist about space radiation risks to the central nervous system (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Investigations on neurons exposed to ionizing radiation have reported effects on spine number and synapse clusters after 14 days of high dose exposure [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], as well as neuronal cell death of maturing neurons after exposure to low doses (0.2 Gy) of X-rays [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicated that low and high doses of HZE particles, such as Fe and Ar, are capable of producing morphological, neurochemical and behavioral alterations, including apoptosis, oxidative stress, cognitive dysfunction, neurogenesis inhibition and memory impairment [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], while a correlation could be observed between neurodegenerative diseases and heavy ion exposure in a mouse model [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover, mice acutely irradiated with O and Ti charged particles showed cognitive decrement, persistent reduction in dendritic arborization and spine density, and altered synaptic integrity 6 weeks after exposure [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, neurological disorders such as mental fatigability, reduced learning ability and increase of irritability have been reported in populations exposed to chronic low dose of ionizing radiation [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although consequences of exposure to either microgravity or irradiation are well documented, only few experiments have been performed combining both conditions. For example, a decreased apoptosis could be demonstrated in fetal fibroblasts cultured for 24 h under simulated microgravity after exposure to moderate (0.5 Gy) and high (1 Gy) doses of X-rays [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, a delay in DNA repair kinetics accompanied by an increased apoptosis was observed in peripheral lymphocytes exposed to simulated gravity and high doses of gamma irradiation, as compared to cells that were only exposed to irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Interestingly, in mouse fetal fibroblasts exposed to simulated microgravity and chronic radiation (neutron source), a gene expression analysis concomitantly revealed changes in genes related to cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell motility, oxidative stress, cell signaling and the cell cycle [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous effect of both space conditions on nervous system functionality and remodeling has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the combined effect of microgravity and irradiation (acute X-ray and chronic neutron exposure) on <italic>in vitro</italic> well-connected primary mouse cortical neurons, in order to better comprehend the consequences of space conditions to the central nervous system through neuronal network evaluation. Conscious about limitations of 2D <italic>in vitro</italic> neuron cultures used as an adult CNS model, we previously investigated neuronal connectivity in our <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures as a hallmark of an adult neuronal network. This showed that in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model, the stage of reasonable connectivity [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was reached at about the 10<sup>th</sup> day of culture (10<sup>th</sup> day <italic>in vitro</italic>, DIV) [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. At this stage, mature neurons are characterized by spontaneous burst activity, inhibitory activity of GABA and glycine neurotransmitters [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and increased resistance to exogenous stressors (compounds, environmental factors and infections) [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. To beter undestend adult brain mechanisms, this in vitro 2D model has been largely accepted by the scientific community and used to investigate well-connected and mature neuronal physiology [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. By using a combined approach of histological and transcriptomic analyses, we revealed a modified neuronal morphology and network integrity, accompanied by elevated apoptosis levels after exposure to simulated microgravity and/or irradiation, which is indicative of CNS risks posed to the astronaut during space flight missions.</p>

                <title>Primary Neural Cultures and the Neuronal Network Model</title>
                <p>Primary neural cultures were initiated from the brain cortex of 17 day-old mouse fetuses as described in [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine coated 4-well plates or 12.5 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (Thermo Scientific, Aalst, Belgium) at a density of 50,000 cells per cm<sup>2</sup>, and were cultured for 10 days to obtain a dense neuronal network. After five days of culture, 2/3 of the medium was replaced by fresh medium every two days until simulated space condition exposure. All animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre (SCK•CEN, Mol, Belgium) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO, Geel, Belgium) joint Ethical Committee on Laboratory Animal Experiments (Permit number: 08–001). All required efforts were made to minimize suffering.</p>
                <p>To study morphology, viability and gene expression changes, all 4-well plates (54 for acute irradiation or 24 for chronic irradiation) were filled with complete neurobasal medium at day 9 of culture (9<sup>th</sup> DIV) and sealed with sterile parafilm. At 10 DIV, three replicates for each condition were mounted on a desktop RPM (Dutch Space) [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] to simulate microgravity. At this stage, the purity of neuron cultures is higher than 90%. This results was estimated by immunofluorescence analysis on βIII-tubulin positive cells and DAPI staining.</p>

                <p>In the acute exposure experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), 10 DIV neural cultures were first irradiated with X-rays, followed by simulated microgravity exposure. Cell cultures were irradiated at room temperature with 250 kV-15 mA, 1 mm Cu-filtered X-rays (Pentak HF420 RX machine), delivered at 5 mGy/sec. The Farmer 2570-EMI dosimeter was under the control of the Intercomparison Committee for Dosimetry. Cells were either non-exposed, exposed to a low dose of 0.1 Gy, or exposed to a high dose of 1.0 Gy of X-rays. Immediately after irradiation, half of the samples were placed on the RPM for simulated microgravity and the other half was kept in ground conditions as controls, both at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Samples were analyses after 0.5 h, 2 h, 6 h or 24 h of simulated microgravity. Three replicates were used for each experimental condition.</p>

We used Californium-252 as source of neutrons and 2% of primary and secondary γ-rays, obtaining a final dose rate of 0.2 mGy/d to simulate space radiation [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

                <p>Twenty-five mosaic regions of 2 by 2 images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti (automated inverted wide-field epifluorescence microscope) equipped with a 40x magnification (40x / 0.75) dry objective and a Nikon DS-Qi1Mc camera controlled by NIS-Elements software. Post-acquisition, images were compressed in a 2D in focus image by the Extended Depth of Focus (EDF) NIS-Elements module [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
                <p>The neuronal network image processing analyses were performed using the MorphoNeuroNet, a home-made tool for ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., N.I.H, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

                <title>Apoptosis Measurements</title>
                <p>To quantitatively estimate the percentage of cell death, an Annexin V (Ann V)—propidium iodide (PI) assay was applied on adherent neurons using the Ann V-FITC apoptosis detection kit II (eBioscience, BMS500FI/300CE, Belgium), combined with Hoechst fluorescent staining to visualize all nuclei. The AnnV-FITC<sup>-</sup>/PI<sup>-</sup>/Hoechst<sup>+</sup> (AnnV<sup>-</sup>-PI<sup>-</sup>) population was considered as normal healthy cells, while the AnnV-FITC<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>-</sup>/Hoechst<sup>+</sup> (AnnV<sup>+</sup>-PI<sup>-</sup>) and Ann V-FITC<sup>+</sup>/PI<sup>+</sup>/Hoechst<sup>+</sup> (AnnV<sup>+</sup>-PI<sup>+</sup>) cells were considered early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic, respectively. Non-neuronal cells with small nuclei and condensed chromatin, usually negative for βIII-tubulin, were not considered for analysis. Twenty-five images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti using a 20x objective and 500±150 cells per condition were taken into account.</p>
                <p>Cell death was also determined by analyzing the degree of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, being a characteristic of apoptotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Nuclear fragmentation was defined by a high fluorescence intensity (&gt;50% of saturated nuclear pixels) within a single nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

                <title>Neuronal Morphology Is Affected by Acute X-ray Exposure and Simulated Microgravity</title>
                <p>To assess morphological consequences of simulated microgravity and acute X-ray irradiation on well-connected neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, we determined the average neurite length and area as well as the soma area on βIII-tubulin stained neurons.</p>
                <p>While control cells showed a significant neurite outgrowth over the 24-h period, neurite outgrowth was completely arrested in irradiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Contrarily, in irradiated neurons co-subjected to simulated microgravity, a retraction of the neurites was noted within 2 h, with no further outgrowth within 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Similar results were found for the average neurite area (data not shown). Thus, in general, a more pronounced retraction of neurites was observed under microgravity as compared to ground conditions at 2 h and 24 h. When analyzing the cell somata, a clear trend towards a reduced soma size was noted in irradiated neurons 0.5 h (0.1 Gy: p = 0.093, 1.0 Gy: p = 0.053) and 2 h (0.1 Gy: p = 0.021, 1.0 Gy: p = 0.085) as compared to non-irradiated neurons, which recovered after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Exposure to simulated microgravity resulted in an overall reduction in soma area as compared to ground conditions (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>), but combined exposure did not cause an additional reduction in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, while neurite length and soma size were differentially affected by our simulated space conditions, exposure to simulated microgravity had an enhanced negative effect on both parameters.</p>

Surprisingly, whereas we could identify 71 differential genes between 1 mGy and RPM exposed neurons, and 41 differential genes between 1 mGy and co-exposed neurons, chronic low dose radiation did not cause any changes in gene expression as compared to the control condition.

                <p>Our analysis revealed a very significant overlap of differentially expressed genes after exposure to RPM and exposure to combined conditions (390 genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). When considering these overlapping genes, we discovered the involvement in e.g. chemotaxis or synaptic transmission, thereby hinting towards changes in network remodelling after RPM exposure and combined chronic space simulation. To substantiate this, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis on this set of genes. With this, we could identify several significantly affected pathways involved in e.g. regulation of axon outgrowth and regulation of synaptic transmission (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6B</xref> for a non-exhaustive list). Furthermore, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 1394 genes differentially expressed in co-exposed neurons revealed that the majority of these genes (67%) were upregulated after the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Gene ontology enrichment of the small cluster of downregulated genes showed only a few gene sets to be involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, green bar), at first sight not related to the observed neuronal phenotype described before. Gene ontology enrichment of the upregulated genes, on the other hand, identified a number of related gene sets (see orange bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6D</xref> for a non-exhaustive list), including those involved in regulation of neuron apoptotic processes and synaptic transmission.</p>
                <p>To verify a reduced neurite length and a possibly altered neurite guidance or synaptic communication as was proposed from our gene expression analysis, we performed qRT-PCR experiments for genes involved in these pathways. This indeed showed an increase in the repulsive molecule <italic>Slit2</italic>, immediately after five days of combined exposure to chronic neutron irradiation and microgravity, as compared to ground control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Further, the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (<italic>Slc17a6</italic> or <italic>Vglut2</italic>), a regulator of excitatory glutamate availability, and the GABA receptor B2 (<italic>Gabrb2</italic>), an inhibitory postsynaptic GABA receptor, were significantly increased both after exposure to RPM as well as in co-exposed neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0155260.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>). This thus clearly indicates changes in synaptic transmission and communication in neurons subjected to simulated space conditions.</p>
                <p>In general, we were able to strengthen our morphological and gene expression data, and propose a negative effect of chronic RPM and combined RPM/irradiation exposure on neurite outgrowth, cell communication and cell survival in mature neuronal networks.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study we evaluated the effects of simulated space conditions, i.e. exposure to ionizing radiation combined with a simulation of weightlessness, on well-connected mature cortical neuron cultures. In first instance, neurons were subjected to acute X-irradiation followed by a 24 h period of simulated microgravity. Secondly, in order to better reproduce space conditions aboard the ISS, chronic exposure to Californium-252, a source of neutrons and γ-rays, was used over a five-day course (0.2 mGy/d approximates the maximal dose rate achievable during ISS missions) in combination with microgravity exposure. We then evaluated the effect of both simulated space conditions on neuronal morphology as well as on cell death events. In addition, earth re-adaptation was simulated by implementing a recovery period of 24 h, in order to analyze a potential recovery of neuronal morphology [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Finally, gene expression experiments were performed as a useful tool to discover the underlying molecules and pathways implicated in the histological observations.</p>
              <p>Morphological analyses of βIII tubulin-stained neurons revealed a strong neurite retraction particularly after RPM exposure and co-exposure to RPM and radiation, which was the case for both acute and chronic exposure paradigms. This observation corresponds well to previously published data showing a disturbed neuronal morphology of mature cultured neurons exposed for 1 h and 24 h to RPM conditions [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Notably, however, a long-term follow-up of these RPM-exposed neurons indicated an attenuation of the induced defects after 10 days of exposure, suggestive of cell adaptation to the new gravitational field [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and thus warranting a longer follow-up of co-exposed neurons in future set-ups. When considering acute exposure, in which low and high doses of radiation were administered acutely and neurons were monitored over time, we could show that irradiation alone merely resulted in stalling of neurite outgrowth for at least 24 h. This milder effect of irradiation as compared to RPM on neurite outgrowth was even more evident after chronic (co-)exposure, where we found no difference in neurite length and area in neurons solely exposed to irradiation for five consecutive days, whereas a strongly reduced neurite area and length was noted in RPM and co-exposed neurons. This clearly suggests a different effect of RPM and irradiation on neurite extension and thus on neuronal outgrowth. In this respect, it is important to note that gene expression analyses on chronically exposed neurons did not reveal any differentially expressed genes after chronic exposure to radiation, whereas many genes were differentially expressed in RPM and co-exposed neurons as opposed to non-exposed neurons. In all, the obvious morphological defects that occur after a change in gravitational field combined with exposure to ionizing radiation might be attributable to cytoskeletal changes, which can also be suggested from our gene expression data. This would be in line with other studies revealing cytoskeletal changes due to altered gravity, as shown by microfilament and microtubule changes [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and possibly related to a cell surface reduction [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>The observed reduction in neurite outgrowth in neurons exposed to microgravity and/or combined with irradiation might also imply an improper network formation and synaptic communication. Therefore, we analyzed gene expression profiles after a chronic exposure to radiation and/or RPM, with the purpose of identifying related gene sets. Interestingly, this unveiled changes in expression of genes related to synaptic transmission, chemotaxis and cellular organization, from which some were validated by RT-qPCR. Somewhat counterintuitively, we noted an increased expression of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic genes. A compensatory increase in neurotransmitter transport and neuron excitability after chronic exposure to stress stimuli might be at play, although this increased expression does not necessarily imply an improved signal transduction in the brain. For example, a compensatory upregulation of GABA receptors was detected in schizophrenic patients with reduced numbers of inhibitory neurons and was suggested to highly contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Further, an increased VGluT expression might be intrinsically linked to excitotoxic neurodegeneration and associated neuronal pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In light of these results, a closer look at synaptogenesis and possible degenerative events will be key to better understand neuronal communication and wiring in brains exposed to space conditions. In view of this, a recent study by Demertzi <italic>et al</italic>. discovered changes in brain connectivity, vestibular ataxia as well as changes in motor coordination in a cosmonaut during his mission aboard the International Space Station [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A defective brain wiring is further corroborated in mice exposed to HZE particles, in which an altered behavior, associated with changes in medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus connectivity, was detected. A concomitant decrease in dendritic arborization and dendritic spine density was observed in these animals, which further establishes the functional deficit resulting from cosmic rays [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Notably, since changes in neuron morphology and synaptogenesis were particularly evident in neurons co-exposed to space conditions in our study, the results shown by Parihar et al. [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] might even be underestimated and should include a combined exposure to simulated microgravity to reveal the true impact on the CNS.</p>
              <p>Based on previous reports linking a defective synaptogenesis and synapse density to a reduced soma size [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], we next envisioned to analyze the soma area in our set-up. Exposure to simulated microgravity alone and in combination with acute or chronic irradiation indeed resulted in a fast reduction of the soma size already after 0.5 h, which persisted in chronically exposed neurons. This is in accordance with our previous results showing a decrease in the soma size after 1 h and 24 h of RPM exposure, and persisting until 10 days [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Surprisingly, whereas acute X-ray exposure had no influence on the soma size, chronic low-dose neutron radiation resulted in a reduced soma size. In keeping with the fact that synaptogenesis genes were not altered and neurite area and length were not affected in these chronically irradiated neurons, a closer look at the somata in these cells thus deems necessary to correctly interpret our finding. Nevertheless, our data imply that a short, acute, exposure to radiation might not be sufficient to induce differences in soma morphology, or that a difference in the chosen radiation paradigm might differently affect the cell body.</p>
              <p>In an attempt to simulate the recovery of exposed neurons to earth conditions after a space flight, we subjected neurons to ground conditions for 24 h and re-assessed neuronal morphology parameters. From this, a persistently aberrant neurite area and neurite length was unveiled, again especially apparent for RPM and co-exposed neurons. Of importance, this finding is in accordance with previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], showing a decrease in the neurite area and length during the first 24 h of ground recovery after RPM exposure, and showing a higher recovery potential of cell somata as compared to neurites. As such, this knowledge on early CNS events that occur after re-introduction to ground conditions are a good indicator of recovery potential, and can serve to further investigate long-lasting changes in neuronal morphology in astronauts that return from a space flight.</p>
              <p>Apart from neuronal morphology, we also assessed cell survival in neurons exposed to RPM and/or irradiation. Analogous to the neurite outgrowth profile, we showed an increased apoptosis in RPM and co-exposed neurons, either acutely or chronically, as compared to controls, whereas irradiation alone–at least for the low dose of 0.1 Gy–did not generally induce apoptosis. Intriguingly, the fact that we did not observe apoptosis after 2 h of RPM is in sharp contrast to previously obtained data in which RPM-induced apoptosis was already apparent after 1 h exposure [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This discrepancy might possibly be explained by a different analysis method, i.e. assessment of the percentage of fragmented nuclei in our current analysis <italic>vs</italic>. an AnnV-PI analysis in the former study. Since fragmented nuclei only account for late apoptotic cells, the increase in apoptosis within the first 24 h of RPM exposure might thus be underestimated in our study, which hinders a correct comparison between both studies. Yet, noteworthy, we distinguished between early and late apoptotic cells after a 5-day chronic exposure to weightlessness and neutron irradiation. From this, we showed a significant increase in early as well as late apoptotic cells in RPM and co-exposed neurons, while we could reveal a synergistic effect of combined space conditions on the amount of late apoptotic cells. A sound explanation for this synergistic elevation in late apoptotic cells is still lacking at the moment, but might be in accordance with a faster induction of the cell death pathway when cells are simultaneously exposed to both space conditions. Importantly, a gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between RPM/co-exposed neurons and non-exposed controls could further confirm a compromised cell survival, and showed their involvement in e.g. 'cellular response to stress' and 'regulation of cell death' after a five-day chronic exposure period.</p>
              <p>With regard to the effects of combined space conditions on cells or tissues (e.g. immune cells, germ cells or bone tissue), space life investigators proposed three different theories: additive [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155260.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], antithetical [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] or non-correlative [<xref rid="pone.0155260.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In this study, we unveiled an additive effect of the combined chronic treatment on both the neurite and soma area, whereas the neurite length as well as the number of late apoptotic neurons were shown to be synergistically affected. Thus, while the overall neuronal morphology is compromised after combined space conditions, neurite outgrowth and survival seem to be particularly prone to the space environment, raising concerns with respect to neuronal connectivity and communication in astronauts while aboard a space craft. In all, by taking into account both space conditions, we set the stage for future experiments using for example additional time points or <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches, which will undoubtedly lead to a more complete understanding of processes occurring within the central nervous system during an astronaut's space flight and during recovery back on earth.</p>
