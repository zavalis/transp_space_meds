                <p>14 day-old mouse ovarian tissue and preantral follicles isolated from same-aged mice were incubated in a simulated microgravity culture system. We quantitatively assessed follicle survival, measured follicle and oocyte diameters, and examined ultrastructure of the oocytes produced from the system. We observed decreased follicle survival, downregulation of expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and growth differentiation factor 9, as indicators for the development of granulosa cells and oocytes, respectively, and oocyte ultrastructural abnormalities under the simulated microgravity condition. The simulated microgravity experimental setup needs to be optimized to provide a model for investigation of the mechanisms involved in the oocyte/follicle <italic>in vitro</italic> development.</p>

              <p><italic>In vitro</italic> ovarian follicle development and oocyte maturation have been achieved using traditional methods for 2-dimensional culture, such as on the surface of petri dishes, and three dimensional (3D) matrix, such as alginate and hydrogel<xref rid="B0" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. A 3D culture system effectively maintained follicles in a tissue-like structure and kept the similar gene expression profiles as <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> follicles, and produced meiotically competent oocytes<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. 3D culture systems can also be established in a matrix-free condition, for example, hanging drop suspension and rolling vessels. The rotating wall vessel (RWV) developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) generates a simulated microgravity (s-µ<italic>g</italic>) for the cells cultured inside the vessel<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. This simulated microgravity condition provides a unique culture system for cell proliferation and differentiation because of the lack of sedimentation for convection. It has been shown that simulated microgravity promoted endothelial vessel formation from endothelial cells<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, thyroid tissue assembling from thyroid cells<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, and chondrogenesis from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in RWV devices<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. However, other studies have shown that simulated microgravity induced apoptosis in gastric cells and B lymphoblasts<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, suggesting the effects of simulated microgravity on cellular injury may be cell type-dependent. Simulated microgravity could also cause changes at the ultrastructural level, as reported in the disturbed spindle organization and induced cytoplasmic blebbing in oocytes<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The optimized simulated microgravity conditions and mechanisms that induce tissue engineering or cellular injuries under the system require further investigation. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments of growing ovarian follicles/oocytes using RWV devices can provide valuable information on oocyte gene expressions and ultrastructures of oocyte organelles. In this study, ovarian tissue containing preantral follicles and isolated preantral follicles was used to investigate the effects of simulated microgravity<italic>on follicle development and oocyte maturation.</italic></p>
              <p>In this study, ovarian tissue containing preantral follicles and isolated preantral follicles were used to investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on follicle development and oocyte maturation. In our study, the RWV, a simulated microgravity device, spins around a horizontal axis inside a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, providing a simulated microgravity condition with efficient oxygenation and very low shear stress. We analyzed the gene expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9) as indicators for the development of granulosa cells and oocytes, respectively. We demonstrated that PCNA and GDF-9 expressions were suppressed in the granulosa cells and oocytes, respectively, when cultured in the RWV device, and we showed the withdrawal of oocyte microvilli from the zona pellucida in the follicles cultured under the s-µ<italic>g</italic> condition, which was similar to that in GDF-9-deficient mouse follicles<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>.</p>

              <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a RWV with oil inside the vessel. A droplet of 150 µL medium containing one piece of ovarian tissue or three alginate beads with encapsulated follicles was put into the oil. The medium droplet was kept in a state of terminal velocity due to the fluid drag on the droplets within the rotating oil at rate of 25 rotations per minute, which generated a simulated microgravity (s-µ<italic>g</italic>) condition. In a control experiment, ovarian tissue or capsulated follicles were cultured in a droplet of 150 µL medium covered with mineral oil in 35×10mm dishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which generated a 1-<italic>g</italic> condition.</p>
              <p>To study the effects of simulated microgravity on preantral follicle development<italic> in vitro</italic>, we cultured the 14 day-old mouse ovarian tissue under 1-<italic>g</italic> (control experiment) or s-µg conditions. We counted the number of healthy follicles in the H&amp;E stained sections in two conditions after 0, 2, and 4 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that the follicle survival in ovarian tissue treated in the s-µ<italic>g </italic>condition was significantly lower than that under the 1-<italic>g</italic> condition at day 2 and day 4 of culturing (<italic>p </italic>&lt;0.05, ANOVA). Moreover, we found that no PCNA positive signals were detected in the ovarian tissue under the s-µ<italic>g</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In the culture of isolated preantral follicles encapsulated in alginate beads, we revealed that significantly more follicles survived under 1-<italic>g</italic> condition (76.8% ± 5.3%, n = 227) than s-µ<italic>g</italic> condition (54.4% ± 6.7%, n = 249) on day 4 of culturing. In addition, oocyte size had no significant increase after 4 days of culturing, though the follicle size increased significantly under both gravity conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). However, follicles with less than 10% dead granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) were significantly lower under the 1-<italic>g</italic> condition (81.5 ± 5%, n = 10) than under s-µ<italic>g</italic> condition (90 ± 8%, n = 10) (<italic>p </italic>&lt;0.05).</p>
              <p>To investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on oocyte functionality, we examined the expression of the oocyte-specific marker GDF-9. We demonstrated that GDF-9 expression was remarkably down-regulated in the ovarian tissue under s-µ<italic>g</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated frequent ultrastructural abnormalities of oocyte organelles in the encapsulated follicles at day 4 of culture under the s-µ<italic>g </italic>condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The critical steps for successful culturing of preantral follicles are: 1) correctly selecting the preantral follicles according to the selection criteria that were described in Protocol Text 2.1); 2) preforming all procedures in a skeptical condition and maintaining a sterile culture; and 3) correctly setting up the RWV culture system.</p>
              <p>The safeguarding of consistency of experimental observations in the replicate experiments is to use similar or identical materials. The criteria for the selection of mouse preantral follicles revealed that the follicles had 1) healthy oocytes at the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) stage surrounded by a thin zona pellucida; 2) 2-3 layers of granulosa cells enclosed by a basal membrane; and 3) some thecal cells attached to the basal membrane. Thus, the follicles selected had not only all three functional compartments of an ovarian follicle for supporting oocyte growth, but also a similar morphological identification with a diameter of 90 - 100 µm.</p>
              <p>This is the first attempt to grow mouse preantral follicles in the manner of 3D culturing under the simulated microgravity. Several culture systems have been developed for mouse preantral follicles. Oocytes obtained from the follicle cultured on a flat surface of petri dishes, the so-called 2D culture, could be fertilized and produced live offspring. Moreover, 3D cultures, such as cultures of follicles in alginate beads, maintain a tissue structure similar to what the body produces in high percentage meiotically competent oocytes. However, the development process of ovarian follicles/oocytes in a zero-gravity field is unknown. RWV, a device which is attracting substantial attention in tissue engineering, can generate a simulated microgravity environment and provide an ideal environment for investigating the effects of simulated microgravity on the ovarian follicle/oocytes growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
              <p>It is important to set up the RWV apparatus properly for cell culture. The air bubbles in the vessel must be removed. The method to remove air bubbles, if generated in the vessel, is as follows: Place two syringes with 0.5 mL of oil in each of the two syringe ports. Open the valves controlling the syringe ports. Maneuver air bubbles underneath the syringe port. Pull the bubbles into the syringe while injecting approximately the same volume of media through the other syringe port. After all bubbles are removed, close the valves, remove the syringes, and replace the syringe port caps. It is also critical to find out the correct rotation speed, which prevents cells from settling via a constant rotation. Optimization of the rotation speed is determined by the specific weight of the cells, the fluid density, and the viscosity.</p>
              <p>The expression profiles of PCNA and GDF-9, which were similar to those in GDF-9-deficient mouse follicles<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, revealed that simulated microgravity had detrimental effects on the development of granulosa cells and oocytes. The vessel of the RWV device spun around a horizontal axis inside a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, allowing for permeation of oxygen and carbon dioxide across a membrane in the back, providing efficient oxygenation and very low shear stress, which was unlikely to be the cause of follicle/oocyte injury. Optimization of the experimental setup and further analyses are needed to investigate the mechanism of the detrimental effects.</p>
              <p>Further studies are needed to investigate the developmental potential of the <italic>in vitro</italic> oocytes derived from the RWV culture system. <italic>In vitro</italic> maturation of oocytes to MII stage is presently being carried out. The final validation of this culture system will be examined by the fertilization capacity of the retrieved oocytes.</p>
