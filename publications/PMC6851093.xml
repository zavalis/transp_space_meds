                <p id="Par1">The overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that +Gz (hypergravity/positive acceleration) and microgravity can both aggravate intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). Due to <bold>+</bold>Gz and microgravity, many pilots develop IVDD. However, the lack of animal models of IVDD under conditions of simulated <bold>+</bold>Gz and microgravity has hampered research on the onset and prevention of IVDD. Rabbits were randomly allotted to a control group, microgravity group, <bold>+</bold>Gz group, or mixed (<bold>+</bold>Gz + microgravity) group. A tail-suspension model was utilized to simulate a microgravity environment and an animal centrifuge to mimic <bold>+</bold>Gz conditions. After exposure to the above conditions for 4, 8, and 24 weeks, the body weights (BW) of animals in the control group gradually increased over time, while those of animals in the microgravity and mixed groups both decreased (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). As compared with the control group, the proteoglycan content of animals in the other three groups was significantly reduced (F = 192.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The imageological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical changes to the L6–S1 intervertebral disc samples suggests that the effects of <bold>+</bold>Gz and microgravity can aggravate IVDD over time. The mixed effects of <bold>+</bold>Gz and microgravity had the greatest effect on degeneration and <bold>+</bold>Gz had a particularly greater effect than microgravity.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Everyone can experience gravitational forces when riding in an elevator, roller coaster, etc. The influence of microgravity and hypergravity on living systems, such as neuronal, thyroid, and tendon cells, has attracted significant attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Gravity influences physical and biological processes and plays a critical role during the development and homeostasis of human tissues. The rate of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is approximately quadrupled among pilots and astronauts following spaceflight because of exposure to the specific environmental conditions of microgravity and hypergravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. A survey by Rabin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> of 722 pilots and astronauts employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration found that 384 (53%) had low back pain. Analysis conducted by the Japanese Aeronautical Laboratory of 260 pilots found that 12.3% had IVDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Dagenais <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> analyzed 147 studies conducted in different countries from 1997 to 2007 and found that low back pain caused by IVDD was a major drain on financial and medical resources.</p>
              <p id="Par3">IVDD onset is characterized by a reduction in the number of disc cells and decreased ability to bind water due to proteoglycan (PG) decomposition in the nucleus pulposus (NP). Meanwhile, the layered structure of the annulus fibrosus (AF) begins to deteriorate, resulting in the development of internal fissures that spread around the periphery of the AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Collagen-1, which is mainly present in the AF, while collagen-2 is mainly present in the NP, forms a small loose fibrous network associated with PG that maintains the stability and strength of the NP matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Under normal physiological conditions, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a protective factor that inhibits the degradation of collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix, promotes the repair of intervertebral disc (IVD) tissue, and even reverses degeneration of the NP and AF.

At weeks 4 and 8, observation by light microscopy indicated that most NPs were complete and had a clear boundary with the AF, while NP cells were evenly distributed and loose reticular fibers formed throughout the extracellular matrix. At week 24, a few tissue sections in the control group showed partial absence of NPs and formation of cell clusters, while the inner layer of the AF was slightly distorted. Furthermore, internal fissures were observed with the occasional appearance of rounded chondrocytes in the NPs of animals in the microgravity group. There were fewer and scattered NP cells in sections obtained from animals in the +Gz and mixed groups, accompanied with metaplasia of chondrocytes. The number of NP cells was significantly reduced and fissures existed between the inner and outer layers (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par11">Using a centrifuge and tail-suspension model designed for rabbit studies, the effects of +Gz and microgravity on IVDD were systematically explored. Given that acquiring and maintaining rats and rabbits is easier and more affordable than that of other animals, recent studies of IVDD have mostly used the rat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, the rabbit is much larger than the rat, with morphologic characteristics that are more similar to those of humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par12">Analysis of the changes in BW of the experimental animals found that weight loss was mainly caused by severe restriction of physical activities induced by tail-suspension, while the animals’ resistance led to more physical compression, and the posture of the head downward and feet upward had harmful effects on digestion and absorption of food, as well as breathing and circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par13">The normal NP and the medial side of the AF in the IVDs had high signal intensities on sagittal T2WIs, and with the development of IVDD, the water content of the NP was reduced, which resulted in weakening of the signal intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In combination with the Pfirrmann’s grading system showed no significant short-term degeneration in the lumbar IVDs. In the long-term (24 weeks), IVDD was occasionally observed. Similarly, several rabbits in the microgravity group were graded as level II at 24 weeks due to the effect of microgravity. Although +Gz alone and in combination with microgravity can accelerate degeneration in the early stage (4 weeks), with an increase in exposure time, disc degeneration becomes more obvious. It is worth mentioning that the assessment of disc degeneration in the early stage was not observed by MRI, but was only confirmed by histological examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. As IVDD is initiated by histomorphological and molecular changes, only when the degeneration achieved a certain degree, imageological changes can be depicted. Besides, pathological performance at the micro level is easier to detect early, while imageological examinations are macroscopic.</p>
              <p id="Par14">The healthy NP is rich in PG and collagen-2, whereas the AF is rich in collagen-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Collagen-1 and collagen-2 are the most abundant collagens in discs, accounting for about 70%–80% of all collagen. Previous studies suggest that members of the TGF-β family have pleiotropic effects on IVD cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Yang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> found that the TGF-β content was significantly increased in degenerative disc disease. Jin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> revealed that TGF-β was a protective factor of NP and AF, regulated collagen-1 and collagen-2, and inhibited or even reversed the process of IVDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The present experiment showed the contents of collagen-1, collagen-2, and TGF-β did not change significantly with no intervention, and there was no significant degeneration of the NP and AF in the control group, while under the conditions of +Gz and/or microgravity, the contents of collagen-1 and TGF-β gradually increased and that of collagen-2 decreased with an increase in exposure time. Meanwhile, the degeneration of NP and AF were positively correlated with exposure time.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Humans retained notochordal cells in ageing discs, the number is very low. In comparison, rabbit discs have a high number of notochordal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. It was shown that notochord cells can effectively maintain the size of the NP and prevent disc degeneration, which was often caused by the disappearance of notochord cells in animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Our experiment showed that the cell phenotype had changed in the central region of NP, which probably resulted from the phenotype changes of notochordal cells, or caused by the growth of fibrocartilaginous tissue from cartilage endplate. These changes reduced the hydration ability of intervertebral disc and the resistance to degeneration, which can be considered as the initial changes of IVDD.</p>
              <p id="Par16">What determines the mechanisms by which +Gz and/or microgravity induces disc degeneration? The substance and energy metabolism of IVDs is maintained by osmosis because of the lack of a direct nutrient supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Many scholars have acknowledged that this nutrient delivery method is required by the vertebrae to bear loads and to maintain normal hydrostatic pressure between the vertebrae, thereby further ensuring the distribution of body fluids and blood, as well as normal metabolism among the discs and vertebrae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Under conditions of +Gz or/and microgravity, IVDs and vertebrae had to bear loads that were much greater than physical hydrostatic pressure, resulting in weakened permeability of cartilage and endplates, and subsequent dramatic reductions in the nutrient supply and metabolism of NP and AF, especially oxygen and glucose supplies, thereby reducing the synthesis and concentration of PG in the NP, causing dehydration and atrophy of the IVD tissue, and hindering the repair and reconstruction of NP and AF, ultimately accelerating the progression of IVDD. Besides, it has been confirmed that with the changes of pressure and stress on the IVD, interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor, MMPs, and other serum inflammatory factors can mediate and accelerate the process of IVDD, and their expression is regulated by a series of signal channels, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, nuclear factor-κB pathway, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">In conclusion, the conditions of simulated +Gz and microgravity can be widely applied to studies of the causes and prevention of IVDD. The results of this study suggest that the mixed effects of +Gz and microgravity were more obvious than the single impact of +Gz or microgravity alone, which could accelerate IVDD. Besides, the degree of degeneration was positively correlated with exposure time. Further neurologic function testing should include other spinal segments and consider secondary injuries.</p>

The +Gz environment was induced by centrifugation of a custom-made mesh rotating box with a 1.6-m arm (YL-001; Apos Optoelectronic Corp., Changchun, China) at 79.1 rpm to obtain + 7 Gz.

The results of the present study showed that after exposure to +7 Gz three times for 60 s each with 10-min intervals, the performance of the rabbits was generally normal.

Due to the shorter tail and average size of New Zealand white rabbits, the rabbits were suspended by the tail and hind legs.

IVD samples of L6–L7 and L7–S1 were obtained with a sharp scalpel, then fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and stored at room temperature. The reason for collecting IVD samples from L6–L7 and L7–S1 was to obtain samples subjected to the largest load, as changes at these locations were the most obvious. According to a report by Phillips <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, the caudal vertebrae (L7–S1) usually sustained a greater load than the proximal vertebral segments (L7–S1 &gt; L6–7 &gt; L5–6 &gt; L4–5). Therefore, IVD samples from L6–L7 and L7–S1 were selected for key observations and evaluations of the range of interest.</p>

                <title>Biochemical study</title>
                <p id="Par25">At 24 weeks, IVD samples from L6–L7, together with the adjacent AF and surrounding soft tissue, were resected and fixed in 20% formalin for the determination of PG content. In a preliminary experiment, PG content was slightly reduced with no statistical significance at 4 and 8 weeks; however, levels were significantly attenuated at 12 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. After degreasing, 10 mg of NP were added to 0.05 mL of 3% NaOH in a 4-mL centrifuge tube, which was incubated at 40 °C in a water bath using a constant temperature vibrator for 3 h. Then, 2 mL of glacial acetic acid and 50 μL of 0.25% trypsin was added to the tube, which was further incubated at 50 °C in a water bath for 2 h. The enzyme mixture was transferred to a flask and divided into 10-mL aliquots. One milliliter of this solution was used for PG analysis according to the phloroglucinol method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Absorbance of the reaction mixture was detected using a spectrophotometer (UV-2201; Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at a wavelength of 558 nm, then transformed into PG content.</p>

                <title>Histopathological study</title>
                <p id="Par26">The IVD samples of L7–S1 collected from each subgroup were subjected to standard dehydration in baths of increasing percentages of alcohol, cleared in dimethylbenzene, embedded in paraffin, frozen for 20 min, and then serially sectioned into 5 µm-thick slices. The samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), as well as safranin O by routine methods, and observed under a light microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The cellularity and morphology of NP and AF were evaluated according to the Nishimura classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and all images were examined by another experienced histologist in a blinded manner. Safranin O binds to PG, so a stronger red staining with indicates a higher amount of PG, from which the concentration of PG can be determined to study the degeneration of NP cells.</p>

                <title>Immunohistochemical study</title>
                <p id="Par27">Each paraffin-embedded section was deparaffinized, dehydrated, and then boiled under high pressure and temperature in 0.01 mol/L sodium citrate for 3 min. Next, the sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were then incubated with the primary antibody (anti-collagen-1, 1:100, no. 2035; anti-collagen-2, 1:100, no. 2036; anti-TGF-β, 1:200, no. 2042; anti-MMP-1, 1:100, no. 2038; anti-MMP-3, 1:100, no. 2040, Bosheng Corp., Beijing, China) for 60 min at 37 °C. Then, the sections were incubated with an appropriate mouse-anti-goat secondary antibody (Dako Corp., Copenhagen, Denmark) at 37 °C for 20 min and colored with diaminobenzidine reagent (Dako Corp.). Finally, the immunohistochemical sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and observed under a light microscope. Images were saved using Image-Pro Plus software, version 7.0 (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). The mean grey values were used as indicators of the positive expression of collagen-1, collagen-2, and TGF-β, and the positive-expression rate were utilized as indicators of positively-stained MMPs. Visual fields of each image were randomly selected for further analysis.</p>

                <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                <p id="Par28">All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of differences between all variables among the four groups. A least-significant difference post-hoc test was used to identify differences among groups. A probability (<italic>p</italic>) value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
