              <p id="Par3">On Earth, microorganisms play prominent roles in natural processes such as the weathering of rocks into soils and the cycling of elements in the biosphere. Microorganisms are also used in diverse industrial and manufacturing processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, for example in the process called biomining (or bioleaching)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Microorganisms can catalyse the extraction of valuable elements from rocks, such as copper and gold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This process can in some circumstances reduce the environmentally damaging use of toxic compounds such as cyanides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These microbial interactions with minerals are also used to decontaminate polluted soils, in a process called bioremediation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Acidophilic iron and sulfur-oxidisers are often used to biomine economic elements from sulfidic ores, but heterotrophic microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, can be effective in bioleaching in environments with circumneutral or alkaline pH. These organisms can enable leaching by changing the local pH in the environment, for example by the release of protons or organic acids. Alternatively, leaching and sequestration of elements can occur as a consequence of the release of complexing compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Of important economic and practical interest are rare earth elements (REEs), which include the lanthanides, scandium and yttrium. On account of their physical properties, including ferromagnetism and luminescence, REEs are used in electronic devices such as cell phones and computer screens, as well as in catalysis, metal alloy and magnet production, and many other high-technology applications. Some REEs are identified as short-term near-critical elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, meaning that the demand will soon outstrip supply. Microorganisms are known to be able to mobilise REEs. For example, REEs are used as a cofactor in alcohol dehydrogenases in diverse microbial taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and they were shown to be essential for the survival of an acidophilic methanotroph in a volcanic mudpot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The ability of microorganisms to mobilise REEs from rocks has been shown for a variety of different mineral matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">As humans explore and potentially settle in space, microbe–mineral interactions have been recognised to be important, including in biomining<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition to mining beyond the Earth, advancing our understanding of microbe–mineral interactions in space could be applied to: (1) soil formation from nutrient-poor rocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, (2) formation of biocrusts to control dust and surface material in enclosed pressurised spaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, (3) use of regolith as feedstock within microbial segments of life support systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, (4) use of regolith and microbes in microbial fuel cells (biofuel)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, (5) biological production of mineral construction materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. All of these diverse applications have in common that they require experimental investigations on how microbes attach to, and interact with, rock and regolith materials in space environments. Furthermore, there is a need to know how organisms alter ion leaching and mineral degradation in altered gravity regimens, which will occur in any extraterrestrial location.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Altered gravity conditions, such as microgravity, are known to influence microbial growth and metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Although the capacity of prokaryotes to directly sense gravity remains a point of discussion, gravity influences sedimentation and convection in bulk fluids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. By allowing for thermal convection and sedimentation, gravity is thought to affect the mixing of nutrients and waste, thereby influencing microbial growth and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Based on these considerations, we hypothesised that altered gravity regimens would induce changes in microbial interactions with minerals, and thus bioleaching.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this work, we present the results of the European Space Agency BioRock experiment, performed on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2019 to investigate the leaching of elements from basalt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, an analogue for much of the regolith material on the Moon and Mars, by three species of heterotrophic microorganisms. The experiment compared bioleaching at three different levels of gravity: microgravity, simulated Mars and terrestrial gravity. Results are reported on the bioleaching of REEs, demonstrating the effective use of microorganisms in biomining beyond Earth using a miniaturised space biomining reactor.</p>

                <p id="Par23">The pH status is an important factor in the efficacy of biomining. NOTOXhisto fixative lowers the final pH of the solutions, so that the pH at the end of the experiment is not representative of the pH during growth. In all experimental solutions, the final pH ranged between 4.16 ± 0.20 and 6.12 ± 0.01 (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par24">As it was not possible to measure the pH during the experiment on the ISS, a ground experiment was conducted to investigate pH changes over the 21 days of growth at 20–22 °C. Results are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The pH remained circumneutral for the non-biological samples throughout the experiment with slight differences in the presence of basalt. The presence of bacteria caused the pH to rise during the 21 days compared to the negative controls, regardless of the specific species. At day 21, the pH values for the three cultures in the presence of basalt were: <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic>, 8.41 ± 0.01; <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 8.63 ± 0.01; <italic>C. metallidurans</italic>, 8.66 ± 0.01, and the non-biological control 7.35 ± 0.036 (mean ± sd). The presence of the basalt slide caused slight pH differences within the biological samples during the first week of growth. After one week, the pH remained constant until the end of the experiment for all the microorganisms. After 21 days of growth, the pH values with and without the presence of the rock are similar for each microorganism, suggesting that the influence of the rock material on the pH values stabilised over time (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). There was a large drop in pH after the addition of the fixative (<italic>S. desiccabilis</italic>, 3.58 ± 0.07; <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 3.89 ± 0.10; <italic>C. metallidurans</italic>, 3.76 ± 0.08, and the non-biological control 3.08 ± 0.03, mean ± sd). The post-fixative pH values are different depending on the organism, but independent of the presence of the basalt. After one week of cold storage, the presence of the basalt slide caused an increase in pH for all biotic and non-biological samples, indicating that the pH measured in the flight and ground control samples was influenced by both the presence of the basalt slide and the fixative.</p>

              <p id="Par25">This study investigated the use of microorganisms to extract a group of economically important elements (fourteen REEs) from basalt rock, a material found on the Moon and Mars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, under simulated Mars and Earth gravity on the International Space Station (ISS). Microgravity was investigated as the lowest gravity level possible to explore the effects of a lack of sedimentation on bioleaching, to understand the role of gravity in influencing microbe–mineral interactions in general, and to gain insights into industrial biomining on asteroids and other very low gravity planetary objects. A true Earth gravity ground control experiment was also performed.</p>
              <p id="Par26">The presence of the bacterium <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic> was found to enhance mean concentrations of leached REEs in all gravity conditions investigated and these enhancements were significant in simulated Mars and Earth gravity on ISS compared to the non-biological controls. Although the <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic> microgravity samples reached higher mean concentrations than the microgravity non-biological controls for all REEs, the difference was not statistically significant. The statistical result is interpreted to be caused by the greater standard deviations in the leached concentrations of elements in the microgravity biological experiment and non-biological controls and the loss of one of the microgravity control samples owing to contamination, rather than an effect of microgravity on biological leaching.</p>
              <p id="Par27">The lack of a significant difference in the final concentrations of REEs leached by <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic> when the different gravity conditions were compared is surprising since microgravity has been reported to influence microbial processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, the results are consistent with our observation that final cell concentrations did not differ between the different gravity conditions in the three microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. One reason for the lack of statistically significant differences in final concentrations of REEs between gravity conditions might be that the bacterial cultures had sufficient nutrients to reach their maximum cell concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, regardless of the different sedimentation rates in each gravity, thus achieving similar leaching concentrations. Hence, the experiments showed that, with the appropriate nutrients, biomining is in principle achievable under a wide range of gravity conditions.</p>
              <p id="Par28">The mechanism for the REE bioleaching in <italic>Sphingomonas desiccabilis</italic> is unknown. It was not caused by bulk acidification of the growth medium, since the ground experiments showed that the medium had a slightly basic pH profile during the experiment. The microorganism is a prolific producer of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) and these compounds are known to enhance bioleaching in other organisms by complexing ions in EPS moieties such as uronic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. A greater biological enhancement in the leaching of heavy compared to light REEs was observed, a pattern consistent with observations by Takahashi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> in laboratory cell cultures and natural microbial biofilms. The authors suggested that phosphate moieties on the cell or EPS might preferentially bind heavy REEs, a distinct property of these biologically produced materials. We also note that the authors suggested that heavy REE enrichments could potentially be used as a biosignature for the activities of life. Beyond applications to biomining, our experiments showed the preferential enhancement of heavy REEs in the liquid phase including in simulated Martian gravity, indicating the production of a potential biosignature under altered gravity, with implications for example for additional methods to test the hypothesis of life on Mars.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Enhanced REEs associated with pelleted <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic> cells compared to the other two species was not observed. The reduced pH caused during fixation and sample preparation may have unbound any REEs attached to cell surfaces in all three species. Alternatively, the majority of the REEs may have bound to the extracellular EPS or have been released directly into solution. We have observed <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic> by confocal microscopy to form biofilms on the surfaces and at the edges of cavities on the basalt more pervasively than <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>C. metallidurans</italic> under these growth conditions, which could have enhanced cell-mineral interactions and thus leaching of REEs into solution. The analysis of REEs within biofilms did not form part of this study since we wished to separately examine the biofilms non-destructively.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Unavoidable in this experiment was the potential for continued leaching after fixation and during storage, when the pH was reduced in the chamber. However, during storage, the temperature was kept at 2.1 °C on the ISS and below 7.1 °C during sample return to reduce leaching activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Furthermore, a similar reduction of the pH occurred in the non-biological control samples.</p>
              <p id="Par31">In contrast to <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> demonstrated less mean leaching in the biological experiments than the non-biological controls in all three gravity conditions. This cannot be attributed to cells attached to the rock retarding ion release since the microorganisms did not form substantial biofilms on the surface of the rock and the final cell biomass was lower than in the case of <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. As the pH was likely to be similar to the other organisms during the course of the experiment as shown by our ground-based post-flight pH experiment, differences in pH during the experimental phase cannot explain the results. An alternative explanation could be a chemical effect of cell exudates, such as ligands that retarded leaching or the solubility of REEs. However, despite its previously demonstrated bioleaching activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, and cell wall absorption of REEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, Kucuker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> showed that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was not able to extract tantalum, a transition metal considered similar to a REE, from capacitors.</p>
              <p id="Par32"><italic>C. metallidurans</italic> did not enhance leaching of REEs. In a 3-month preparatory phase for the BioRock experiments, the leaching of elements from crushed basalt by this organism on the Russian FOTON-M4 capsule was investigated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In this experiment, <italic>C. metallidurans</italic> enhanced copper ion release, but other rock elements did not show significantly enhanced leaching. Although the microorganism was suspended in mineral water, the results are consistent with those reported here.</p>
              <p id="Par33">In none of the experiments was a cerium anomaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> observed. Unlike other REEs that are all trivalent, cerium can be oxidised to the less soluble Ce<sup>4+</sup> state, which can cause differences in precipitation and concentration compared to other REEs. The experiments were performed under oxic conditions. However, once the cerium was leached from the rock, its oxidation state would not necessarily have changed its presence in the bulk fluid, potentially explaining the lack of an anomaly.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Comparing the Earth gravity simulation on the ISS with the ground-based experiments (true 1 × <italic>g</italic> control), no significant difference was observed between biological experiments with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>C. metallidurans</italic>, but there was a significant difference between the <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic> biological experiments and between the non-biological controls, with ground-based leaching significantly less in some REEs compared to the Earth gravity simulation on the ISS. Simulated gravity in space is not exactly the same as 1 × <italic>g</italic> on Earth as shear forces induced by centrifugation in space can create different physical conditions. Furthermore, because of the small radius of the centrifuge rotor in KUBIK, gravity forces vary across the culture chamber. We also note that the ground experiment had a 0.46 °C higher temperature offset than the KUBIKs on the ISS during the main experimental phase. The experiment on the ISS involves the launch and download to Earth of the samples, which could influence them in ways that cannot be easily predicted. Nevertheless, the general trends observed in Earth gravity experiments with respect to biologically enhanced leaching for the three organisms were conserved in space.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Our experiment has several differences with any proposed large-scale biomining activity. The basalt rock was not crushed in order to investigate biofilm formation on a flat, contiguous but porous rock surface, another main goal of the BioRock experiment. This may have influenced the total percentage of REEs extracted from the rock, which was generally less than 5 × 10<sup>−2</sup> %. These leaching rates would likely be higher with crushed rocks, which on Earth have been shown to result in leaching efficiencies of REEs of 8.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup>% to several tens of percent under optimised conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we did not stir our reactors as we wanted to investigate the effects of microgravity and Mars gravity on cell growth in the absence of artificial mixing. Understanding which parameters would require adjustments to enhance the process as well as upscaling of the reactor would be the next step. Our experiment demonstrates that the leaching capacities of the three different microorganisms on the Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> were similar in space. Thus, Earth-based ground experiments provide reliable insights into the biomining capacities of specific organisms in space. Yet, our experiments also confirm that it is important to be careful in the selection of microorganisms for space biomining operations.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Basaltic material was investigated because it is common on the Moon and Mars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Our experiment suggests that other materials could return even higher yields. For example, lunar KREEP rocks have unusually high concentrations of REEs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. We did not test lunar gravity (0.16 × <italic>g</italic>) directly, but it lies between microgravity and Mars gravity. Our results therefore likely reflect the potential efficacy of biomining operations under lunar gravity. We suggest the construction of REE biomining facilities in the Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Imbrium regions of the Moon, where KREEP rocks are abundant. The principle we demonstrate could be applied to other materials of economic importance for <italic>In-Situ</italic> Resource Utilisation (ISRU). For example, meteoritic material has been shown to be compatible with microbial growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup> and thus our microgravity experiments show the potential for biomining in low gravity asteroid environments.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In conclusion, our results demonstrate the biological mining of economically important elements in space, specifically REEs and in different extraterrestrial gravity environments. The experiments also demonstrate the novel REE bioleaching ability for the mesophilic, biofilm-forming, and desiccation-resistant bacterium <italic>S. desiccabilis</italic>, which could be used in biomining applications. From a technical point of view, our experiment also demonstrated the principles of a miniature space biomining reactor. The experiment thus shows the efficacy of microbe–mineral interactions for advancing the establishment of a self-sustaining permanent human presence beyond the Earth and the technical means to do that.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Three bacterial species were used to investigate bioleaching. Criteria were: (1) they could tolerate desiccation required for experiment preparation, (2) they could grow on solid surfaces and/or form biofilms, (3) they were able to interact with rock surfaces and/or bioleach, and (4) they all could be grown in an identical medium at the same experimental conditions to allow for comparisons between organisms.</p>

The material was an olivine basalt rock collected near Gufunes, Reykjavik in Iceland (64°08′22.18′′N, 21°47′21.27′′W) chosen because it has a chemical composition similar to that of basalts found on the Moon and Mars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The rock was cut into slides of 1.5 cm × 1.6 cm and 3 mm thick. The mass of 15 of these slides was 1.871 ± 0.062 g (mean ± standard deviation). The rock was not crushed, as might be carried out for large-scale bioleaching, because the BioRock project was also concerned with quantifying the formation of microbial biofilms over a contiguous mineral surface.</p>

                <p id="Par48">Single strain cultures of each organism were desiccated on the slides as follows:</p>
                <p id="Par49"><italic>S. desiccabilis</italic>. An overnight culture of the strain was grown in R2A 100% at 20–22 °C until reaching stationary phase (OD600 = 0.88 ± 0.09; approximately 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units per mL). Then, 1 mL of the culture was inoculated on each basalt slide and the samples were air-dried at room temperature (≈20–25 °C) with a sterile procedure within a laminar flow-hood.</p>
                <p id="Par50"><italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Spores were produced as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>.

                <p id="Par51"><italic>C. metallidurans</italic>. Samples were prepared using a freeze-dry protocol (Belgian Co-ordinated Collection of Microorganisms, BCCM). Cells were cultured on solid Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA, Oxoid CM0131, BCCM) medium.

Thirty millilitres of bacterial suspension were transferred to a 90 mm petri dish and basalt slides were submerged in the bacterial suspension and gently shaken overnight. Basalt slides, each containing approximately 10<sup>9</sup> colony forming units per mL, were then transferred to a 6-well plate (1 slide per well) and covered with a gas permeable seal and inserted on a pre-cooled shelf of −50 °C, followed by a freezing phase for 90 min at a shelf temperature of −50 °C. Primary drying was performed with a shelf temperature of −18 °C and chamber pressure of 400 mTorr. A secondary drying was performed with a shelf temperature of 20 °C and a chamber pressure below 10 mTorr. After freeze-drying, the 6-well plate was covered with a lid and wrapped in parafilm.</p>

                <title>Flight experimental setup</title>
                <p id="Par54">The hardware design, assembly and filling procedure were described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Each Experiment Unit (EU) of the BioRock apparatus was designed to accommodate two independent basalt slides in two independent sample chambers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each EU contained culture medium and fixative reservoirs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). To allow oxygen diffusion without contaminating the cultures, each chamber was equipped with a deformable, gas permeable, silicone membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. After integration of the basalt slides, the medium and fixative reservoirs were filled with 5 mL of medium and 1 mL of fixative for each sample, respectively. The culture chambers and surrounding ducts were purged with ultrapure sterile N<sub>2</sub> gas.</p>
                <p id="Par55">All the samples were integrated under strict aseptic procedures into the EUs. There were 36 samples in 18 EUs for the flight experiment, and 12 samples in 6 EUs for the ground experiment. The EUs were integrated into a secondary container that provided the required two-level containment of the fixative (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The EU within the container is referred to as the Experiment Container (EC).</p>
                <p id="Par56">After integration, 18 flight ECs were stored at room temperature (≈20–25 °C) for 2 days. The ECs were launched to the ISS on board of a Space X Dragon capsule, Falcon-9 rocket during CRS-18 (Commercial Resupply Services) mission on July 25, 2019 from the NASA Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida. On arrival at the ISS, ECs were stored on-board at 2.1 °C.</p>
                <p id="Par57">On the day of the start of the experiment (July 30, 2019), the ECs were installed by astronaut Luca Parmitano into two KUBIK facility incubators, pre-conditioned to a temperature of 20 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Medium injection was performed robotically, triggered by internal clocks built within the ECs, powered by electricity provided by the KUBIK incubator. Thereafter the astronaut removed the ECs and took photographs of all culture chambers to obtain evidence of the medium supply and to allow comparison with the same chamber after the experimental growth period. After image acquisition, the ECs were plugged back into the KUBIKs. Two KUBIK incubators were used for BioRock, running in parallel: One was set to simulate Earth gravity (1 × <italic>g</italic> = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) at the surface of the basalt slide where bioleaching is occurring, while the second was set to simulate Mars gravity (0.4 × <italic>g</italic> = 3.71 m/s<sup>2</sup>; Mars gravity is strictly 0.38 × <italic>g</italic>, but finer <italic>g</italic> resolution is not possible to set in the KUBIK) at the surface of the basalt slide. Gravity levels were measured every 10 min during the active experimental phase using an accelerometer (ADXL313, Analog Devices) mounted on a printed circuit board fixed to the bottom of the EC. The distance between the top face of the basalt slide and the plane of the top face of the PCB was 10.3 mm. A correction factor was applied to account for the longer rotation radius at the basalt slide. These accelerometer (gravity) values are shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>. The microgravity-exposed ECs were split equally between both KUBIKs and inserted in the static slots available in the facility. The experiment was run for 21 days.</p>
                <p id="Par58">To stop the cultures from growing, the fixative was automatically injected into the culture chambers on August 20, 2019. The samples were removed from the KUBIK incubators and images of the culture chambers were taken. Afterwards, the ECs were stored in refrigeration as described below.</p>

                <p id="Par59">The temperature of the ECs from pre-flight until post-flight was measured using temperature loggers (Signatrol SL52T sensors, Signatrol, UK) on the rear of four of the ECs. These data showed that temperatures did not exceed 7.1 °C from pre-flight handover until storage after arrival at the ISS. During on-board storage, both before and after the 21-day period of culturing, temperatures were constant at 2.1 °C. During culturing, the loggers recorded a temperature of 20.16 °C in both KUBIKs. The ECs were downloaded from the ISS, packed in a ‘double coldbag’ provided by NASA. Splashdown occurred in the Pacific Ocean on August 27 and handover of the ECs to the investigators occurred on August 29 at Long Beach Airport, LA, USA. Between removal from storage on August 26 on ISS and handover to the science team on August 29, the temperature loggers recorded a temperature of 6.6 °C, rising transiently to 7.1 °C. The ECs were stored in a refrigerated insulated box and transferred to the NASA Ames Research Centre for sample removal on August 30.</p>

                <p id="Par60">Parallel to the experiment occurring on the ISS, a 1 × <italic>g</italic> ground experiment (true Earth gravity) was run to compare with the ISS simulated Earth gravity samples. Six ECs for the ground experiment were shipped from the NASA Kennedy Space Center to the NASA Ames Research Centre under cooled (4 °C) conditions. The six ECs were attached to a power system (KUBIK Interface simulation station, KISS) with leads running from the system into a 20 °C laboratory incubator (Percival E30BHO incubator). The ground reference experiment commenced 2 days after the start of the space experiment and the procedure for the space experiment was replicated: medium injection, first image acquisition, 21-day experiment, fixation, second image acquisition, and cold storage at 4 °C. The temperatures of the ECs measured by temperature logger (see above) on two of the ECs were 3.58 and 4.54 °C during shipment to NASA Ames. During the 21 days main experimental phase, the loggers recorded a temperature of 20.62 °C. During post-experiment storage, the temperature was 3.06 °C.</p>

From the total of 6 mL of total bulk fluid per EC, an aliquot of 3 mL was taken and 65% nitric acid was added to a final concentration 4% to fix ions and minimise attachment and loss to container walls. These samples were cold stored at 4 °C until further analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par62">Fixative injection was successful for all the space ECs.

                <p id="Par65">Upon return to Edinburgh, UK, the 3 mL of acid-fixed sample was prepared in the following way: each sample was sequentially (in three batches) spun down in a 1.5 mL tube at 10,000 × <italic>g</italic> (IEC MicroCL 17 centrifuge, Thermo Scientific) for ten minutes to pellet cells and cell debris. The supernatant was collected into a 15 mL tube and analysed by ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry). Acquired liquids were used to determine the bulk fluid REE concentrations. Cell debris pellets were washed two times in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and this discarded liquid was pooled. Nitric acid was added to the pooled fluid to a final concentration of 4%, and the samples were analysed by ICP-MS. This liquid was used to determine the REE concentrations that were washed off the cell matter. The pellet was transferred to an acid-washed glass serum bottle pre-baked at 450 °C in an oven (Carbolite Type 301, UK) for 4 h to remove organic molecules. The vial with the pellet was heated at 450 °C for a further 4 h to volatilise carbon and leave residual ions. After cooling, 1.5 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O were added with nitric acid to a final concentration of 4% and samples were analysed by ICP-MS. This liquid was used to determine the REE concentrations associated with the cell material.</p>
                <p id="Par66">ICP-MS analysis was carried out as described below on the R2A 50%, NOTOXhisto and ddH<sub>2</sub>O. It was not possible to examine the separated cryoprotectant for <italic>C. metallidurans</italic>. However, as a significance enhancement in the biological experiments compared to the controls for this organism was not observed, we infer that the protectant did not add additional REEs.</p>
                <p id="Par67">All samples were analysed by ICP-MS using an Agilent 7500ce (with octopole reaction system), employing an RF (radio-frequency) forward power of 1540 W and reflected power of 1 W, with argon gas flows of 0.81 L/min and 0.20 L/min for carrier and makeup flows, respectively. Sample solutions were taken up into the micro mist nebuliser by peristaltic pump at a rate of approximately 1.2 mL/min. Skimmer and sample cones were made of nickel.</p>
                <p id="Par68">The instrument was operated in spectrum multi-tune acquisition mode and three replicate runs per sample were employed.

The REE Pm (promethium) was not measured as the element is radioactive and no standard was available.</p>
                <p id="Par69">To calibrate the instrument, multi-element calibration standards containing each element were prepared using an REE multi-element standard (Multi-Element Calibration Standard-1, Agilent Technologies, USA) plus a Uranium single-element 1000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> standard (SPE Science, Canada) diluted with 2% v/v HNO<sub>3</sub> (Aristar grade, VWR International, United Kingdom). A NIST standard reference material, SRM1640a, was employed as a reference standard for some of the elements. The limits of detection for the REEs were split broadly into two groups: La, Ce, Pr, Tb, Ho, Tm, Lu: 0.0025-0.005 ppb. Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb: 0.001-0.005 ppb.</p>
                <p id="Par70">Raw ICP-MS data (determined in μg/L) was converted to obtain the absolute quantity of a given element in the culture chamber, taking into account dilution factors applied during ICP-MS analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par71">To determine REE concentrations in the basalt slide, between 25 and 50 mg of homogenised sample was added to Savillex Teflon vessels. Rock standards (basalt standards BIR-1, BE-N, BCR-2, BHVO-1) were prepared in the same way. Two blanks were included (<italic>i.e</italic>., sample without basalt). Three millilitres of double distilled HNO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mL HCl and 0.5 mL HF was added to each of the vessels. HF was added after the other acids to prevent disassociation, formation and precipitation of aluminium fluorides. Samples were placed on a hot plate for digestion overnight (temperature of 100–120 °C) and checked for complete digestion. Samples were evaporated on the hot plate. Five millilitres of 1 M HNO<sub>3</sub> was added to each vessel. Lids were added and the samples returned to the hot plate for a second digestion step. Samples were further diluted with 2–5% HNO<sub>3</sub> for ICP-MS analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par72">Analysis was carried out on a high resolution, sector field, ICP-MS (Nu AttoM). The ICP-MS measurements for REEs were performed in low resolution (300), in Deflector jump mode with a dwell time of 1 ms and 3 cycles of 500 sweeps. Data were reported in micrograms of REE per gram of basalt.</p>
