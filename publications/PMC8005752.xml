                <p>Four strains belonging to the family of <italic>Methylobacteriaceae</italic> were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as <italic>Methylorubrum rhodesianum</italic>. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was &lt;99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and &lt;97.3% for <italic>gyrB</italic> gene, with the closest being <italic>Methylobacterium indicum</italic> SE2.11<sup>T</sup>. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of <italic>M. indicum.</italic> The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were &lt;93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were &lt;46.4% with any described <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus <italic>Methylobacterium.</italic> The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> and <italic>M. terrae</italic> since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C<sub>18</sub><sub>:</sub><sub>1</sub>−ω7<italic>c</italic> and C<sub>18</sub><sub>:</sub><sub>1</sub>−ω6<italic>c</italic>. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>, and the name <italic>Methylobacterium ajmalii</italic> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> (NRRL B-65601<sup>T</sup> and LMG 32165<sup>T</sup>).</p>

              <p>The genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> contains more species than any other genera within the family <italic>Methylobacteriaceae</italic>, order <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>, and class <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species are Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria. The genus was first proposed by <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Patt et al. (1976)</xref> with <italic>Methylobacterium organophilum</italic> as the type species. The genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> was first emended to include facultative methylotrophs that have the ability to grow on methane or methanol as the source of carbon and energy, in addition to sugars and organic acids (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Patt et al., 1976</xref>). Another taxonomic study classified all other previously known pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria under the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Green and Bousfield, 1982</xref>). Thereafter, 11 species from the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> were redefined into a new genus proposed as <italic>Methylorubrum</italic>, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), genomic, and phenotypic data (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Green and Ardley, 2018</xref>).</p>
              <p>The genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> consists of 45 recognized species, which are ubiquitously present in a wide variety of habitats including air, soil, freshwater, and sediments, and can exist either in free-form or associated with plant tissues (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gallego et al.,2005a,b</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Veyisoglu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kwak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Green and Ardley, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Madhaiyan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kumar M. et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Parasuraman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Grossi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Krug et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, a novel <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> sp. 2A was observed to result in higher density of lateral roots in inoculated potato crops, even under salt stress conditions, compared with control plants that were not inoculated with the bacteria; it was also found to exhibit biocontrol activity against several plant pathogens (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Grossi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, genomic analysis of <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> sp. 2A revealed the presence of metabolic pathways involved in plant growth promotion, including the genes for producing an auxin, 3-indole acetic acid (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Grossi et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), four strains belonging to the family <italic>Methylobacteriaceae</italic> were isolated (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019</xref>). Some of the <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species that are phylogenetically related to these ISS strains have been isolated from plant sources (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that the ISS strains might also display properties related to plant growth promotion. The objectives of this study were to generate whole genome sequences (WGS) and define the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains using polyphasic taxonomic analyses. The WGS generated and annotated in this study was used to predict biotechnologically useful genetic determinants.</p>

Briefly, the polyester wipes used to collect samples and particulates associated with the sampling devices were transported to Earth before being disassociated into sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) solution and plated onto R2A agar medium (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Checinska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019</xref>). The microbial cultures that were grown at 25°C for 7 days were picked from the R2A plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Distinct colonies (<italic>n</italic> = 4) isolated from three different locations and from a high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter were characterized during this study. These colonies exhibited unique coloration and differential genomic phylogeny. The type strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> was isolated during Flight 1 (March 2015) at Location #7, the Overhead-3 panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic materials research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. The second strain, IIF1SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. The third strain, IIF4SW-B5, was isolated during Flight 2 (May 2015) at Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crewmembers also used the table for experimental work. The fourth strain was I1-R3, isolated from the ISS HEPA filter that was returned aboard STS-134/ULF6 in May 2011 and archived as reported earlier (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Checinska et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

                <p>A biomass of approximately 1 μg wet weight was collected for DNA extraction from each strain after growing on R2A medium at 25°C for 3 days. Total nucleic acid extraction was carried out using ZymoBIOMICS 96 MagBead DNA kit (lysis tubes) (Zymo Research, United States) after bead beating with a Bertin Precellys homogenizer. This was followed by library preparation using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol as per Illumina document number 1000000025416 v07. The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5 to 12 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in 384-plex configuration. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 platform with a paired-end module. The data were filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Patel and Jain, 2012</xref>) for high-quality (HQ) vector- and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20).

                <p>Due to higher sequence similarities of three ISS strains with <italic>M. indicum</italic> SE2.11<sup>T</sup> (99.4% for 16S rRNA gene and 97.3% for <italic>gyr</italic>B gene), the draft genomes of three ISS strains were subjected to ANI and dDDH analysis with other species belonging to family <italic>Methylobacteriaceae</italic> (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The ANI indices of three ISS strains (IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5) with <italic>M. indicum</italic> SE2.11<sup>T</sup> were 92.7 to 93%, and dDDH values were 45.8 to 46.4%. The ANI and dDDH values obtained for three ISS strains with other <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species were below the threshold of 95% ANI (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>) and 70% dDDH values (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Auch et al., 2010</xref>), which were established for prokaryotic species delineation. This suggested that these three ISS strains are novel species of the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>. These three ISS strains exhibited ANI and dDDH values around 99–100% with each other, indicating that they belong to the same species. The entire genomes of these three ISS strains, <italic>M. indicum</italic> SE2.11<sup>T</sup>, and <italic>M. platani</italic> PMB02<sup>T</sup> were aligned to detect their divergence and similarity using the MUMmer 3.0 system (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz et al., 2004</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>, genomes of these three ISS strains aligned perfectly, while the closest genomes of <italic>M. indicum</italic> and <italic>M. platani</italic> exhibited divergence with the ISS type strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>. Since these three ISS strains were isolated at different time periods and from various locations, their persistence in the ISS environment and ecological significance in the closed systems warrant further study.</p>

                <p>The fourth strain I1-R3 was identified as <italic>M. rhodesianum</italic> based on highly similar 16S rRNA (99.9%), <italic>gyrB</italic> (100%), ANI (98.9%), and dDDH (91.6%) genomic parameters with <italic>M. rhodesianum</italic> DSM 5687<sup>T</sup>. The pigmentation of the strain I1-R3 (light pink) was also different from the novel ISS <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains (reddish pink). The ANI and dDDH values between I1-R3 and the three novel ISS <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains were ∼82% and 24%, respectively. Hence, genomic and morphological analyses confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain I1-R3 as <italic>M. rhodesianum</italic>. In this communication, phylogenetic affiliations of only IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 strains were presented.</p>

                <title>Phenotypic Characterization of Novel ISS Strains</title>
                <p>The minimal information about the ISS strain genome characteristics are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. The differential phenotypic characteristics of IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 are listed in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, in comparison with other related <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. Three strains belonging to <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> sp. nov. are reddish pink–pigmented, Gram-stain-negative, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile, and rod-shaped. These strains grew well on nutrient agar and R2A. These three strains grew optimally at temperatures between 25 and 30°C, were viable only at pH 6.0 to 8.0, and exhibited poor tolerance to salt (0 to 1%). Absence of growth was observed when grown at 7, 37, and 45°C. These strains were positive for assimilation of <sc>L</sc>-arabinose, <sc>D</sc>-glucose, maltose, <sc>D</sc>-mannitol, <sc>D</sc>-mannose, malic acid, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. These strains also exhibited esterase lipase and trypsin enzymatic activities. The complete results of phenotypic characteristics determined using API 20 NE, API ZYM, and API 50 CH are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Tables 3-5</xref>, respectively. The majority of the phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains were similar to other <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains were different from the closest genomic relative <italic>M. indicum</italic> in assimilating glucose, malic acid, maltose, mannitol, potassium gluconate, and trisodium citrate. Furthermore, unlike <italic>M. indicum</italic>, these ISS strains did not exhibit growth at pH 5.0. In comparison to other <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species, <italic>M. aquaticum</italic> and <italic>M. terrae</italic> exhibit similar carbon substrate utilization and enzyme production profiles. However, malic acid was assimilated by these ISS strains but not by <italic>M. aquaticum</italic>. Maltose was also utilized by these ISS strains but not by <italic>M. terrae</italic> cells.</p>

                <p>The main phenotypic characteristics of the ISS strains IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 were in accordance with the description of the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>, with the most important being reddish pink pigmentation (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Green and Bousfield, 1982</xref>). The optimum growth conditions (temperature, pH, salt tolerance) of the ISS <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains were similar to other members belonging to the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>. Also, these three ISS strains shared the properties of exhibiting catalase activity and motility with other <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. However, the three novel ISS <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains differed from other members of the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> in some of the phenotypic characteristics, as shown in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. For instance, they exhibited properties like assimilation of certain sugars, which was absent in some of the <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. They also did not show cystine arylamidase activity as opposed to several related <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species.</p>

                <p>Based on the genome annotation, genes for nitrogen metabolism were predicted in the genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>. Most of the subsystem features aligned with the ammonia assimilation pathway (11 genes), which is a preferred nitrogen source for the bacteria (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Leigh and Dodsworth, 2007</xref>). In addition, metabolic factors similar to high-affinity phosphate transporter and control of Pho regulon were also identified in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wanner, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Interestingly, a higher number of stress tolerance genes, especially the oxidative stress response factors, were observed in the ISS strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> when compared with other novel species isolated from the ISS; <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> sp. IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> exhibited 58 features, whereas 36 features were identified in <italic>Solibacillus kalamii</italic> (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Seuylemezian et al., 2017</xref>) and 18 features were identified in <italic>Kalamiella piersonii</italic> (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). The results obtained agree with the previous reports that showed altered regulation of the stress response factors in microorganisms, in the presence of microgravity conditions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Aunins et al., 2018</xref>). Further studies on the role of oxidative stress in species selection are warranted. The WGS assembly of these three ISS strains reported here will enable the comparative genomic characterization of ISS isolates with Earth counterparts in future studies. This will further aid in the identification of genetic determinants that might potentially be responsible for promoting plant growth under microgravity conditions and contribute to the development of self-sustainable plant crops for long-term space missions in future.</p>

Furthermore, multiple components of the cobalamin synthesis pathway, such as cobalamin biosynthesis protein BluB, <sc>L</sc>-threonine 3-O-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.81), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.62), cobyric acid synthase (EC 6.3.5.10), nicotinate-nucleotide—dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.21), adenosylcobinamide-phosphate synthase (EC 6.3.1.10), cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase. (EC 2.5.1.17), cobalamin synthase (EC 2.7.8.26), and adenosylcobinamide kinase (EC 2.7.1.156), were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>. The metabolic pathway for cobalamin synthesis predicted in the ISS strain is presented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Supporting this prediction, previous study also reported that <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> strains harbor genes involved in the production of a variety of vitamins, such as cobalamin, biotin, thiamin, and riboflavin, indicating the potential of methylobacteria promoting algal growth (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Krug et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, genes associated with siderophore production, i.e., ferric siderophore transport system, biopolymer transport protein ExbB, and multiple flagellar proteins, were identified in genome of the ISS strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> and are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>. Genes involved in iron acquisition and metabolism in which microalgae benefit from bacterial siderophores have been reported previously in <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Krug et al., 2020</xref>). In the “carbon for iron mutualism” concept, algae assimilated iron complexed in bacterial siderophores and in return provided essential dissolved organic matter for the bacteria (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). Similar studies are warranted to confirm the plant-growth promoting activities in the IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> ISS strain.</p>
                <p>In summary, the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness and differential phenotypic properties were sufficient to categorize these three ISS strains as members of a species distinct from other recognized <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> species. Therefore, on the basis of the data presented, strains IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup>, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5 represent a novel species of the genus <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>, for which the name <italic>Methylobacterium ajmalii</italic> sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> (NRRL B-65601<sup>T</sup> and LMG 32165<sup>T</sup>).</p>

                <p><italic>Methylobacterium ajmalii</italic> (aj.ma’li.i. N.L. gen. n. <italic>ajmalii</italic> named after Ajmal Khan, a renowned Indian scientist on biodiversity). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and motile rods showing oxidase- and catalase-positive reactions. Cells are 1.6–1.8 μm wide and 2.2–3.2 μm long. Colonies on R2A agar are reddish pink–pigmented, circular, convex, and smooth, with a diameter of approximately 0.6–1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on R2A agar. Growth occurs at 25–30°C (optimum, 30°C), at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0–1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0%). In API ZYM tests, the strain is positive for Alkaline phosphatase, Esterase (C4), Esterase lipase (C8), Leucine arylamidase, Trypsin, Acid phosphatase, and Naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, but negative for other enzyme activities. Cells utilize Adipic acid, <sc>D</sc>-glucose, <sc>D</sc>-maltose, <sc>D</sc>-mannitol, <sc>D</sc>-mannose, L-arabinose, Malic acid, N-acetyl-glucosamine, Potassium gluconate, and Trisodium citrate for growth, but not other substrates in API 20NE. Cells are capable of weakly fermenting inulin and <sc>D</sc>-melezitose as observed in API 50 CH. Ubiquinone Q-10 is the predominant respiratory isoprenoid quinone. The major fatty acid is summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7<italic>c</italic> and/or C18:1 ω6<italic>c</italic>). The major polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The genomic DNA G + C content of the type strain is 71.07 mol%.</p>
                <p>The type strain IF7SW-B2<sup>T</sup> is isolated from the International Space Station.</p>
