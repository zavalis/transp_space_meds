              <abstract>
                <p>Exposure to microgravity conditions causes cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts during spaceflight. Until now, no specific drugs are available for countermeasure, since the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) play key roles in various vascular functions, many of which are regulated by purinergic 2 (P2) receptors. However, their function in ECs and SMCs under microgravity conditions is still unclear. In this study, primary ECs and SMCs were isolated from bovine aorta and verified with specific markers. We show for the first time that the P2 receptor expression pattern is altered in ECs and SMCs after 24 h exposure to simulated microgravity using a clinostat. However, conditioned medium compensates this change in specific P2 receptors, for example, P2X7. Notably, P2 receptors such as P2X7 might be the important players during the paracrine interaction. Additionally, ECs and SMCs secreted different cytokines under simulated microgravity, leading into a pathogenic proliferation and migration. In conclusion, our data indicate P2 receptors might be important players responding to gravity changes in ECs and SMCs. Since some artificial P2 receptor ligands are applied as drugs, it is reasonable to assume that they might be promising candidates against cardiovascular deconditioning in the future.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Exposure to microgravity conditions during space missions induces a variety of health issues in astronauts, including bone loss, muscle atrophy, decreased immune activity, and cardiovascular deconditioning [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The cardiovascular deconditioning is very likely caused by the dysfunction of the major vascular cells: endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). ECs build up the monolayer coating inner surface of blood vessels. Layers of SMCs arranged in fibers support the EC monolayer by providing contraction and relaxation of vessels [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Importantly, the interaction between ECs and SMCs has been shown to be a key player in human cardiovascular physiology [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ECs are sensitive to mechanical stress, and they secret cytokines inhibiting SMC proliferation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Purinergic receptors can bind extracellular nucleotides such as ATP [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and they are crucial players in regulating a series of physiological and pathological cardiovascular processes such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and vascular pain [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Purinergic receptors are divided into P1 receptors and P2 receptors [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. P2 receptors can be subdivided into P2X receptors that are ion channels and P2Y receptors that are G protein-coupled receptors [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Until now, seven P2X (P2X1-7) and eight P2Y (P2Y1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, and 14) have been characterized. However, the role of extracellular nucleotides on vascular cell function under microgravity condition is still unknown.</p>
              <p>Recent publications have shown that cytoskeleton arrangement, gene expression of extracellular matrix, and cell surface adhesion molecules in ECs were altered after 22 seconds and 24 h exposure to microgravity [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. ECs formed tubes after culturing for longer term (7 days) under simulated microgravity conditions using a Random Positioning Machine (RPM) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On the other hand SMCs showed suppressed proliferation and an enhanced rate of apoptosis after 72 h exposure to simulated microgravity using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, these findings were encountered when single cell type such as endothelial or smooth muscle cells was cultured under real or simulated microgravity. Considering ECs already showed to secrete different cytokines under simulated microgravity using RPM [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the important interactions between ECs and SMCs under microgravity condition should be evaluated and thus require investigations.</p>
              <p>In this study, an indirect cell coculture model was established by culturing SMCs with EC-conditioned medium and vice versa. The P2 receptor expression pattern was analyzed and compared under three conditions: normal gravity control (1 g), simulated microgravity (MG), and simulated microgravity with conditioned medium. For the simulation of microgravity a fast rotating clinostat was used, in which the cells were quickly rotated around one axis perpendicular to the direction of gravity [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The influence of conditioned medium collected from normal gravity and simulated microgravity on cell proliferation and migration was also investigated.</p>

                <p>Bovine aorta was cut longitudinal into 5 cm sections and divided again into rectangles after removing residual and connective tissues. The cut aorta into type I collagenase (10 mg/mL in PBS) coated cell culture dishes, with the inner layer (endothelium) attached to the collagenase, and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The aortic endothelial cells were slightly scraped with a cell scraper and put onto gelatin (in PBS (1% v/v)) coated culture plates [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Medium was added to the freshly scraped cells and the plates were then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> under humidified conditions. Aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated by obtaining the media layer through removal of the outer layer and scraping off the endothelial cells. The media layer was cut into 2 mm × 2 mm sections and put into cell culture dish for 2 h without medium to allow these sections adhering tightly to the surface [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The medium was added and the pieces were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> under humidified conditions for up to a week to let SMCs migrate and proliferate from the tissue pieces to the surface of culture dish.</p>

                <p>The cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Merck Millipore, Berlin, Germany) supplied with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. ECs and SMCs were split and seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, after they reached a level of 80–90% confluence. ECs and SMCs with passage number 2–4 were used. The cell line human microvascular endothelial cell-1 (HMEC-1), C2C12 (ATCC number: CRL-1772) and MG-63 (ATCC number: CRL-1427), and U-87 MG (ATCC number: HTB-14) were cultured in DMEM medium and subsequently used as positive control.</p>

                <title>2.3. Clinostat Experiments</title>
                <p>The fast-rotating 2D clinostat used in this study was originally developed by the Institute of Aerospace Medicine, German Aerospace Center (DLR) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). It has 6 parallel horizontal axes, each for fixation for up to 4 slide flasks. ECs and SMCs were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> onto 9 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture slide flasks (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany). When they reached a confluence level of 60%–70%, the culture flasks were filled up completely with DMEM medium. To avoid shear stress and thus the induction of respective metabolic changes in signal transduction pathways, for example, apoptosis, air bubbles were removed carefully. The flasks were inserted on the clinostat and rotated at 60 rpm for 24 h in the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. Controls were also filled with medium and placed simultaneously under normal gravity.</p>
                <p>Cells from the whole flask were first used to analyze the P2 receptor expression pattern that altered subtypes could be distinguished from unaffected. Later, according to the clinostat principle, only cells exposed to minimal<italic> g</italic>-forces were taken for further analysis. This means that only cells from the middle of the flask were taken (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Under a defined constant speed of 60 rpm the maximal residual acceleration at an area of 6 mm provided an optimal quality of simulated microgravity (≤0.0121 g) [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, only cells within this 6 mm area were isolated to evaluate altered P2 subtypes for both gene and protein expression in detail. To maintain the cells accurately and consistently in the center, a special chamber consisting of two cover plates, attached to a bottom plate [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], was used to allow slide insertion without wiping off the cell layer. A corresponding cell scraper was used to scratch the cells from the specific 6 mm width area in the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>).</p>

                <title>2.4. Conditioned Medium</title>
                <p>To investigate a possible paracrine influence on P2 receptor expression, ECs and SMCs were seeded in a density of 2500 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cell growth medium was collected when they were 80%–90% confluent. The conditioned medium (CM) was composed out of cell growth medium and normal DMEM medium in a ratio of 1 : 2 on respective cell type. The SMC-conditioned medium was subsequently fully added into the culture slide with ECs and set of a 24 h clinorotation as a group of EC MG + CM. The ECs in normal gravity group (EC 1 g) and in clinorotation but filled with normal DMEM medium (EC MG) were set simultaneously. The similar experiments were set for SMCs with normal gravity (SMC 1 g), clinorotation (SMC MG), and clinorotation filled with EC-conditioned medium (SMC MG + CM).</p>
                <p>To evaluate a possible paracrine effect on cell proliferation and migration, cell growth medium was collected from cells cultured 24 h in normal gravity and cultured 24 h under clinorotation, respectively. The used conditioned medium (CM) was composed out of cell growth medium and normal DMEM medium in a ratio of 1 : 2 on respective cell type. The ECs were subsequently treated with normal DMEM medium, SMC-conditioned medium from normal gravity (CM SMC + 1 g), and clinorotation (CM SMC + MG) separately for proliferation or migration assays. Similar experiments were set and performed with SMCs as well. All experiments were performed with samples from three cows.</p>

Primers for P2 receptors, EC, and SMC specific markers in the human and bovine system were designed and shown in the supplementary data available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/413708">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/413708</ext-link>. The RT-PCR conditions such as annealing temperature and magnesium concentration are given in the supplementary data as well. 1% of agarose gels were set up to evaluate the RT-PCR products.

After boiling for 5 min, the lysate samples were separated by a 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBST containing 5% BSA and incubated with anti-P2X7, P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y11, VEGFR2, VE-cadherin, PECAM-1, calponin, SMA-α, MYH-11 (1 : 500), or GAPDH antibodies (1 : 5,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with the secondary antibodies (1 : 5,000) (CALBIOCHEM, CA, USA) for 60 min at RT. After washing with TBST, immune-detection was accomplished by using the Luminata Forte Western HRP substrate (Merck Millipore, MA, USA) and images were taken using Bio-Rad Chemidoc system.</p>

                <p>All fifteen P2 receptors were analyzed for their gene expression by RT-PCR. In the first experiment, RNA was collected in one set of clinorotation experiments from the whole culture flask. All P2 receptors were expressed in ECs with the exception of P2X3 and P2Y6. Next to this P2X5, P2Y4, P2Y11, and P2Y14 were upregulated, while P2X7, P2Y1, and P2Y4 were downregulated on the gene expression level in ECs under 24 h simulated microgravity condition (MG) induced by clinorotation if compared to ECs under normal gravity (1 g) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). In a further set of clinorotation experiments, the conditioned medium collected from SMCs grown under normal gravity condition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.4">Section 2.4</xref>) was added to ECs. For this experiment, only cells grown in the 6 mm diameter area of the center were taken to isolate RNA and protein. RT-PCR data showed that although the expression of P2X7 and P2Y1 was decreased after clinorotation P2X7 in ECs showed an increase on the gene level when cultured in SMC-conditioned medium. P2Y11 protein expression in ECs was upregulated and further increased also on the SMC conditioned medium compared to P2X7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>).

                <title>3.4. Proliferation and Migration of ECs Cultured with SMC-Conditioned Medium Collected under Normal Gravity and Simulated Microgravity</title>
                <p>Conditioned medium from SMCs collected after 24 h normal gravity and after 24 h simulated microgravity was used to culture ECs evaluating the paracrine influence of SMCs on EC proliferation and migration. SMC-conditioned medium from normal gravity (SMC CM + 1 g) did not have a significant influence on EC proliferation after 24 h but caused a decrease of EC numbers after 48 h.

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we showed for the first time that several specific P2 receptor expressions were altered on gene and protein level after 24 h under simulated microgravity condition as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Culturing ECs with SMC-conditioned medium under normal gravity and vice versa can compensate the P2 receptor expression change such as P2X7.</p>
              <p>Similar to the findings of Wang and colleagues [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], our data showed that ECs and SMCs expressed different P2 receptors on cell membrane. P2X4, P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y11 were predominantly expressed in ECs, while P2X1 and P2Y2 were strongly expressed in SMCs. Macrovascular and microvascular ECs have shown the several functional differences such as matrix metalloproteinase expression [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and beta-adrenergic regulation of transendothelial permeability [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The expression of P2X3 and P2Y4 is low in bovine aortic ECs if compared to the control HMEC-1 which suggests that macrovascular ECs might differ in the P2 receptor expression pattern compared to microvascular ECs.</p>
              <p>The P2 receptor expression patterns of ECs and SMCs have already been shown to play an important role in various cardiovascular functions. For example, in controlling vascular tone, ATP and UTP released from ECs act on P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 leading to the production of NO and subsequent vasodilatation. Simultaneously, ATP released by the sympathetic nerve acts on P2X1, P2X2, and P2X4, resulting in vasoconstriction [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We found that the expression of P2X2 and P2X4 in SMCs was significantly increased after clinorotation indicating to maybe more vasoconstriction. Next to this P2Y1 and P2Y2 expressions were decreased, which suggests NO production might decrease and cause less vasodilatation. Kang and colleagues found that 72 h exposure to clinorotation led to a decreased proliferation but increased the rate of apoptotic SMCs. Additionally, the SMC phenotype was induced and transferred from the contractive to the synthetic type [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our data showed that the expression of P2X7 and P2Y2 was altered differentially between ECs and SMCs under simulated microgravity, which indicates that they could be the key P2 receptor subtypes responding to the change of gravity. To point out, P2X7 has an important role in cell apoptosis and can activate a series of downstream signals due to several protein kinase binding sites on its long intracellular tail [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A mechanical force such as shear stress can induce endothelial cell apoptosis that might be regulated through P2X7. It is of interest that P2X7, which was downregulated in ECs, was upregulated in SMCs. This change could be compensated by adding conditioned medium from the other cell type. Such compensation was not found in the other P2 receptor subtypes which might point to P2X7 as a major player in the interaction between ECs and SMCs in simulated microgravity with respect to apoptosis regulation.</p>
              <p>Various proteins of endothelial cells are altered under real or simulated microgravity, such as F-actin [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], tubulin [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], cell adhesion molecules [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], integrins [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], eNOS [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and iNOS [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In line with that ECs also showed a decreased proliferation rate, increased apoptosis [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and migration [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in simulated microgravity. However, these data were observed based on cultured ECs as single cell type, either under real or simulated microgravity. An EC and SMC coculture model was successfully created via EC-conditioned medium culturing SMCs and vice versa. In addition to the paracrine effect on P2 receptor expression such as P2X7, our results showed that this effect found under simulated microgravity could influence EC or SMC behavior for cell proliferation and migration. SMC proliferation has been demonstrated to be a crucial process in atherosclerosis since migrated and proliferating SMCs form a major cell type in the plaque [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>In healthy vessels ECs secrete cytokines that inhibit SMC proliferation and form a monolayer to block small molecules from blood that might cause SMC proliferation. We found that conditioned medium collected from ECs in normal gravity inhibited SMC proliferation, but conditioned medium collected from ECs after clinorotation was not able to do so. On the other hand, EC damage or dysfunction is one of the first steps during the development of pathological change in atherosclerosis. The conditioned medium of SMC grown in simulated microgravity reduced EC proliferation. Enhanced apoptosis was observed when only ECs were cultured in simulated microgravity by Infanger and coauthors [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They found several caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-9 activated after simulated microgravity treatment. Apoptosis might be induced by activation of NF-<italic>κ</italic>B via the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These data suggest that astronauts may be more prone to suffer from cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis during space missions and paracrine effects between ECs and SMCs might be the key factors in this process. On the other hand migration of ECs is the first step in angiogenesis and a major factor in metastasis. In addition, it also plays an important role in restenosis in the vascular system after application of a stent. There are evidences that microgravity can promote angiogenesis in both macrovascular and microvascular ECs when only ECs were cultured under simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our data showed an enhanced number of migrated ECs when cultured with SMC-conditioned medium derived after clinostat application, compared to the DMEM control and SMC-conditioned medium collected after 24 h exposure to normal gravity. This indicates the effect of microgravity might enhance the angiogenesis via both autocrine and paracrine signals.</p>
              <p>Contradictory observations have been demonstrated in several publications; for example, EC migration increased in simulated microgravity both in this study and in the study of Siamwala and colleagues [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] while Versari and colleagues found a decreased EC migration under simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. One explanation for these findings might be that different endothelial cells were used such as primary endothelial cells from an artery or umbilical vein, or an endothelial cell line (EAhy926), which might give a different response due to its immortalization and thus prolonged time in culture. Another explanation could be that different devices were applied to simulate microgravity conditions such as the clinostat, the RPM, and the RWV. Different equipment might produce different qualities of microgravity as well as a different amount and quality of shear stress during rotation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Clinorotation was shown to produce the lowest shear forces and the central area used in our study has an optimized simulated microgravity environment [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, different ECs from different body parts were used. Macrovascular and microvascular ECs already revealed a difference in promoting angiogenesis under real/simulated microgravity conditions, which is regulated via the iNOS-cGMP-PKG pathway in macrovascular ECs but via eNOS-PI3K-Akt in microvascular ECs [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Taken together, the simulated microgravity data independently of ground-based facility we use have to be approved and verified in real microgravity for a final statement on the outcome.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusion</title>
              <p>Our data show for the first time that P2 receptor gene and protein expression in both ECs and SMCs were altered under simulated microgravity. SMC-conditioned medium collected under simulated microgravity influenced some P2 receptor expressions as well as proliferation and migration of ECs and vice versa. Additionally, proliferation and migration of ECs and SMCs differed between conditioned medium collected under normal gravity and under simulated microgravity. These data suggest that the extracellular environment such as paracrine signals is an important factor and cannot be ignored considering the impact of microgravity on vascular cells. Since some P2 receptor artificial ligands are already applied as drugs for cardiovascular patients, specific P2 receptor ligands might be reasonable candidates to investigating their function for cardiovascular deconditioning under microgravity in the future.</p>

P2X5, P2Y4, P2Y11, P2Y13 were up-regulated and P2X7, P2Y1 and P2Y2 were down-regulated in the ECs after 24 h in the clinostat (a). Cells grown within 6 mm of the center had the optimal simulated microgravity condition and were therefore isolated to confirm the above P2 receptor alteration on the RNA (b) and protein (c) level after 24 h simulated microgravity with and without SMC-conditioned medium collected under normal gravity. P2X5 and P2Y11 were up-regulated in ECs but P2X5 up-regulation was not significant on protein level. P2X7, P2Y1, P2Y2 were down-regulated on both gene and protein level. The SMC-conditioned medium can compensate the decrease of P2X7 expression but cause no significant effect on the alteration of P2Y1, P2Y2 and P2Y11.

To evaluate the EC proliferation, normal DMEM medium, and conditioned medium of SMCs after normal gravity (SMC CM + 1 g) and simulated microgravity (SMC CM + MG), was added for a 24 h and 48 h culture period. The conditioned medium from SMCs after normal gravity showed a decrease of EC numbers after 48 h. SMC-conditioned medium under simulated microgravity inhibited EC proliferation significantly after 24 h and 48 h incubation (a). To evaluate EC migration, ECs were scratched and normal DMEM medium, SMC-conditioned medium under normal gravity and under simulated microgravity was added for a 24 h culture period (b).

To investigate the SMC proliferation, normal DMEM medium, and EC-conditioned medium under normal gravity (EC CM + 1 g) and simulated microgravity (EC CM + MG), was added and SMCs were subsequently incubated for 24 h and 48 h. Conditioned medium from EC grown under normal gravity (EC CM + 1 g) significantly inhibited SMC proliferation after 24 h and 48 h incubation and conditioned medium from EC grown under simulated microgravity (EC CM + MG) led to a significant decrease of SMC numbers after 24 h, which is not obvious after 48 h (a). To evaluate SMC migration, SMCs were scratched and cultured under normal DMEM medium, EC-conditioned medium under normal gravity and under simulated microgravity for 24 h (b).

                <p>Scheme of P2 Receptor Alteration and the Postulated Paracrine Effect in ECs and SMCs under Simulated Microgravity. Several P2 receptor expressions were altered in ECs and SMCs under 24 h simulated microgravity condition using a clinostat. To point out that the expression P2X7 and P2Y2 was altered differentially between ECs and SMCs under simulated microgravity. Especially, the change of P2X7 in ECs was compensated under SMC-conditioned medium and vice versa. The conditioned medium collected under simulated microgravity showed the pathogenic influence of EC and SMC proliferation and migration if compared to condition medium from normal gravity.</p>
