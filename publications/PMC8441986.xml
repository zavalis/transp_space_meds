                <title>SUMMARY</title>
                <p id="P3">We have identified and validated a spaceflight-associated microRNA (miRNA) signature that is shared by rodents and humans in response to simulated, short-duration and long-duration spaceflight. Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally, a subset of these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P6">Humans and vertebrate organisms exhibit a unique set of biological responses to the space environment, including bone and muscle atrophy (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Burkhart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Gerbaix et al., 2017</xref>), immune dysfunction (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Baqai et al., 2009</xref>), neurobehavioral changes (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Ronca et al., 2019</xref>), vision impairment (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Mader et al., 2011</xref>), and cardiovascular damage (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Elgart et al., 2018</xref>). Ionizing radiation (IR) and microgravity are the main biological stressors in low-Earth orbit (LEO), which is the region encompassed by the Earth’s magnetosphere where all crewed missions currently occur. Although exposure to deep space radiation, which is primarily composed of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), is reduced within LEO due to the magnetosphere, IR still poses a risk to astronauts in LEO, and GCRs are a critical health risk in the upcoming lunar and Mars missions (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Townsend, 2005</xref>). Thus, combining LEO experiments with ground-based analogs of spaceflight stressors, including simulated GCRs, allows investigations into the mechanisms behind biological responses to spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="P7">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nucleotides long) sequences of non-coding RNA that can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level and interact directly with proteins (<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Vanderburg and Beheshti, 2020</xref>). miRNAs have been implicated as predictors and regulators for several diseases, including cancer (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Macfarlane and Murphy, 2010</xref>), neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Konovalova et al., 2019</xref>), and autoimmune disorders (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). miRNAs have also been found to be involved in biological responses to both microgravity (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Girardi et al., 2014</xref>) and IR (<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Simone et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, identifying miRNAs (and their networks) that are shared between humans and model organisms in response to spaceflight stressors could reveal targets for biomarker and countermeasure development to reduce the associated health risks.</p>
              <p id="P8">Previously, we used spaceflown rodent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the NASA GeneLab database to make unbiased predictions about miRNAs potentially involved in regulating the transcriptional response to spaceflight (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2018</xref>). The datasets analyzed in that study are described in the <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>. Our analysis identified a set of 13 spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were predicted to drive a systemic response and suggested transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 as an overarching regulator of their expression (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2018</xref>). TGF-β1 is a major regulatory cytokine mediating the progression of cancer (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Rooke and Crosier, 2001</xref>), autoimmunity (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Marie et al., 2006</xref>), and neuroinflammation (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Cekanaviciute et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is important to note that this spaceflight-associated miRNA signature was defined computationally, based on transcriptomic analysis, and not measured experimentally.</p>
              <p id="P9">Here, we experimentally validated the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature by quantifying circulating miRNAs in serum from rodents exposed to simulated spaceflight conditions: microgravity, partial gravity, LEO-relevant IR, simulated deep space radiation, and combined exposures to reduced gravity and simulated space radiation, as well as true spaceflight in LEO. We supported spaceflight-stressor-mediated changes in the expression of the predicted miRNAs by performing agnostic miRNA-seq in selected datasets, and our experimental validation also incorporated simulated deep space radiation conditions to help evaluate the extent to which the miRNA signature may be shared by different space environments. Finally, we addressed the human relevance of our findings by analyzing miRNAs released by irradiated human immune cells <italic>ex vivo</italic> and miRNA expression changes in astronauts from the NASA Twins Study <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P10">We expanded our initial panel of 13 candidate miRNAs (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2018</xref>) to include 15 target miRNAs with the following justifications: (1) miRNA let-7 was subdivided into two more specific family members (let-7a and let-7c) identified in recent space biology studies (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Režen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), and (2) an additional miRNA (miR-92a) was added after analyzing astronaut data from the NASA Twins Study. Furthermore, we investigated the potential downstream effects of spaceflight-associated human miRNAs using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing of a targeted gene panel of leukocyte-depleted fractions in the NASA Twins Study (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we compared gene expression in cells collected within 3 days upon spaceflown twin’s (TW) return to his preflight and postflight samples, as well as control samples taken from the ground control twin (HR). Single-cell transcriptomics also let us determine the individual cell types that display the strongest perturbations in gene expression consistent with miRNA signatures identified in bulk transcriptomics, and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC) sequencing data were used to delineate chromatin changes that may have altered the accessibility of the spaceflight-associated miRNAs.</p>

                <title>Predicted Spaceflight miRNA Signature in Rodents Was Validated Using Simulated Microgravity and Deep Space Radiation</title>
                <p id="P11">To validate the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA panel, we quantified their changes in response to ground analogs of individual spaceflight stressors in rodent models: simulated microgravity using hindlimb unloading (HU) (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998</xref>) as well as IR using either gamma rays or major components of galactic cosmic rays—protons and/or high mass and charge <sup>56</sup>Fe particles (deep space relevant exposure) (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Mewaldt, 1994</xref>). We exposed male 16-week-old C57BL/6J mice to HU, IR, or their combination and measured the set of selected 15 miRNAs in their serum at 1 or 11 days post-exposure using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Hindson et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P12">Euclidean clustering of serum miRNA concentrations separated the miRNAs into two main clusters: (1) deep-space-radiation-associated clusters, which are significantly regulated by <sup>56</sup>Fe IR and <sup>56</sup>Fe IR in combination with HU; and (2) microgravity-associated clusters, primarily altered in HU-only conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>–<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). An additional subset of miRNAs was significantly increased in mouse serum only, early (1 day) after exposure to the combination of mixed proton/<sup>56</sup>Fe irradiation and HU, but was not affected by individual stressors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, we have provided a discussion regarding potential hemolysis that might occur with the serum/plasma samples utilized throughout this manuscript in the <xref rid="S10" ref-type="sec">STAR Methods</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P13">Most miRNAs (with the exception of miR-217) were observed to increase with radiation dose and linear energy transfer (LET; gamma &lt; 150 MeV proton &lt; 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe) in mouse serum both at 1 day and 11 days post-IR. At 11 days post-IR, the only significant miRNA increases were observed in IR-only (no HU) mice irradiated with either 1 Gy or 2 Gy 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe or 1 Gy protons (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). In combination, these results indicate that the miRNA signature is mainly driven by the particle radiation component, which is proportional to dose and LET.</p>
                <p id="P14">Based on all miRNAs that were significantly different in spaceflight-associated conditions, we predicted the top 50 targeted genes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), key diseases regulated by the miRNAs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), and significant pathways (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The top 50 genes targeted by these miRNAs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) primarily regulate cell-cycle pathways and protein kinase activity, in addition to hematopoiesis and blood cell development (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The majority of diseases regulated by these miRNAs are related to cancer (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), though we also uncovered other diseases associated with spaceflight, including cardiovascular (green circles), neurological (yellow circles) and digestive disorders (purple circles), and muscular degeneration (orange circles) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, key significantly regulated pathways include carcinogenesis as well as TGF-β signaling, which supports our previous prediction of TGF-β as a key regulator of spaceflight-associated miRNA functions and implies downstream carcinogenic and immune effects. Finally, the pathways also include adherens junctions, which, combined with cardiovascular disease associations, suggests vascular impacts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P15">To examine the contribution of reduced gravity to the miRNA signature at higher resolution, a partial weight bearing (PWB) Wistar male rat model (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Mortreux et al., 2018</xref>) was used to simulate varying degrees of gravitational loading. We observed that decreasing amounts of gravitational loading increased the quantities of miRNAs of interest, suggesting a gravity-dependent dose response (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). These results also validated a reduced-gravity-specific miRNA signature in both mice and rats and separated the miRNAs associated with reduced gravity from those associated with exposure to simulated deep space radiation in mice. The only observed exception was miR-217, which did not change. A similar miRNA dose response was observed based on correlation with muscle mass (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>): the miRNAs of interest increased with reduced muscle mass (which is associated with lower simulated gravity both in this rat model and in astronauts).</p>
                <p id="P16">Notably, this model included two control groups of animals exposed to full gravitational loading: no harness (NH) and full harness (FH) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Both conditions had been included in prior studies, and no functional or phenotypical differences were recorded, although there was a difference in miRNA expression between NH and FH 100% gravity groups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), possibly due to a trend in reduction in muscle mass in FH controls (not significant). Therefore, further comparison between groups included only the FH control (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

                <title>Predicted Spaceflight miRNA Signature Was Partially Observed in Serum from Mice Exposed to LEO</title>
                <p id="P17">Next, we investigated whether the spaceflight-environment-linked miRNA signature is distinguishable in true spaceflight samples, using serum from young and old female BALB/cAnNTac mice flown to the International Space Station (ISS) on Rodent Research Mission 8. In contrast with the simulated spaceflight cohorts, these mice experienced short-lasting hypergravity during takeoff and landing in addition to microgravity while in orbit, spent 4 days reacclimating on ground after the flight before sample collection, and received a significantly lower dose of IR than simulation experiments: 0.01128 Gy over approximately 30 days on the ISS.</p>
                <p id="P18">Although the combined mouse cohort did not exhibit any significantly increased miRNAs compared to basal (no spaceflight, normal housing conditions) controls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), when the samples were separated by age (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>), we observed clustering between spaceflight and basal controls in the older group (31–37 weeks at sacrifice) corresponding to middle-age in humans, which is more representative of typical astronaut cohorts, and no detectable clustering in the younger group (10–16 weeks at sacrifice) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref>–<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). Considering that these mice had 4 days to reacclimate to ground conditions before the samples were collected, these results may suggest that it takes longer for serum miRNA levels to return to basal levels in older mice, while younger mice recover faster. This finding is consistent with our prior results from simulated spaceflight studies, in which miRNA levels in irradiated mice start to return to control by 11 days following an over-100-fold-higher dose of IR than received by the spaceflown mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P19">Another notable result from this spaceflight experiment is the correlation between organ weights and miRNA concentration in spaceflight mice and basal controls. Normalized to total body weight, adrenal gland weight increases with concentration of the majority of quantified miRNAs, and, conversely, brain weight decreases with increasing miRNA concentrations. While these correlations are not statistically significant, they suggest the possibility of lingering impacts on specific organs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Increases in adrenal gland weight might be related to chronic stress, since the adrenal gland regulates stress responses (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich-Lai et al., 2006</xref>) that have been previously associated with increased systemic corticosterone levels during spaceflight (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Pecaut et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, a volumetric reduction of brain features has been observed in cosmonauts (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Pechenkova et al., 2019</xref>), though the physiological relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated. Since systemic increases in corticosterone levels also lead to reduced brain weight (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Coburn-Litvak et al., 2004</xref>), chronic stress might be an underlying factor behind both adrenal gland and brain results, and future studies are needed to examine miRNA as its potential biomarker.</p>

                <title>Spaceflight-Relevant miRNA Signature Was Also Identified in Agnostic Sequencing Study of Simulated-Spaceflight-Exposed Mice</title>
                <p id="P20">To understand the specificity and variation of spaceflight-relevant miRNA levels within the global miRNA population, miRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice after exposure to simulated spaceflight conditions: normal loading (NL) or HU for 2 weeks prior to irradiation with 5 Gy gamma, 1 Gy simulated solar particle event (simSPE), 0.5 Gy simulated simplified galactic cosmic rays (SimGCRSim), or sham control. SimGCRSim consists of five ions: protons at 1000 MeV, <sup>28</sup>Si at 600 MeV/n, <sup>4</sup>He at 250 MeV/n, <sup>16</sup>O at 350 MeV/n, <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et al., 2020</xref>). This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 min instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Simulated solar particle event (SimSPE) irradiation consists of protons from 50 MeV to 150 MeV. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, the mice were sacrificed, and miRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from the plasma, heart, liver, and soleus muscle.</p>
                <p id="P21">We observed highly variable miRNA expression profiles between organs, with the exception of heart and soleus muscle (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). This variation underscores the importance of establishing a circulating systemic miRNA signature that can be measured in plasma, which is the most accessible source for biomarker evaluation in spaceflight conditions. Additionally, the high correlation between miRNA expression changes in heart and soleus muscle unsurprisingly suggests that the damage in these muscle tissues may be driven by similar changes in miRNAs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Notably, miRNA-seq profiles from plasma also are more heterogeneous than those from individual organs, suggesting that plasma miRNA quantification might allow a more finely tuned spaceflight signature that could differentiate between different types of exposures or provide personalized risk assessment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P22">Comparison of significantly regulated miRNAs identified four miRNAs that are increased in all organs in the GCR+HU (“combined spaceflight stressors”) group compared to sham NL (“no spaceflight stressors” control) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, we decided to focus on the GCR+HU irradiated group for further analysis. We computed the top 20 genes regulated by the four common differentially expressed miRNAs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) as well as the pathways that were significantly regulated by these genes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and found potential cardiovascular as well as systemic circulatory targets (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P23">We next quantified miRNA fold changes between GCR/SPE/Gamma+HU and sham NL conditions, focusing on the panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs (top 15) as well as the four additional miRNAs that were found to be shared among all tissues for GCR+HU versus NL by miRNA-seq (bottom 4) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Additional data is available in a companion paper (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Wuu et al., 2020</xref>). We observed trends or significance for multiple spaceflight miRNAs, and the same miRNA family members differentially expressed across multiple tissues. For example, for miRNA-503-5p, expression was decreased in the liver, soleus, and heart but strongly increased in plasma (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating potential organ-dependent miRNA changes with the key systemic stressor response stemming from the circulating miRNAs. MiR-503 belongs to the miR-16 extended family (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Caporali and Emanueli, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), which is one of the miRNAs predicted to be involved in the spaceflight response (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and impacts cardiovascular diseases through the inhibition of angiogenesis (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Besnier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Caporali and Emanueli, 2011</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P24">Finally, we performed pathway analysis utilizing the miRNA-seq data with C2 curated gene sets from MSigDB on the miRNA-seq data and displayed all significantly regulated pathways (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) for the liver and soleus muscle. Data for the plasma and heart tissues are in companion papers and show similar results (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Wuu et al., 2020</xref>), and the pathways that showed suppression (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p value &lt; 0.25; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) have been previously implicated in cardiovascular adaptations to spaceflight (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These specific pathways were selected for the countermeasure experiments (below). This experiment demonstrates that although the individual response of the miRNAs might not be significantly regulated, the global response of miRNAs on downstream gene targets reveals regulation by miRNAs belonging to the spaceflight signature.</p>

                <title>Spaceflight-Associated Rodent miRNA Signature Was Partially Shared by Human Responses <italic>Ex Vivo</italic> and <italic>In Vivo</italic></title>
                <p id="P25">We next show that spaceflight-associated miRNA signature is partially conserved in human samples that had been exposed to real or simulated space environment conditions. First, we analyzed human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to 0.3 Gy 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe particles that form a biologically significant component of GCRs, using PBMCs isolated from 12 healthy human (non-astronaut) donors. Thus, this experiment simulated deep-space-relevant radiation, without simulating microgravity. We observed an increase in spaceflight-associated miRNAs in the supernatant of irradiated PBMCs 4 hours, post-irradiation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>–<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>), as well as a positive correlation with increasing donor BMI and cell number (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>) .</p>
                <p id="P26">Finally, in order to assess the impact of the real spaceflight environment on human cells, we analyzed miRNA-sequence data on total PBMC and lymphocyte-depleted (LD) samples from the NASA Twins Study. This study involved actual LEO (low-LET radiation and microgravity) exposure for 340 days for a total of 146.34 mSv (or 0.1463 Gy). Unsorted PBMCs isolated during and after LEO spaceflight showed persistent changes in miRNA expression for the astronaut in space, which partially follows the predicted spaceflight signature (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, LD cells sampled before and after flight also indicated persistent changes in miRNA expression, though not all miRNAs behaved as predicted by the spaceflight signature (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, the spaceflown twin (TW) had consistently higher expression of the miRNA target genes compared to the HR even at baseline/preflight, despite having higher levels of miRNAs as well (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>); thus, TW pre-flight levels were considered a better control than ground control twin (HR) pre-flight levels. This difference in miRNA expression is not surprising, due to known discordant miRNA expression profiles in twins (<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P27">Of the miRNAs found in the irradiated PBMC panel, only miR-92a-3p was significantly downregulated and let-7c-5p was upregulated in the TW miRNA-sequence data (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). However, the downstream targets of the irradiation-associated miRNAs were significantly decreased between preflight and postflight samples, except the targets of hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-26a-5p. This suggests that there was an increase in some irradiation-associated miRNA functions in TW, and the effects of miR-92a-3p and miR-26a-5p were more acute than the other miRNAs. Similar to the lack of response of miR-217 in animal models based on ddPCR results, miR-217 only had three targets within the targeted panel, none of which were significantly changed by spaceflight, indicating that miR-217, although implicated by original unbiased <italic>in silico</italic> predictions, does not respond to the stress of the space environment.</p>
                <p id="P28">We next analyzed the changes in miRNA expression across different blood cell populations that were associated with spaceflight-mediated miRNA differences in the same NASA Twins Study. Specifically, we conducted targeted scRNA-seq and scAb-seq (epitope mapping) of LD Twins Study samples across multiple time points. In total, 23,408 cells were sequenced across 12 samples: 6 TW and 6 HR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Cell types were identified on a per cluster basis by both RNA and epitope levels (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Module scores for the targets of the subset of spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were found to be upregulated in irradiated human PBMCs were calculated using Seurat and compared among TW preflight, return, and postflight samples (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref>–<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5N</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P29">When the cell population was split by cell type, we observed that the changes in miRNA-mediated gene expression were highly variable across cell types (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5O</xref>). Dividing each cell type into ground, preflight, return, and postflight groups demonstrated that individual cell types were differentially affected by spaceflight-associated miRNAs. For example, CD14<sup>+</sup> and CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes responded differently to hsa-miR-92a-3p: CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes showed <italic>decreased</italic> expression of hsa-miR-92a-3p targets, while CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes expressed <italic>higher</italic> levels of hsa-miR-92a-3p target genes upon return compared to either preflight or postflight. Progenitor (circulating hematopoietic stem) cells stood out in this analysis, as expression of the spaceflight-associated miRNA target genes increased specifically at the return time point. These differences among cell types indicate that immune cell composition may play a role in the downstream effects of spaceflight-associated miRNA increases and suggest return to Earth as a major stressor affecting miRNA expression.</p>

                <title>The Increase in Expression of Spaceflight-Associated miRNAs Is Not Driven by Epigenetic Changes</title>
                <p id="P30">To determine whether the changes in miRNA expression were due to spaceflight-induced chromatin changes, we used scATAC-seq on 11,344 cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S5</xref>). SnapTools and SnapATAC were used to create 5-kb bins across the genome and determine genome accessibility based on ATAC activity per cell, and then genes and miRNAs were assigned the ATAC activity based on the overlapping bin. ATAC activity is associated with chromatin accessibility, which can be used to determine whether the miRNAs upregulated in irradiated PBMCs were differently accessible in TW during spaceflight (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Of note, open chromatin peaks were observed at let-7c-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-125b-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-146a-5p. Furthermore, both control PBMCs and HR ground PMBCs displayed consistent ATAC peaks across the majority of the miRNA loci. Together, this suggests that the chromatin around these miRNA loci is open but not strongly affected by spaceflight. In addition, we assessed ATAC activity in different cell types (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). The module score and dot plots of the miRNAs upregulated in irradiated PBMCs demonstrate that CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and pre-dendritic cells (pDCs) show more miRNA accessibility that other cell populations (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>), indicating that chromatin states depend more on immune cell type than spaceflight.</p>
                <p id="P31">We next investigated immune cell composition at different time points during flight, specifically the proportion of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Due to a low number of cells in the TW preflight sample, data from ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq experiments were combined to determine the immune cell distribution in LD fractions. (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, the TW return samples had the highest proportion of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. This result, combined with the scRNA-seq of downstream targets, suggests that miRNA expression during spaceflight is regulated not by chromatin accessibility, but by immune cell distribution, and is particularly high in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes. Finally, we evaluated whether specific ATAC peak changes correlated with expression levels from the Twins Study miRNA-seq (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>). However, ATAC activity was observed in the HR samples for upregulated miRNAs, indicating that the chromatin was already open prior to spaceflight.</p>

                <title>Selective Inhibition of Spaceflight-Associated miRNAs Reduces Cardiovascular Damage in a Human Tissue Model after Exposure to Simulated Deep Space Radiation</title>
                <p id="P32">Finally, we developed and utilized a mature human 3D microvascular tissue model (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Grabham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">Templin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Wuu et al., 2020</xref>) seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to examine the physiological effects of the candidate miRNAs on structural cardiovascular damage caused by heavy ion irradiation (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Grabham et al., 2011</xref>; unpublished data). Forty-eight hours after irradiation with 0.5 Gy SimGCRSim, several of the candidate miRNAs showed marked increases compared to controls (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), though the increases were not significant, possibly due to low sample numbers.</p>
                <p id="P33">Three of the miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) that were increased by SimGCRSim irradiation were also previously predicted to be associated with space-radiation-induced cardiovascular damage (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2019</xref>) and were chosen to be inhibited using antagomirs (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Krützfeldt et al., 2005</xref>). Further data showing that these miRNAs are associated with disrupted angiogenesis following IR have been reported elsewhere (<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Wuu, et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, these miRNAs show consistent presence and impact on downstream functions in the space environment (i.e., Twins Study data) compared to all other miRNAs. Antagomirs were applied 24 h before irradiation, and morphology of the tissue constructs was assessed 48 h after irradiation with 0.5 Gy SimGCRSim. We observed irradiation-mediated loss of vascularization because the microvessels had shrunk or collapsed, indicating that 0.5 Gy SimGCRSim is sufficient to disrupt microvessels. This impact of SimGCRSim exposure was reversed by application of the three antagomirs 24 h before irradiation, while a scrambled antagomir control did not induce the rescue phenotype (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7B</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Based on the summary of the of spaceflight-stressor-induced changes across all miRNAs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>) and the miRNAs that have global significant impact on the downstream gene targets determined in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>), it is apparent that these three miRNAs have a uniform trend across all different conditions (red shaded miRNAs in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Thus, microvessel structure was protected by selectively inhibiting three miRNAs that are the most universally associated with spaceflight responses, proving that the vascular impairments caused by simulated deep space radiation are at least partially mediated through miRNAs and in the future might be rescued using antagomirs in human tissue constructs. Future steps to further explore the impact of this potential countermeasure will be performed in murine models and are currently ongoing. Although the results with the antagomirs are promising in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model, we still cannot account for the complexity in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model and the efficacy of this treatment.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P34">In summary, we have validated the previously predicted panel of candidate spaceflight-relevant miRNAs using a combination of spaceflight, simulated microgravity, partial gravity, and simulated deep space radiation conditions in male and female mouse and rat <italic>in vivo</italic>, astronaut, and human <italic>ex vivo</italic> models. The majority of rodent serum miRNAs followed the pattern of dose-dependent increase in response to IR, with the notable exception of miR-217 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). We evaluated the applicability of this miRNA signature to humans by examining miRNA content in the supernatant of primary human immune cell samples exposed to simulated deep space radiation, as well as immune cells from the NASA Twins Study, and observed partial conservation across species. The functional significance of key miRNAs was predicted by analyzing miRNA-dependent changes in gene expression at the single-cell level in the NASA Twins Study and experimentally evaluated utilizing antagomirs to mitigate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation in a 3D human microvascular tissue model. When viewing these results independently, it may appear that some level of variability occurs for the miRNA between the different conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), but when observing all conditions together, this variability is in fact accounted for, based on which component of the space environment is being observed. A summary of how all the miRNA patterns and downstream targets demonstrate the consistency over all the models utilized for this study is shown in <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>. For example, certain miRNAs (e.g., let-7a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-223-3p) are more significantly regulated with microgravity experiments as opposed space radiation experiments, while other miRNAs (e.g., miR-16-5p) are consistently being expressed in all conditions (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P35">Collectively, our samples identify two spaceflight miRNA signatures, the first associated with reduced gravity and LEO and the second representing the responses to simulated deep space radiation. Specifically, gamma-irradiated mice, sham HU mice, PWB rats, ISS-flown mice, and the Twins Study data collectively display a LEO/microgravity miRNA signature, while 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe and proton-irradiated mice, human PBMCs, and human 3D microvascular tissue models exposed to 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe ions and simplified simulated GCRs show a deep-space-radiation-dependent signature (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Notably, significant overlaps exist between both signatures, indicating a miRNA panel that might be particularly relevant to future lunar and Mars missions that will combine both stressors. The absence of significant differences in miRNA-217 expression in these datasets serves as a negative control and demonstrates that the responses that had been observed in the remaining candidate miRNAs are unlikely to be caused by universal miRNA increases induced by an arbitrary stressor.</p>
              <p id="P36">A miRNA signature unique to the spaceflight response has potential uses as a biomarker of systemic biological damage as well as a source for targets for mitigating the health risks caused by spaceflight and deep space radiation. While specific miRNAs have previously been implicated in spaceflight-associated biological damage (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Girardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Simone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Teodori et al., 2019</xref>), recent systems biology studies indicate that using an entire miRNA network as a biomarker can provide a more robust association with biological changes (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we have observed that individual components of the space environment have unique miRNA signatures: some miRNAs are associated with the microgravity component of real or simulated spaceflight, others are associated with exposure to deep space radiation, and still others are only significantly increased after exposure to both, suggesting that different miRNA-based biomarkers would be applicable to different conditions, with the latter being particularly important in deep space exploration. The sensitivity of miRNA responses is underscored by the fact that the magnitude of miRNA increases appears to be dose dependent for both radiation and microgravity, as observed in the mouse simulated space environment model and the PWB rat model, respectively. Similarly, for the IR component, the signature is also LET dependent, as we report more significant miRNA changes after 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe compared to proton or gamma irradiation, which suggests its potential relevance for future deep space missions. Finally, conserved increases of key miRNAs across species, sexes, and experiments emphasizes the reliability of the miRNA signature.</p>
              <p id="P37">Since the majority of the data in this paper are from males, there can be sex-specific differences that are not captured here. It has been shown that certain miRNAs and family members of miRNAs are significantly expressed in one sex over the other, in normal and cancerous (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas) tissues (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). For example, miR-503 is linked to female-related cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Florijn et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that miRNAs in the same family have similar behaviors in different sexes while still linked to the original family of miRNAs. Future research will need to explore the sex differences and the spaceflight signatures for specific miRNAs as well as related miRNA family members.</p>
              <p id="P38">Of note, miRNA signatures may be applied for improving astronaut health by providing the first step toward identifying a network of circulating regulatory molecules that are activated by spaceflight. Identifying, validating and targeting such systemic regulatory networks, as opposed to addressing symptomatic damage in isolated organs and tissues, may accelerate our ability to mitigate the damage to several organ systems at once. Additionally, this approach may be used for preemptive risk reduction.</p>
              <p id="P39">Indeed, we experimentally demonstrated the countermeasure potential of miRNAs by using antagomirs to inhibit three miRNAs associated with spaceflight cardiovascular health risks in human 3D tissue models. In general, antagomirs are a powerful tool for preventing the downstream effects of miRNA, which can be extensive due to the ability of a single miRNA to interact with hundreds of genes at the transcriptional, translational, and protein levels (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Krützfeldt et al., 2005</xref>). Antagomirs have been shown to effectively inhibit their miRNA targets <italic>in vivo</italic> in mouse models of disease; however, more research is required for understanding their off-target effects and tissue specificity (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Ishida and Selaru, 2013</xref>). In our model, antagomirs were applied as a countermeasure prior to deep-space-relevant irradiation and successfully prevented microvascular damage. Thus, our suggested network of miRNAs and their implied targets not only provides mechanistic insight into spaceflight-induced organ damage, but also may be a valuable platform for preventing the adverse health effects of spaceflight. However, in our experiments, the antagomir therapy was only applied against the cardiovascular component of the miRNA signature due to the model only recapitulating human microvasculature. It would be important to measure the effects of miRNA inhibition of the rest of the miRNA signature in a model that more fully captures spaceflight-mediated immune dysfunction and cancer progression as well as <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
              <p id="P40">The panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs has been predicted to disrupt cell signaling and metabolic pathways, at least in part via their interactions with TGF-β1 (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2018</xref>). TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been shown previously to be significantly modulated during spaceflight conditions (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Jessup et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Westerlind and Turner, 1995</xref>), and its expression has been successfully altered as a therapeutic approach in cancer and inflammation. However, TGF-β1 is involved in a wide variety of endothelial and immune cell processes, which makes it a risky target (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Otten et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, given that TGF-β1 has been found to exert both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects at different stages of tumorigenesis (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Ikushima and Miyazono, 2010</xref>), the ability of miRNAs to target the TGF-β1 pathway at multiple specific sites may suggest a more effective and dynamic modulation of TGF-β1 effects than simple overexpression or inhibition (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Butz et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, antagomir-mediated miRNA inhibition may allow more context-specific TGF-β1 pathway modulation and may be a promising countermeasure for spaceflight applications as well.</p>
              <p id="P41">The interactions between the proposed miRNA candidates and TGF-β1 have important consequences for inflammation during different stages of spaceflight, particularly during landing. miR-145 and miR-146a, which are both associated with a pro-inflammatory response (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Tahamtan et al., 2018</xref>), have been found to be increased during landing (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Capri et al., 2019</xref>). miR-21, which is involved in the resolution of inflammation (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Tahamtan et al., 2018</xref>), has been found to be decreased during spaceflight (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Makedonas et al., 2018</xref>) and increased during landing (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Capri et al., 2019</xref>). Changes in these miRNAs during different stages of spaceflight likely contribute to the overall dysregulation of inflammation, which may persist long after astronauts return to Earth (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>)</p>
              <p id="P42">In general, miRNAs have yet to be studied extensively in the context of space biology. Previous rodent and human spaceflight (LEO) experiments that specifically examined miRNAs have been limited to <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular models (human fibroblasts and leukocytes), though some miRNAs (miR-34, miR-21, let-7a, and let-7c) identified in those studies do overlap with our proposed spaceflight signature (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Simulated microgravity studies in humans undergoing 21-day bedrest have also reported let-7a, let-7c, miR-25, miR-125b, and miR-92a from our panel (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Rullman et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, simulated deep space radiation studies in mice have implicated miR-34 and miR-125 (<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Templin et al., 2012</xref>), which we have also observed in irradiated mouse serum.</p>
              <p id="P43">Further studies will be necessary to compare spaceflight-associated miRNA effects at the individual organ, tissue, and cellular levels and to explore potential sex differences. Although we have observed strong similarities in miRNA expression in cardiac and soleus muscles (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>), the miRNA content in these organs was not sufficient to explain the systemic changes in plasma miRNAs, indicating that other organs and tissues not quantified in this study may play a major role in miRNA expression. Therefore, there is a need for a more comprehensive and unbiased assessment of all miRNA through miRNA-seq in a wide range of tissues from each of the experimental models investigated here. In addition, scRNA-seq has indicated major changes in miRNA-associated gene expression among different blood immune cell types in the human blood from the NASA Twins Study (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gertz et al., 2020</xref>). CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes are particularly likely to express and respond to miRNAs, suggesting a potential regulatory role of miRNAs on the innate immune response that is known to be dysregulated in spaceflight (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Crucian et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the demonstrated contribution of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes to increases in the circulating miRNAs, it is also possible that the miRNAs could be coming from another organ where they are more abundantly expressed. Thus, further studies will be necessary to determine the exact origin of the increased miRNAs and tissue response, such as with cell-free DNA profiling (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bezdan et al., 2020</xref>), which will be beneficial for mapping and developing effective countermeasures. Finally, the successful prevention of vascular damage through antagomir therapy in our proof-of-concept human tissue model demonstrates the need for further experiments to fully characterize antagomir therapies <italic>in vivo</italic> to understand their clinical safety and efficacy and to examine which components of the spaceflight miRNA signature make effective targets for antagomir therapies.</p>
              <p id="P44">Collectively, our results provide experimental confirmation of a previously predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beheshti et al., 2018</xref>) in multiple rodent and human models in true spaceflight, simulated gravitational changes, and simulated deep space radiation. We also demonstrate the potential for preventing biological damage by strategic inhibition of specific miRNAs with antagomirs. The immediate impact of this study is the first step toward developing a systemic miRNA signature as a novel space biology research metric for assessing spaceflight-induced damage in astronauts and animal models of true spaceflight as well as ground analogs, while its expected long-term outcome is revealing new avenues for spaceflight countermeasure development that modulates systemic effects rather than isolated organ damage.</p>

Forty 16-week old male C57BL/6J (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) mice were divided into four equal groups: sham, irradiated (IR), hindlimb unloaded (HU), or HU + IR. Mice were given sham or 2Gy of gamma (<sup>137</sup>Cs) irradiation, on day 3 of normal loading or HU, and were sacrificed on day 14.</p>
                    <p id="P50">Animals assigned to the HU group were suspended with traction tape based on previously established procedures (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998</xref>). The room was maintained at an average 73.3°F, 31% humidity, 12-hour light/dark cycle, with food and water provided <italic>ad libitum.</italic> Animal weights were monitored throughout the duration of the experiment to assess health of the mice. The NASA Ames Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all procedures. All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All animals were individually housed.</p>
                    <p id="P51">At 16 weeks of age, mice were exposed to 2 Gy gamma total body irradiation (<sup>137</sup>Cs at 0.83 Gy/min, JL Shepherd Mark I, San Gabriel, CA). For this treatment, mice were housed individually in a custom animal holding cage, maintaining HU mice in a head-down position. Mice were placed in the irradiator chamber and exposed to total body irradiation. The unloading of mice was maintained during irradiation by custom small HU cages. Sham-irradiated controls were handled similarly and placed in the irradiation chamber with the radiation source turned off.</p>
                    <p id="P52">Additional mouse serum was obtained from Dr. Yasaman Shirazi from a simulated microgravity and radiation study (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Eighty 16-week old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratory Maine, BNL protocol Globus 2015 #481) were divided into seven groups: sham (n = 14), 1Gy proton irradiation (<sup>1</sup>H, 150 MeV/n, LET ~0.52 KeV/um) (n = 9), 1Gy iron (<sup>56</sup>Fe, 600 MeV/n, LET ~175 KeV/um) irradiation (n = 9), 2Gy iron irradiation (n = 6), 1Gy mixed iron and proton irradiation (<sup>1</sup>H/<sup>56</sup>Fe/<sup>1</sup>H at 25/50/25cGy) (n = 14), hindlimb unloaded (HU) (n = 14), and HU+1Gy mixed iron and proton irradiation (n = 14). Total body irradiations were carried out at NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on conscious mice with 600 MeV/n <sup>56</sup>Fe (1 Gy), 150 MeV/n <sup>1</sup>H (1Gy), or mixed beam (<sup>1</sup>H/<sup>56</sup>Fe/<sup>1</sup>H at 25/50/25cGy), maintaining respective hindlimb unloading (HU) or normal loading (NL) conditions.

                    <p id="P53">For both the above simulated microgravity and radiation studies, serum was isolated from blood draws from the vena cava of the mice. In order to prevent hemolysis from interfering in the results, the following protocol was uniformly conducted for all serum isolations: the blood was placed in a 4mL EDTA coated blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer Lavender K2-EDTA Cat# 367861) and kept at room temperature for 30 mins to allow for clotting. Then, the tubes were centrifuged at 2000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C followed by immediate freezing of the aliquots at −80°C. Samples were always mixed gently to prevent hemolysis.</p>

                    <p id="P54">Partial weight bearing rat serum was donated by Dr. Marie Mortreux and Dr. Seward Rutkove from a previous study. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 40 adult male Wistar rats (14 weeks of age at baseline, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were assigned to 1 of 5 groups to ensure equal distribution of the body weights at baseline (428.3 ± 5.2g). Animals were assigned to either normal loading without apparatus (PWB100 N), normal loading with full harness (PWB100 FH), 70% of normal loading (PWB70), 40% of normal loading (PWB40), or 20% of normal loading (PWB20) for 28 consecutive days. Partial weight-bearing (PWB) was performed in custom cages using a quadrupedal unloading composed of a forelimb jacket and a pelvic harness and extensively described elsewhere (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Mortreux et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
                    <p id="P55">Across our 28-day study, the only significant difference between the NH and FH control groups was observed in weight gain where the 100% gravity NH group gained significantly more weight than the 100% gravity FH group. The weight gain was also associated with a slightly (but not significant) increased daily food intake that did not result in a different cumulative food intake throughout our study. The device did not exert any pressure nor prevented the animals from moving freely in their cage.</p>

                    <p id="P58">15-week ± 3-day old, <italic>C57BL/6J</italic> wild-type (<italic>Wt</italic>) female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a standard 12:12h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for 1-week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given <italic>ad libitum</italic>, and standard bedding was changed once per week. Mice were cage acclimated (n = 10 mice per group; 2 mice per cage to maintain social interaction) 3-days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, see details below). Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO<sub>2</sub> overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5 M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000xg for 15 minutes. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for −80°C storage. A 100 μL aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at −80°C for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1x RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by flow cytometric preparation and analyses, as describe below. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at −80°C. Body weight tracking was performed on days −3, 0, 7 and 14.</p>
                    <p id="P59">Hindlimb unloading (HU) was performed using the adjusted Morey-Holton method for social housing (n = 2 per cage) (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Tahimic et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, mice were suspended from the tail using non-invasive traction tape attached to an adjustable pulley mounted on the top of a standard rodent cage. The adjustable nature of the device allows the user to position the animal in a head-down position (approximately 30° to the horizon) once attached. The crossbar height, lateral crossbar position, and chain length are adjustable. The pulley is free to move along the crossbar that spans the length of the top of the cage enabling the mouse to navigate freely on one half of the cage using its forepaws and to interact with the second mouse in the cage, without enabling ambulation of the limbs. Individual food and water sources are provided to each mouse and replaced daily. Control mice were housed in identical cages with normal ambulation.</p>
                    <p id="P60">On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; simplified GCR sim (0.5 Gy), SPE (1 Gy), Gamma (5 Gy) and Sham control (0 Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by a NASA consensus formula that consists of 5 ions: protons at 1000 MeV, <sup>28</sup>Si at 600 MeV/n, <sup>4</sup>He at 250 MeV/n, <sup>16</sup>O at 350 MeV/n, <sup>56</sup>Fe at 600 MeV/n, and protons at 250 MeV. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25 minutes instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. Further, GCR sim is a mixture of high and low LET ions in a ratio of 15% to 85%, respectfully. To simulate SPE, we used a total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. For all irradiations a 60x60 beam was utilized at NSRL. For radiation dose equivalence and biological reference, we used 5 Gy gamma irradiation with the cesium resource available at BNL, in the absence of HU due to resource limitations. Sham controls were treated similar to GCR/SPE irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simualtion, i.e., 25 minutes.</p>

This mixture is the simplified version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et al., 2020</xref>). The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of radiation although high LET ions generally have a greater RBE.</p>

                  <p id="P66">The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control.</p>
                  <p id="P67">Blood samples were collected into 4mL CPT tubes (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800 X g for 20 minutes at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at 4°C until processing (average of 35-37 hours after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at −80°C.</p>
                  <p id="P68">Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: <bold>1.</bold> plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long term storage at −80°C. <bold>2.</bold> The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. 0.5 million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight samples, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at −80°C until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (QIAGEN Cat# 1053393), flash frozen and stored at −80°C until use.</p>

                  <title>Accounting for Hemolysis in Samples</title>
                  <p id="P69">Although hemolysis is unavoidable for blood/serum samples obtained from <italic>in vivo</italic> studies similar to what is described throughout this manuscript, we believe that we have accounted for this to the best to our ability for our analysis. There are many papers discussing this topic and impact on circulating miRNAs with the conclusions from these papers stating that for <italic>in vivo</italic> samples hemolysis can’t be avoided but procedures can be done to reduce the effects dramatically (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Blondal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Pizzamiglio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Poel et al., 2018</xref>). Due the constraints for space biology experiments, the main step to reduce hemolysis variations for miRNAs is by handling all the samples identically. Both the controls and all other samples were handled under the exact same conditions throughout the manuscript. So if miRNAs levels would have been altered due to hemolyzed blood, then all miRNA levels would have been altered the same way between our comparisons. In fact in the negative controls all the miRNAs from our spaceflight signature are either nonexistent or at extremely low levels compared to samples under experimental conditions. This indicated that although it has been reported that hemolysis will alter miRNAs levels for all samples (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Pizzamiglio et al., 2017</xref>), the levels of the miRNAs should have been altered identically in our controls and experimental conditions, allowing for reduced variability between results.</p>

Next, samples were mixed with a 1:20 dilution of the generated cDNA with the BioRad QX200 ddPCR Evagreen Supermix (Cat# 1864034) and the appropriate miRNA primers from miRCURY LNA miRNA PCR Assays (QIAGEN). BioRad QX200 Automated Droplet Generator (Cat# 1864101) was used to create emulsion droplets. With the C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler with 96–Deep Well Reaction Module (Bio-Rad) the following PCR reaction was used for all the primers: 1 cycle 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 58°C for 1 min (the annealing temperature can change depending on the primer), 1 cycle of 4°C for 5 min, and 1 cycle of 90°C for 5 min. Not all miRNA primers sets for ddPCR will have the same annealing temperature, so optimizing the annealing temperature is required for each primer set.

Finally, the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) quantified the amount of miRNA for each primer set per sample. QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad) generated the data for each primer set and sample. The same threshold setting was used for all samples per primer set. The concentration (miRNA copies/μl) value generated by QuantaSoft was converted to miRNA copies/ng of serum. These values were used for all miRNA analysis. For all analysis the miRNA concentrations were log<sub>2</sub>(x+1) transformed to allow for easy comparison between miRNAs and samples.</p>
