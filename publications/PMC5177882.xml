              <abstract>
                <p>Bone loss is a serious problem in spaceflight; however, the initial action of microgravity has not been identified. To examine this action, we performed live-imaging of animals during a space mission followed by transcriptome analysis using medaka transgenic lines expressing osteoblast and osteoclast-specific promoter-driven GFP and DsRed. In live-imaging for osteoblasts, the intensity of <italic>osterix</italic>- or <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-DsRed fluorescence in pharyngeal bones was significantly enhanced 1 day after launch; and this enhancement continued for 8 or 5 days. In osteoclasts, the signals of <italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP and <italic>MMP9</italic>-DsRed were highly increased at days 4 and 6 after launch in flight. HiSeq from pharyngeal bones of juvenile fish at day 2 after launch showed up-regulation of 2 osteoblast- and 3 osteoclast- related genes. Gene ontology analysis for the whole-body showed that transcription of genes in the category “nucleus” was significantly enhanced; particularly, transcription-regulators were more up-regulated at day 2 than at day 6. Lastly, we identified 5 genes, <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>jun-B-like</italic>, <italic>pai-1</italic>, <italic>ddit4</italic> and <italic>tsc22d3</italic>, which were up-regulated commonly in the whole-body at days 2 and 6, and in the pharyngeal bone at day 2. Our results suggested that exposure to microgravity immediately induced dynamic alteration of gene expression levels in osteoblasts and osteoclasts.</p>

          <body>
            <p>In the animal body, various cellular stimuli such as heat shock<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, oxidative<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and hypoxic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> stresses have been studied attentively. In spaceflight, when gravitational alteration occurs rapidly with the shift to microgravity, changes in fluid shift and blood pressure quickly take place in the human body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, leading to hemodynamic adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and alteration of vasoreactivity, accompanied by up-regulation of the NO/cGMP pathway, as was found in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. These responses to the extreme change in gravity continuously happen at the whole-body level; however, the molecular mechanisms of such responses to “microgravitational stress” remain unclear.</p>
            <p>Bone loss in astronauts, which is one of severe health problems, is observed in a spaceflight lasting for a few months, which loss is reminiscent of that for senile osteoporosis on the ground. It is recognized that understanding the potential action of this microgravity environment toward bone loss should contribute to progress in the fields related to the effect of mechanical stress on bone, as well as to clinical application for osteoporosis. To investigate the mechanism of bone loss during spaceflight, it is important to study the initial response immediately after the initial exposure to microgravity, because this response represents the trigger for bone loss. As to symptoms that appear early in orbit, the loss of calcium starts at least 10 days after launch<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>; and the assessment of bone quality revealed a loss of bone in short-duration spaceflight for 20 days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. These reports suggest that osteoblasts and osteoclasts undergo changes immediately after launch. In fact, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments conducted during a short-term parabolic flight showed changes in gene expression and cellular cytoskeleton in human chondrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, the nature of the initial response <italic>in vivo</italic> to microgravity in bone tissues is unclear.</p>
            <p>One way to answer this question is to perform animal experiments at the ISS (International Space Station). In a previous study, we found that in skeletogenesis of the vertebral body and pharyngeal bone in medaka, their osteoblasts and osteoclasts revealed properties similar to those of their mammalian counterparts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. In osteoblast differentiation, osterix is a typical marker of early osteoblasts; and osteocalcin, one of late osteoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, whereas TRAP (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase), cathepsin K, and MMP9 are markers of osteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In medaka as in mammals these cells are differentiated from TRAP, cathepsin K, and MMP9-positive mononuclear cells into multinuclear osteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Furthermore, the <italic>c-fms</italic> (the receptor of M-CSF)-deficient zebrafish shows a reduced number of osteoclasts, resulting in a bone modeling defect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, which finding indicates the essential function of M-CSF and <italic>c-fms</italic> in fish as well as in mammals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Moreover, RANKL, the essential osteoclast differentiation factor expressed in osteoblasts, is common between mammals and medaka fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. All evidence taken together indicates that the basic molecular mechanism underlying the differentiation of osteoclasts is common between mammals and fish and that the interaction of these cells with osteoblasts plays a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation in medaka as well. To identify osteoblasts and osteoclasts <italic>in-vivo</italic>, we previously developed a medaka <italic>osterix</italic> promoter-DsRed transgenic line for the visualization of osteoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and a medaka <italic>TRAP</italic> promoter-GFP transgenic line for that of osteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Finally, we established a double transgenic line of <italic>osterix</italic>-DsRed and <italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> to examine the cooperation between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the same animal. In the analysis of pharyngeal bones, by using this double transgenic line we showed the important role of osteoblasts for controlling osteoclasts to modify the attachment bone during tooth replacement in medaka pharyngeal teeth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The row of attachment bones is resorbed at the anterior side where most developed functional teeth are located, and generated at the posterior side where teeth are newly erupting, which actions cause continuous tooth replacement. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are located at attachment bones separately, with mature osteoclasts being localized at the resorbing side and osteoblasts gathered at the generating side.</p>
            <p>When medaka fish at 6 weeks after hatching were launched to the ISS in 2012 and reared there for 2 months, activation of osteoclasts together with bone loss occurred in the flight fish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In that study, to examine the alteration of gene expression early in orbit, we preserved specimens with RNAlater at days 2 and 6 after launch. Another way to study growing tissues under microgravity in space is to perform experiments using three-dimensional cultures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>; however, such experiments have not yet been performed at the ISS. In our present study, to examine the early effects of microgravity on bone cells, we embedded transgenic medaka larvae in a gel for a live-imaging study in space in 2014, and observed signals by fluorescence microscopy at the ISS via remote operation from Tsukuba Space Center. For this experiment, we utilized 4 different double medaka transgenic lines and, in particular, investigated up-regulation of fluorescent signals of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in these double transgenic lines as an important way to study osteoblast-osteoclast interaction under microgravity.</p>
            <p>In addition, we examined the pattern of gene expression in these transgenic fish by transcriptome analysis. HiSeq analysis of the pharyngeal bones showed the enhanced expression of osteoblast- and osteoclast-related genes. Furthermore, GO (gene ontology) analysis showed the up-regulation of AP-1-, GR- and TGF-β-related genes that coincided with osteoclast activation. Our results about live-imaging and transcriptome analysis may prompt the establishment of a new field in gravitational biology.</p>

                <title>Enhancement of osteoblast signals under microgravity</title>
                <p>To find alteration of signal intensity and area of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, we observed the fluorescent signals in living medaka for 8 days at the ISS as shown in Methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>. Twelve larvae at stage 39 were embedded in “medaka chambers” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), in which live larvae in a gel were covered with a semipermeable membrane. Pharyngeal bones, around which many osteoblasts and osteoclasts were localized, were clearly observed from the ventral side (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). This ventral side was oriented toward the glass plate for observation via an objective lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). For capturing images by use of a 20x lens, we carried out observation in 3 steps, because the posture of the living larvae was constantly changing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The experimental schedule for live-imaging of the 4 double transgenic lines, <italic>osterix</italic>-DsRed/<italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP, <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-DsRed/<italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP, <italic>MMP9</italic>-DsRed/<italic>RANKL</italic>-GFP, and <italic>cox2</italic>-GFP/<italic>TRAP</italic>-DsRed during 8 days in flight and on the ground is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. To perform the imaging analyses for both the flight and ground samples under the same conditions, we manipulated both fluorescence microscopes, one at ISS and the other on the ground at the same gain value and the same appropriate exposure time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Firstly, the capture images of DsRed in the <italic>osterix</italic>-DsRed/<italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP line, which fluorescence visualizes the early stage of osteoblasts, revealed high expression in the flight group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a–f</xref>). To examine the effect of microgravity on the whole-body, we observed overall this transgenic medaka, and found that the intensity of the fluorescent signals was enhanced in the whole-body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2g,h</xref>). Then, we focused on the pharyngeal bone region, in which bone turnover is high and sensitive to microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and observed ground and flight samples at high magnification with a 20x lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) to examine the details of fluorescent signals in osteoblasts. When the fluorescent signal was measured in the pharyngeal bone region including the cleithrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>), the results revealed that in the flight group, this intensity was increased compared with that in the ground group over the 8-day observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). The signal-positive area was also increased about 8.0 fold or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Next, to examine the late stage of osteoblasts, we measured the intensity and area of DsRed signals in the <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-DsRed/<italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP line and found a large increase in intensity in the flight group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e–h</xref>); however, no statistically significant increase in area was found (data not shown). To remove any possibility of a contribution of hypergravity exerted during the launch into space to the level of fluorescent signals, we performed a hypergravity experiment, and the results showed no significant alteration of signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This result suggested that the hypergravity occurring at launch seems to have had no detectable effect on the <italic>osterix</italic>-DsRed signals.</p>

                <p>The interaction of osteoblasts and osteoclasts is important for bone remodeling.

Furthermore, we confirmed the localization of GFP and DsRed signals in the pharyngeal bone region in flight medaka by performing three-dimensional (3D) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5k–n</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5k</xref> shows a 3D image of the distribution of the fluorescent proteins.

                <p>To examine the alteration of gene expression levels early in orbit, we focused on the common up- and down-regulated genes in the whole-body at days 2 and 6 after launch. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on total RNAs extracted from the whole-body medaka. We examined over 20,130 (90.3%) and 21,062 (94.5%) expressed genes at days 2 and 6, respectively. With a false-discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;=0.2, 2,958 up-regulated (S &gt; G) genes (13.3% of all genes) and 3,631 down-regulated (S &lt; G) genes (16.3% of all genes) were shown to be differentially expressed genes (DEG) by the RNA-Seq analysis. The number of common genes for up- and down-regulation between days 2 and 6 was 105 and 48, respectively, and categorized according to the following classification: Molecular function, Biological process, and Cellular component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> shows the ratio of enriched GO annotations for up- and down-regulated genes in the “<italic>cellular component</italic>” in the GO domain.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Under microgravity, there are several changes in the animal body, such as fluid shift, increase in blood pressure, and dizziness. In particular, bone mineral density is decreased under microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>; but it is unclear how osteoblasts or osteoclasts respond early in orbit. In spaceflight, there are 2 phases in the adaptation to a specified environment under microgravity; one is the initial extreme alteration from ground 1 G to μG early in orbit, and the other is the adaptation to chronic stress during long-term flight. It is important to understand the initial response; however, previous studies were performed either <italic>in vitro</italic> or by using artificial microgravity. In our present study, we took 2 approaches, i.e., live imaging and transcriptome analysis, to examine the initial response to microgravity. Especially, the live-imaging analysis is useful to examine real-time alterations of cells under microgravity. We observed living animals (medaka) at the ISS for the first time via remote operation from Tsukuba Space Center, and found by live-imaging that the fluorescent signals of osteoblasts as well as those of osteoclasts were significantly increased over those for the ground control. In the whole-body fish, the <italic>osterix</italic>-DsRed and <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-DsRed signals in osteoblasts were increased in intensity, indicating that osteoblasts were directly affected by microgravity regardless of osteoclast commitment.</p>
              <p>We propose the following possible mechanism for the up-regulation of <italic>osterix</italic>, <italic>osteocalcin</italic>, <italic>TRAP</italic>, and <italic>MMP9</italic> genes under microgravity: Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are located on bones, which are most sensitive to gravity alteration because they are the tissue with the highest density in the body. Bone-specific genes such as <italic>osterix</italic> and <italic>osteocalcin</italic> may have properties affording a response to gravity. Both <italic>osterix</italic> and <italic>osteocalcin</italic> transcription was up-regulated at the same time: day 1 as shown in the fluorescent intensity. This is different from normal osteoblast differentiation in which <italic>osterix</italic> and <italic>osteocalcin</italic> expressions appear at the early and the later stage, respectively, during osteoblast differentiation. At the ISS, this disorder of osteoblasts causes activation of osteoclasts, or osteoclasts may respond directly to the gravity alteration in a different manner, resulting in enhanced expression of <italic>TRAP</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic> genes.</p>
              <p>The transcriptome analysis of pharyngeal bones showed significant up-regulation of 2 osteoblast-related genes and 3 osteoclast-related genes in the flight group: <italic>col10a1</italic> and <italic>osteocalcin</italic> and for the former and <italic>acp5 (TRAP)</italic>, <italic>cathepsin</italic>, and <italic>MMP9</italic> for the latter. Enhanced gene expression of <italic>osteocalcin</italic>, <italic>TRAP</italic>, and <italic>MMP9</italic> was consistent with the results of the live-imaging study.</p>
              <p>Gene ontology analysis using mRNAs from the whole-body fish at days 2 and 6 showed significant up-regulation of genes involved in “nucleus regulation”. Consistently, it has been reported that in parabolic flight experiments performed <italic>in vitro</italic>, unexpected effects on cells are observed, mainly on molecules related to transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. It is considered that cells adapt to a change (microgravity) by rearranging their transcriptional apparatus to counteract alterations in gene expressions as a reaction to a stimulus under microgravity. Among our findings, 2 of them were especially important. Firstly, of the genes involved in regulation of the nucleus, we found that 5 of the 23 nucleus-related genes selected in the whole-body transcriptome analysis were related to osteoblast or osteoclast function, and were up-regulated to a greater extent at day 2 than at day 6. Regarding these 5 genes, <italic>klf9</italic> and <italic>klf2</italic> are regulated in the macrophage network via the glucocorticoid receptor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <italic>foxa3</italic> is a crucial regulator of hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, <italic>maf</italic> promotes osteoblast differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, and <italic>CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta</italic> is involved in inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Secondly, we found that the MCM (minichromosome maintenance complex) family, which is the DNA helicase complex required for DNA replication, was up-regulated at day 6. Especially, <italic>mcm3</italic> in osteoblasts was reported to be up-regulated by irradiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cells immediately produce the necessary transcription factors and remodel the chromatin structure in their nucleus. Interestingly, 2 transcription factor genes, <italic>gadd45</italic> and <italic>klf2</italic>, were reportedly up-regulated under hypergravity in the another fish model, zebrafish<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>; and these 2 genes were also up-regulated under microgravity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>jun-B-like</italic>, and <italic>jun dimerization protein 2-like</italic> were also up-regulated under microgravity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>); and in a clinorotation study, which is commonly used to compensate for the unilateral effect of gravity, FOS-JUN transcription factors were regulated by the GADD45B factor for their global expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Taken together, these findings indicate that there may exist a general mechanism against the gravity.</p>
              <p>In the analysis of commonly up-regulated genes in the whole-body fish at days 2 and 6, and in pharyngeal bones at day 2, we found that 5 of them, i.e., <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>jun-B-like</italic>, <italic>pai-1</italic>, <italic>ddit4,</italic> and <italic>tsc22d3</italic>, were commonly up-regulated. c-Fos and jun-b are immediate early-response genes that include response to alteration of gravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>; and among the members of the jun family, junB is quickly activated, as was shown in a clinostat experiment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. This jun member is a part of the inducible transcription factor complex AP-1, which is a positive regulator for controlling the formation of primary osteoblasts and osteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Furthermore, TGF-β induces pai-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and tsc22<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Omata <italic>et al</italic>. reported that c-fos and Smads can activate osteoclasts, in which Smads are involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, a pathway potentially activated by mechanical stress.</p>
              <p>Previous studies showed that glucocorticoid induces pai-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, ddit4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>, and tsc22d3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and that the transcription factor AP1 regulates glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding at the chromatin level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. GRs are possibly involved in osteoclast activation, because GR and AP-1 synergistically activate transcription, in which AP-1 guides GR binding. Pai-1 and Tsc22d3 are activated by the combination of TGF-β and GR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, whereas ddit4 is enhanced by GR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. During spaceflight, blood pressure changes early in orbit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. It is also known that the stress of elevated blood pressure produces nitric oxide (NO)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> or NO reduces blood pressure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Recently, it was shown that GR and NO have a synergistic function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>; and interestingly, it was reported that stimulation by NO induces <italic>tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>ddit4</italic> and <italic>klf2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>, and that preeclamptic plasma down-regulates <italic>klf9</italic>, <italic>tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>cebpb</italic>, <italic>ddit4</italic> and <italic>jdp2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. In our results, expressions of these genes were altered under microgravity, which thus suggests that NO-GR signaling is related to the “microgravitational stress”. Taken together, available data indicate that the GR is the main molecule involved in the effect of microgravity on cells, consistent with our observations of activation of GRs in medaka fish reared long-term in the ISS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Finally, to clarify the GR action under microgravity, further analyses are required. We plan to further investigate the function of these genes in our next space experiment.</p>

In 2014, the fluorescent signals from 24 larvae fish of 4 double transgenic lines were observed at the ISS for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging under microgravity.</p>
                <p>The experiments were performed in accordance with policies and protocols approved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In the experiment at the ISS in 2012, at days 2 and 6 after launch, medaka fish were transported into the “Fish Fixation Apparatus” for analysis of mRNA expression levels. The buffer used in the Fish Fixation Apparatus was RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). Specimens were frozen and stored at −95 °C for later mRNA analyses. These specimens were maintained at −95 °C and transported from NASA to Japan.</p>
                <p>In the next experiment, medaka larvae were placed in the “Medaka Chamber” and flown on the Soyuz flight TMA-10M (Roscosmos, Russia) in 2014. After arrival at KIBO, which is the space laboratory of Japan in the International Space Station (ISS), the medaka chambers were set under a fluorescence microscope for live imaging for 8 days.</p>

                <title>Embedding of medaka larvae for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging</title>
                <p>Cab, an inbred wild-type strain of the medaka (O. latipes), was used throughout this study. Fish were kept under a photoperiod of 14 h light/10 h darkness at 28 °C. Eggs were obtained and kept at 25–28 °C after collection. After hatching at day 9, larvae were embedded in Mebiol Gel (Mebiol Inc). Mebiol Gel has a unique property; i.e., it is a liquid at a low temperature, but turns into a gel upon being warmed up.</p>
                <p>For preparation of the gel solution, 0.5 ppm methylene blue in water including 1% streptomycin and 0.57% penicillin was filtered, after which 12 ml of the solution was added to the Mebiol Gel container. For dissolution, the containers were shaken for 2 days at 4 °C.</p>
                <p>Hatching larvae were incubated on ice for 10 minutes for anesthesia, and 12 larvae were lined up on the glass plate of a chamber. Promptly, the chamber was filled with 2.1 ml of gel solution, after which its upper side was covered with a semipermeable membrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, pharyngeal bones were clearly observed from the ventral side. In this experiment, the ventral side was oriented toward the glass plate for observation via an objective lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
                <p>Medaka chamber (#1) contained <italic>osterix</italic>-DsRed/<italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP (n = 10) and <italic>RANKL</italic>-GFP/<italic>MMP9</italic>-DsRed (n = 2); and Medaka chamber (#2), <italic>RANKL</italic>-GFP/<italic>MMP9</italic>-DsRed (n = 3), <italic>osteocalcin</italic>-DsRed/<italic>TRAP</italic>-GFP (n = 5), and <italic>cox2</italic>-GFP/<italic>TRAP</italic>-DsRed (n = 4). Three chambers including backup samples were prepared for #1 and #2, respectively.</p>
                <p>The experiment for the ground control was carried out under the same conditions as used for the flight group.</p>

                <title>Microscope Observation System</title>
                <p>The Microscope Observation System consisted of a microscope, a power supply, and the control unit containing a VGA-NTSC converter and an Experiment Laptop Terminal (ELT). This system was used to conduct fluorescence observations and also supported live imaging of medaka transgenic lines. We manipulated this system under the same measurement conditions both at ISS and on the ground. During the experiment at the ISS, the crew set up the medaka sample at the ISS, and remote observations and operations were conducted by command from Earth via the ELT (Experiment Laptop Terminal). The recorded image files were transferred back to Earth. The microscope used was an inverted vertical illumination fluorescence microscope (DMI6000B, Leica Microsystems) partially modified to fit the space environment. All microscope operations on the stage, the object lens revolver, the fluorescence filter turret, and the capacitor were controlled electrically<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.</p>

                <title>Live imaging of medaka fish</title>
                <p>Twelve larvae at stage 39 were embedded in one “Medaka Chamber” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), where larvae in Mebiol gel (Mebiol Inc.) were covered with a gas-permeable membrane to remain alive. The temperature for this experiment was maintained between 19–23 °C. The chambers including fish larvae were shaded all day. The numbers of fish in the flight and ground groups are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. The growth of fish in the flight group was similar to that of those in the ground group, and the larvae in both conditions were at stage 39 when they were embedded in the gel.</p>
                <p>The microscope used was a modified fluorescence microscope (DMI 6000B, Leica Microscope Systems Co.), which was controlled by a specialized software. This software was able to receive a command from the ground control and execute the microscope’s actions continuously by using a batch process. Fluorescent signals were observed with the filter set and the LED light source optimized for each signal. Collection of images of live larvae in random spatial distribution was performed in 3 steps. In the first step, the XY coordinates of each larva was set approximately by using a 5x objective lens. In the second step, these coordinates were narrowed down; and the Z coordinate was set within the limits of 1000 μm by using a 10x objective lens. The interval of all continuous images was 100 μm in the head region. In the final step, the tack-sharp Z-stack images within the limits of 500 μm were captured by using a 20x lens. The interval of all continuous images was 5 μm in the pharyngeal bone region. These steps were summarized in “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>”.</p>
                <p>In the ground control group, images were captured under the same conditions as used for the flight group, and the temperature was controlled at around 21 °C. We measured fluorescent signals using the same time course on the ground and in the flight. We confirmed that there was no significant difference in the calibration of the microscope by using the background luminance caused by the excitation light for both GFP and DsRed fluorescence. We checked this calibration value by using <italic>cox-2-GFP</italic> signals at the head of the transgenic line, which showed the constitutive signals and found a similar level of signals in both ISS and the ground (data not shown).</p>

                <p>The intensity and area of GFP and DsRed signals were calculated by use of ImageJ software (ImageJ). The fluorescent signal area was selected by the process <italic>Image</italic>/<italic>Adjust</italic>/<italic>Threshold</italic> in ImageJ. Adjustment of the parameter in “<italic>Threshold</italic>” shows the adequate selected area as a “red region” on the window of ImageJ. Next, the intensity and the area were calculated by the process <italic>Analyze</italic>/<italic>Measure</italic> (“<italic>Limit to threshold</italic>” is selected in “<italic>Set Measurements</italic>”). The fluorescent signal area was cropped by “<italic>Polygon sections”</italic> when necessary. The captured images during flight were noised as small spots by cosmic rays. These small spots were canceled by removal of outliers (radius: 2.0 pixels, threshold: 50, and bright outliers). The range of each observation was adjusted enough to contain the fluorescence of tissues. The observation of pharyngeal bones in the flight samples covered 101 slices, and that of the ground control, about 55 slices, by focus adjustment with manual operation for the minimum range. The images were stacked in a single file. As described above, we selected the fluorescent signal area and calculated it with the process, <italic>Analyze</italic>/<italic>Histogram,</italic> by the measurement of both “area” and “intensity” for all images, which was shown as a stacked file.</p>

Step 1: At first, XY coordinate was created by using a 5x objective lens. The red arrows show the direction of capture on the XY plane. The observed objects were selected. Step 2: XY coordinates were corrected, and the Z coordinate was created by using the 10x objective lens. The blue crosses show the observed objects whose ventral side was oriented toward the glass plate for observation via an objective lens; and red arrows, the direction of capturing Z-axis with a width of 1000 μm. Step 3: Clear fluorescent images were captured by using a 20x objective lens with a width of 500 μm. The steps are summarized in the table at the bottom of Fig. 1.</p>
