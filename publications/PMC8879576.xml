                <p>Microgravity impairs tissue organization and critical pathways involved in the cell–microenvironment interplay, where fibroblasts have a critical role. We exposed dermal fibroblasts to simulated microgravity by means of a Random Positioning Machine (RPM), a device that reproduces conditions of weightlessness. Molecular and structural changes were analyzed and compared to control samples growing in a normal gravity field. Simulated microgravity impairs fibroblast conversion into myofibroblast and inhibits their migratory properties. Consequently, the normal interplay between fibroblasts and keratinocytes were remarkably altered in 3D co-culture experiments, giving rise to several ultra-structural abnormalities. Such phenotypic changes are associated with down-regulation of α-SMA that translocate in the nucleoplasm, altogether with the concomitant modification of the actin-vinculin apparatus. Noticeably, the stress associated with weightlessness induced oxidative damage, which seemed to concur with such modifications. These findings disclose new opportunities to establish antioxidant strategies that counteract the microgravity-induced disruptive effects on fibroblasts and tissue organization.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Research in space biomedicine is regaining momentum as space agencies, both in the USA and Europe, plan an ambitious program called <italic toggle="yes">ARTEMIS</italic>. Its primary goal is to send humans back to the Moon by 2025 [<xref rid="B1-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, a number of biomedical threats actually challenge the sustainability of prolonged exposure to the outer space environment [<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cosmic rays, radiation, disruption of biological rhythms, and microgravity can cause adverse effects upon several physiological functions, thus impairing the immune system, bone density, as well as neurological and cardiovascular function [<xref rid="B3-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Specifically, weightlessness can impair human physiology by acting at the systemic level and by affecting a bewildering number of critical and genomic pathways within cells and tissues [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several lines of evidence suggest that immune, muscular, bone, breast, and many other cells significantly change their morphology and dynamical behavior during microgravity exposure [<xref rid="B8-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is worth noting that epithelial cells—in both normal and pathological conditions—dynamically interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and a wide array of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts. Those interactions play a critical role in several processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, tissue repair (wound healing), fibrosis, and cancer transformation, ultimately driving cells toward distinct phenotypic fates [<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, fibroblast–epithelial interactions modulate tissue repair, homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling, specifically through the mechanotransduction of physical stimuli and the modification of the ECM composition, thus participating in the morphology of epithelial cells and tissues [<xref rid="B11-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Under real microgravity conditions, human fibroblast samples cultured during space flight show increased levels of collagen synthesis [<xref rid="B12-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Instead, in simulated weightlessness—obtained through specific devices like the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) [<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]—fibroblasts undergo several cytoskeleton (CSK) and functional changes, including reduced levels of E-cadherin, α-SMA, and several ECM components [<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, a model study of collagen-based three-dimensional matrices showed that fibroblast differentiation and matrix remodeling are impaired in microgravity [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Noticeably, the microgravity molds the fibroblast’s shape and orientation, disrupting cell alignment and decreasing a cell’s adherence to the substrate [<xref rid="B17-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that those effects can impair the fibroblast–keratinocyte interactions and their topographical distribution within the microenvironment, thus altering the overall functioning of the stroma in microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>We, therefore, investigated whether a microgravity (µG) condition affects dermal fibroblast differentiation and their dynamic interaction with collagen and keratinocytes in a co-culture system. Results showed that µG impairs fibroblast motility, invasiveness, and capability in performing an appropriate wound-healing process. Moreover, exposure to simulated weightlessness severely disrupts the physiological architecture on which the fibroblast–keratinocyte interplay relies. This suggests that µG can impair the normal homeostasis of skin tissues.</p>

                <p>In human dermal fibroblasts exposed to simulated microgravity for 24 h, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the expression of myofibroblastic markers α-SMA (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and Cofilin (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01) as compared to on-ground controls.

WB assay demonstrated a significant reduction in α-SMA quantity, even if the very relevant and unexpected finding is represented by the different distribution of that protein during the microgravity exposure. Indeed, α-SMA translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus after 24 h of µG exposure (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).

                <p>We investigated if µG exposure could impair specific cytoskeleton (CSK) targets involved in enabling cell-surface contact and displacement. Namely, actin-vinculin co-localization is mandatory to allow for cell movement and the transduction of physical forces through the mechanobiological apparatus. As forecasted, confocal microscopy of control and µG-exposed samples revealed a marked disassembly between vinculin and actin filaments at the border of the cell’s membrane and a concomitant decrease in the overall vinculin presence (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> upper panel). Further, the quantitative analysis of vinculin’s fluorescence intensity (SUM(I)) performed by Leica confocal software confirmed a significant difference between OG and RPM conditions (O.G.: 3324.87 ± 484.03 a.u. versus RPM: 889.50 ± 195.78 a.u; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Those findings—together with the impressive reduction of the filopodia/pseudopodia number—further suggest that some key effectors of cell motion are critically hampered during µG exposure. Namely, TEM analysis revealed that cell-to-cell adhesiveness was likely impaired, as suggested by the significant reduction in desmosome-like junctions of µG-exposed cells. <xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> shows the ultrastructure of fibroblasts cultured at 1 g (A) or under simulated microgravity (B). Adherent desmosome-like junctions among plasma membrane protrusions were abundant in unitary-gravity-cultured cells, while they were almost completely lacking in simulated-microgravity-exposed samples. Consequently, fibroblasts exposed to weightlessness did not form adhesive junctions, even when cell plasma membranes interacted (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>B). </p>
                <p>It is worth noting that such changes consistently reverted to normalcy after 48 h of µG conditioning. Specifically, the quantitative analysis of the fluorescent intensity of vinculin (SUM(I)) demonstrated that the amount of vinculin present in these cells did not differ significantly from that of cells maintained for 48 h under an OG condition (O.G.: 8615.25 ± 1547.09 a.u. versus RPM: 8553.75 ± 1024.38 a.u; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = n.s).

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>Gravity is a fundamental physical constraint that dramatically affects the structure and the behavior of living organisms. This has been highlighted by an impressive body of evidence gathered during the last 50 years, since the beginning of human space exploration [<xref rid="B23-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Noticeably, even mild reductions in the gravitational force can trigger the remodeling of living functions at different levels, from the macroscale (body fluids, organs, and tissues) to the nanoscale (dynamics and structure of proteins and other molecular components). Cells exposed to microgravity are profoundly affected by the physical changes occurring in this unique environment, which include loss of gravity-dependent convection, disappearance of hydrodynamic shear [<xref rid="B24-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and lack of sedimentation. Moreover, several pathways are sensitive to even mild changes in the balance between those forces that affect the morphogenetic field. According to non-equilibrium thermodynamics that govern dissipative processes, these can display unexpected behaviors, such as cytoskeleton arrangement, cell division, and mechanotransduction of physical stresses, to name a few [<xref rid="B25-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Specifically, dynamic adhesion processes between cells and their microenvironment are profoundly affected in µG, leading to bewildering modification in cellular aggregation and tissue architecture [<xref rid="B27-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Fibroblasts play a critical role in tissue homeostasis because they behave as true “transducers” of many interactions between cells and their microenvironment. Fibroblasts are active players during wound-healing processes [<xref rid="B29-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and inflammatory reactions [<xref rid="B30-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In fact, they convey several biochemical and physical cues that ultimately modify the response of the epithelial layer. Noticeably, under the stimulus of inflammatory (e.g., TGF-β release) or physical (e.g., increased stiffness) stresses, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts [<xref rid="B31-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The increased expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is instrumental in supporting the transition from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, specifically by allowing myofibroblasts to gain contractile properties and physically remodel ECM structure and composition [<xref rid="B32-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Only a few studies have investigated the performance of fibroblasts in µG conditions. Fibroblasts growing in weightlessness exhibit significant changes in collagen synthesis, cytoskeleton architecture, and ECM production (e.g., laminin and fibronectin), as well as altered growth behavior [<xref rid="B12-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is worth noting that in microgravity, several genes were either down-regulated or up-regulated [<xref rid="B33-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], while the expression of both E-cadherin and α-SMA genes were found to be significantly reduced [<xref rid="B34-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Here, we show that fibroblasts cultured in microgravity underwent several changes that impaired their differentiation into myofibroblasts. The cell cycle after 24 h of µG conditioning showed slight, albeit significant changes with an increased apoptosis rate and reduced proliferation. During this period, fibroblasts experienced significant oxidative damage (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) that was successfully rescued when GSH was added to cell cultures. Microgravity-conditioned fibroblasts were unable to mount an efficient wound-healing response (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) as their migrating properties were severely compromised (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This occurred alongside a reduced capability to degrade the surrounding microenvironment due to the diminished release of MMP (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), both in 2D as well as 3D cell culture models (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Those changes were supported by an impressive down-regulation of those molecular parameters (Fascin, α-SMA, Cofilin) and cytoskeleton-related effectors (actin and vinculin), which participate in modulating cell motility. It is worth noting that a loss of vinculin significantly impairs traction force generation and motility [<xref rid="B35-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this effect can be appreciated only in 3D matrices [<xref rid="B36-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (or in µG conditions), given that fibroblasts lacking vinculin displayed a paradoxical increase in migration rates in 2D cultures [<xref rid="B37-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Despite cell-to-cell adhesiveness being weakened, as documented by the significant lessening of desmosome-like junctions, the overall migrating capability of µG-exposed fibroblasts was impaired by the concomitant down-regulation of α-SMA. Over-expression of α-SMA is required to facilitate motility and contractility. Particularly, wound contraction takes place when a <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> expressed α-SMA is incorporated in <italic toggle="yes">stress fibers</italic> [<xref rid="B38-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In turn, the α-SMA mediated contraction plays a critical role in mechanically regulating fibroblast fate by controlling YAP/TAZ activation and, ultimately, modulating the overall transduction of physical forces [<xref rid="B39-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the reduced α-SMA expression can explain the significant impairment in the collagen gel contraction that we observed with µG-conditioned fibroblasts (<xref rid="ijms-23-02163-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). Noticeably, changes in migration and invasiveness capability were transitory, as they reverted after 72 h of µG exposure or when fibroblasts were seeded again in a normal gravity field. Yet, the observed displacement of α-SMA within the nucleoplasm represented a mark of cell phenotypic transition, and this finding could explain how non-genetic modifications can be instrumental in driving a system toward different cell states of differentiation [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>Indeed, we recorded some modifications in gene expression during an exposure to weightlessness. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the impressive phenotypic changes observed in fibroblasts can be ascribed to any genome activity fine-tuning. In fact, as previously reported, RNA sequencing has revealed minimal variation in transcriptomic of fibroblasts under µG conditions [<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while phenotypic changes in µG are most likely driven by non-genetic mechanisms acting at the system biology level and governed according to the non-equilibrium thermodynamics principles [<xref rid="B26-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Amazingly, as per our previous study [<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the fate of keratinocytes in microgravity showed an opposite trend, given that they acquired several traits pertaining to the EMT phenotype. Keratinocytes show an increased expression of EMT-related markers and the development of organoid-like structures, while losing cell-to-cell adhesions. This latter aspect is instrumental in enabling the disassembly of cell clusters and in promoting their migratory capability. Therefore, changes occurring in the motility properties of both keratinocytes and fibroblasts exposed to µG may have favored the establishment of new reciprocal relationships between cell types. Overall, these changes were instrumental in reframing the interactions among different cells and, likely, between cells and their microenvironment. This is precisely what we observed when both keratinocytes and fibroblasts were co-cultured all together in µG.</p>
              <p>We showed that µG significantly modified the way fibroblasts and keratinocytes interacted in reshaping the 3D architecture of the organoid that resulted from cell co-culture within the Matrigel. When the co-culture was exposed to µG, the normal fibroblasts–keratinocytes interplay was disrupted, and the two cell types were partitioned into distinct cell layers, with the keratinocytes in the internal core of the aggregate. On the contrary, under normal gravity conditions, fibroblasts and keratinocytes invaded the Matrigel and formed three-dimensional, regular ovoid structures in which cells were randomly distributed. This is a relevant outcome, as it suggests that µG may significantly alter the normal tissue organization, challenging the physiological function of the system, namely by modifying the way a living system responds to even physiological inputs [<xref rid="B40-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Specifically, these findings demonstrated that modifications in the surrounding microenvironment, which involve a rewiring of critical constraints (like gravity), are critical in shaping cells and tissues of three-dimensional structures.</p>
              <p>Those modifications are probably adaptive, as observed from the many changes occurring during the early period of µG exposure. However, further studies on prolonged periods of µG exposure are needed to assess if µG could represent a critical threat for living beings and the functioning of complex tissues, as well investigate the molecular pathways involved in the observed changes. Given that µG exerts distinct effects on the adhesiveness of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, it is tempting to speculate that this would influence the transduction of mechanical stimuli from the microenvironment. Impaired mechanotransduction can likely affect the crosstalk among the two cell types, their interaction with ECM, and the production of soluble factors, which, in turn, can control the reciprocal behavior of the two cell clusters [<xref rid="B41-ijms-23-02163" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>

The desktop RPM was positioned in a standard incubator. The RPM was set at an angular velocity of 60/s. Human dermal fibroblasts were seeded in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks (T25, Falcon, Becton–Dickinson Labware, FranklinLakes, NJ, USA) and were used for experiments. Before exposing the cells to the regime of microgravity, the flasks were filled completely with fresh culture medium to eliminate the presence of air bubbles and therefore decrease the effects of turbulence and shear stress during rotation. Flasks containing fibroblast sub-confluent monolayers were fixed into the RPM as close as possible to the center of the platform. The RPM and on-ground (OG) cultures were kept in the same humidified incubator at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Microgravity impairs tissue organization and critical pathways associated with several repair-related processes, including wound healing. Both tissue architecture and complex physiological functions depend on proper cooperation between cells and their microenvironment. In this setting, a critical role is supported by fibroblasts that undergo a number of cell fate transitions to acquire distinctive differentiated capabilities. Our findings show that fibroblast differentiation is severely impaired after µG exposure for short periods. Fibroblasts’ conversion into myofibroblasts is inhibited alongside their migratory and invasive properties. Consequently, the normal interplay between fibroblasts and keratinocytes in 3D co-culture experiments was remarkably altered, giving rise to abnormalities in organoid-like structures. The downregulation of α-SMA and its unexpected translocation in the nucleoplasm, which is associated with the parallel modification of the actin-vinculin apparatus, can explain why fibroblast-related contractility and mechanotransduction are remarkably modified during µG exposure. These phenotypic changes can likely be triggered by the oxidative damage enacted by the stress associated with weightlessness. There are further ongoing studies to investigate if an appropriate countermeasure—including antioxidant strategies—could help in damping microgravity-induced disruptive effects on fibroblasts and tissue organization</p>

                <p>Representative confocal images of fibroblast (green) and keratinocytes (red) co-cultured on Matrigel in normal gravitational (<bold>A</bold>) and microgravity conditions (<bold>B</bold>) for 24 h. (<bold>C</bold>,<bold>D</bold>) show the three-dimensional Leica software reconstructions. The confocal microscope analysis showed that in OG, the fibroblasts were arranged randomly with keratinocytes, while in the RPM, the fibroblasts and keratinocytes had distinct positions (scale bar 145.6 µm).</p>
