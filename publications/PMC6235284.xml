                <p>Gravitational stress occurs during space flights or certain physical activities including extreme sports, where the change in experienced gravitational acceleration can reach large magnitudes. These changes include reduction and increase in the physical forces experienced by the body and may potentially induce pathogenic alterations of physiological processes. The immune system is known to regulate most functions in the human organism and previous studies suggest an impairment of the immune function under gravitational stress. However, systematic studies aiming to investigate the effect of gravitational stress on cellular immune response in humans are lacking. Since parabolic flights are considered as feasible model to investigate a short-term impact of gravitational changes, we evaluated the influence of gravitational stress on the immune system by analyzing leukocyte numbers before and after parabolic flight maneuvers in human blood. To correct for circadian effects, samples were taken at the corresponding time points on ground the day before the flight. The parabolic flight maneuvers led to changes in numbers of different leukocyte subsets. Naïve and memory T and B cell subsets decreased under gravitational stress and lower numbers of basophils and eosinophils were observed. Only circulating neutrophils increased during the parabolic flight. The observed changes could not be attributed to stress-induced cortisol effects, since cortisol levels were not affected. Our data demonstrate that the gravitational stress by parabolic flights can affect all parts of the human immune system. Consequently, it is possible that gravitational stress can have clinically relevant impacts on the control of immune responses.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>All physiological processes including immunological mechanisms are adjusted to the gravitational field of the earth. The stability of earths gravitational field excluded evolutional adaption of biological processes to hyper- or microgravity. Gravitational changes can be associated with extreme physical forces acting on the whole organism. Rodents such as mice and rats can tolerate up to 7 g before death [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, extreme gravitational alteration can be considered as gravitational stress, which may have substantial adverse effects on physiological processes ranging from cellular and molecular dysfunctions to impaired tissue, organ, and immune functionalities. Space flights impose several changes to the experienced gravitational field, from hypergravity during takeoff and landing to near zero gravity in orbit. In fact, during short- and long-term space flights, functional immune dysregulation has been described in participating individuals [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Additionally, certain physical exercises and extreme sports—including various amusement rides, skydiving, bungee jumping, or wingsuit flying—also induce gravitational stress [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. All of these may potentially induced short- or long-term physiological adverse effects. For example, hypergravity exposed mice and rats displayed a normal occurrence of pregnancy, but an impaired reproducibility, where only a small fraction of neonates survived [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hypergravity has further been reported to result in a reduction of the mass of murine lymphoid organs such as spleen and thymus as well as the numbers of B and T cells, which could lead to immunological dysfunctions [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p>
              <p>While hypergravity can easily be mimicked by centrifugation [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], modelling microgravity is more challenging. <italic>In vitro</italic>, microgravity modelled using a Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS), show that microgravity supports the formation of bone resorbing osteoclast, which is in agreement with observations from astronauts participating in long-term space missions [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, dendritic cells cultivated in the RCCS system show reduced functionality, supporting the multifaceted effects of microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>To simulate microgravity, one accepted <italic>in vivo</italic> model is the antiorthostatic suspension [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where the animal is subjected to a head-down tilt. Mice exposed to this suspension model showed immune dysfunctions, with impairment of the respiratory burst responses in polymorphonuclear leukocytes [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, T and B cells showed an reduced proliferative response after three weeks of hind limb unloading [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Naturally, animal models can only allow limited conclusions for the potential effects of gravitational stress on the human immune system.</p>
              <p>The short-arm human centrifuge (SAHC) can be applied to investigate the effects of hypergravity on humans, and is also used to countermeasure microgravity effects during long term space flight [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there are currently no studies available, which used SAHC to investigate hypergravity effects on the human immune system.</p>
              <p>An accepted analog to study microgravity in humans is the long-duration head-down tilt bed rest [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. After 21 days of head-down bed rest, a fraction of study participants showed a decreased cytokine responses in blood stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, indicating an impaired reactivity of certain leukocytes [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Space flight is obviously the most appropriate way to study long-term microgravity effects, but remains relatively inaccessible for exploratory studies in humans. Space flight studies performed in mice and humans indicated dysfunctional immune mechanisms, which could potentially increase the risk for infections, autoimmunity, or cancer [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, whether those effects were solely induced by the exposure to gravitational stress remains open, since other parameter for example increased radiation and stress levels, as well as artificial light sources, could also contribute to impaired immune functions.</p>
              <p>Parabolic flights are in this context an attractive alternative to fundamentally investigate physiological alterations including immunological functions in response to short-term gravitational stress [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. During parabolic flights, the body is alternately exposed to phases of hyper- and microgravity. This makes it possible to evaluate how physiological processes can be influenced by gravitational stress. In fact, it could recently been shown that parabolic maneuvers led to an increase of the microbicidal function of human of polymorphonuclear leukocytes [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Based on the diverse observations regarding gravitational stress induced immunological alterations, we hypothesized that short-term gravitational stress can impact the number of circulating leukocyte subsets in the human blood. Accordingly, blood from 18 volunteers was analyzed immediately prior to the parabolic flight maneuvers and immediately thereafter.</p>
              <p>Multi-parameter flow cytometry allows for in-depth phenotypic <italic>ex vivo</italic> characterization of circulating blood cells. Taking advantage of this technology, we performed immune cells profiling in healthy volunteers before and after parabolic flights.</p>
              <p>Since the number of circulating leukocytes can vary over a 24 hour period [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the circadian rhythm has to be considered when experimental observations follow a defined period [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, changes occurring during the parabolic flight period were compared to circadian-mediated changes occurring during the corresponding period one day before the parabolic flight. This comparison is crucial for a valid interpretation of the data, since immune mechanisms underlie bioperiodicity [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. An aspect that was so far rarely considered in similar studies. The circadian rhythm of circulating leukocyte subsets is thought to be controlled by cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which can also be induced in response to stress events such as parabolic flights. Therefore, cortisol levels were determined and correlated with the observed alterations in circulating leukocyte numbers. The present study demonstrates that parabolic flights can be used to investigate immunological alterations induced by gravitational stress, showing alterations in the innate and adaptive immune system.</p>

                <p>The study protocol received an approval by the ethical committee of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (register-number 5158–14). Intake of any kind of medication on a regular basis and a history of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, as well as immune disorders, including diabetes, asthma, or allergies were defined as exclusion criterion.</p>
                <p>All participants provided written informed consent prior inclusion in the study. Participants of parabolic flights usually receive scopolamine as kinetosis prophylaxis. However, in order to avoid any drug-related immunological effects, we refrained from any medication. Three female volunteers showed signs of motion sickness. Each test subject was equipped with an intravenous cannula, from which the blood samples could be obtained during the flight.</p>

                <p>An Airbus A310 performed a single successful test parabola and 30 regular parabolas in which phases of weightlessness were achieved. This microgravity phase of each parabola was flanked by a pull-up and a pull-out phase at about 1.8 g hypergravity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Each phase lasted about 20 seconds. The parabolas were performed in six sets of five parabolas. Each set was separated by steady flight of 5 to 8 minutes. The steady flight in 1 g between two parabolas lasted for 2 min. The cabin conditions remained stable at all times with a pressure of 830 mbar, cabin luminosity of 800 lux and a temperature of 19–21 °C with a humidity of 15%.</p>

                <p>Blood samples were drawn circa 30 min after takeoff prior to the first parabolic maneuver (P0) and three hours later after the last parabola (P180) before the landing procedure was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As control, blood was taken at corresponding time points on the ground 24 h before the parabolic flight (C0 and C180). Thus, the time span from C0 to C180 is referred to as control period and P0 to P180 as parabolic flight period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

                <p>During the parabolic maneuvers, the body is exposed to gravitational levels that substantially differ from that on the ground. The flight maneuver produces a number of parabolas with a phase of weightlessness at nearly 0g. This μg phase is pre- and succeeded by a hypergravity phase, with a gravitational acceleration of 1.8g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To investigate potential effects of gravitational changes on major immune cells subsets and their subpopulations, blood was taken immediately prior to the parabolic maneuvers and immediately thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To control for possible circadian effects, blood was drawn one day before on a ground at the corresponding time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
                <p>The major leukocyte populations in whole human blood were identified through multiparametric flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). A clear CD45 positive leukocyte population was ensured by doublet exclusion and flow stability verification using the time parameter followed by exclusion of unlysed erythrocytes and debris. At the same time, granulocytes can be discriminated from whole lymphocytes according to the CD45 expression level and sideward scatter (SSC) properties.</p>
                <p>Next, among CD45<sup>+</sup> granulocytes, CD16 expression was used to separate neutrophils from all other leukocytes and eosinophils, which were defined as CD16<sup>−</sup> with high SSC properties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The whole T cell population was identified by CD3 expression and further separated into CD4 and CD8 T cells, respectively. Natural killer (NK) cells are defined as CD56<sup>+</sup> and NKT cells as CD3<sup>+</sup>CD56<sup>+</sup> double positive. The NK cells can be further discriminated according to their CD16 expression into mature and immature NK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). B cells were identified as negative for CD3 and CD56, while positive for CD19. Monocytes and their subsets were discriminated according to CD14 and CD16 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The basophils were identified as population with low SSC and low CD45 expression among the CD14/CD16 double negative population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

                <title>Leukocyte numbers were not substantially altered after parabolic stress</title>
                <p>Almost all <italic>in vivo</italic> processes including immunological mechanisms underlie circadian regulations [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, during the three-hour control period, changes in whole leukocyte counts could not be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similarly, the number of leukocytes circulating in the blood remained stable after exposure to gravitational changes during the parabolic flight period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To clearly dissect, whether the leucocyte numbers are affected by the parabolic maneuvers or sources of variation such as the daily circadian rhythm or the difference in environmental factors, the four datasets C0, C180, P0, and P180 were normalized. Therefore, for each individual donor, C180 was subtracted from C0 (C180-C0) and P180 was subtracted from P0 (P180-P0). Subsequently, comparing the resulting difference between the control period (C180-C0) and the parabolic flight period (P180-P0) indicated that at least for a fraction of volunteers, the number of circulating leukocytes increased during the parabolic flight period. This observation could not be attributed to motion sickness observed in three volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

                <title>Granulocyte numbers increased upon parabolic flight</title>
                <p>Granulocytes compose about 60% of all leukocytes and represent the biggest white blood cells population in the human blood [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, it was reasonable to ask, whether also granulocytes numbers remain stable or were altered by gravitational stress, which could explain the leukocyte increase observed in a fraction of analyzed individuals. Indeed, granulocyte numbers remained stable during the control period, but showed, although not significant, a substantial increase during the parabolic flight period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The comparison of the granulocyte kinetics at the control day (C180-C0 difference) with the kinetics of parabolic flights (P180-P0 difference) confirmed that the granulocyte number increased for most volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
                <p>Granulocytes is a collective term for the granular basophil, eosinophil, and neutrophil cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These cells respond rapidly to pathogen associated molecular pattern, allergens, and cellular debris in a non-specific fashion. Activated granulocytes can recruit other immune cells to the site of infection, induce the complement system, or release soluble inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We therefore evaluated the influence of gravitational stress on the cell count within each particular granulocyte population. Neutrophils are largest cell subset within the granulocytes and showed a similar kinetic pattern as was observed for the entire granulocyte population; the number of neutrophils only slightly increased due to gravitational stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Comparing cell kinetics upon parabolic flights (P180-P0) with their circadian controls (C180-C0) showed indeed a significant increase in neutrophil numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

                <p>In contrast to neutrophils, we observed a significant decrease in the number of basophils and eosinophils during parabolic flight as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g003">Fig 3C and 3E</xref>). This trend could be confirmed by comparing the difference between C180-C0 and P180-P0 for basophils and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g003">Fig 3D and 3F</xref>).</p>
                <p>Dendritic cells (DC) bridge the innate and adaptive immune system and can initiate and modulate T cell responses by antigen presentation and cytokine secretion [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. DCs are predominantly resident in lymphoid tissues and organs and only low numbers can be found in the circulation. Nevertheless, circulating DCs can be quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The number of DCs significantly increased during the control period, whereas their numbers remained stable when the volunteers were exposed to gravitational stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Accordingly, we observed a significant difference in the change of DC numbers parabolic flight period in comparison to the control period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g003">Fig 3H</xref>).</p>
                <p>Monocytes, NKT cells, as wells as mature and immature NK cells showed no alteration, which can be attributed to gravitational stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Conclusively, our data demonstrate that numbers of granulocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and DCs change as an effect of gravitational stress.</p>

                <title>Gravitational stress induced a decrease in T and B cell numbers</title>
                <p>Formation of immunological memory and the generation of specific protective antibodies is the hallmark of the adaptive immune system. The major cell populations of the adaptive immune system consist of T cells, which can be identified by CD3 expression, and of B cells identifiable by CD19 expression [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell population can be classified as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To analyze whether the whole T cell pool or specific T cell subpopulations, including memory subsets, are more susceptible to gravitational stress, the T cell populations were quantified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the number of T cells increased during the control period, but decreased significantly after the parabolic maneuvers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This decline became even more evident, when the changes in T cell numbers between the control period and the parabolic flight period (P180-P0 vs. C180-C0) were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). A similar effect could be observed for the CD4 and CD8 positive T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g004">Fig 4C and 4E</xref>). However, comparison of C180-C0 and P180-P0 did not show significant differences, but highlights that at least for a fraction of volunteers, the T cell numbers including CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> dropped substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g004">Fig 4B, 4D and 4F</xref>).</p>

                <p>Next, we asked whether the differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells numbers induced by gravitational changes could be explained by changes in distinct memory cell populations or if all populations were equally affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). While the number of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was influenced by gravitational stress, significant alterations could not be observed for distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets such as naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells (TEM), CD4<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells (TCM), and the subset of T effector memory, re‐expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206272.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>In contrast, the number of CD8<sup>+</sup> populations including naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> TCM, and CD8<sup>+</sup> TEM increased during the control period; whereas this circadian rhythm mediated increase was abolished by gravitational stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g005">Fig 5A, 5C and 5E</xref>).

                <p>B cells play a major role in establishing protective long-term immunity by secretion of antibodies and initiation of T cell responses by presentation of antigens. Additionally, B cells can regulate immune reactions by the secretion of cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar to the whole T cell population the total number of B cells significantly increased during the three hours control period, while this increase was abolished after exposure to gravitational stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

                <title>Cortisol did not explain the observed alterations in circulating leukocyte populations</title>
                <p>Cortisol has been described as co-regulator molecule controlling the circadian rhythm of circulating leukocytes [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It exhibits a robust time-of-day-dependent rhythm in humans and is assumed to usually peak in the morning. However, cortisol levels can change in stress situations [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that parabolic flight is a highly unusual situation, we hypothesized that the observed alterations of leukocyte populations is ascribed to stress induced changes in blood cortisol levels.</p>
                <p>The parabolic flight took place at 8 am, accordingly cortisol levels were determined at 8 am and 11 am for both the control period and the parabolic flight period. Interestingly, no significant circadian increase was observed for the control period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). At the flight day, the initial cortisol levels (P0) were slightly, albeit insignificantly, increased compared to the control time point (C0). However, comparison of the post flight value with the corresponding control value showed a normalization of the cortisol values after the flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Furthermore, comparison of the cortisol changes during the control period with the parabolic flight period revealed no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206272.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Collectively, we conclude that changes in cortisol levels are not explanatory for the observed gravitational stress induced alterations of leukocyte populations.</p>

              <p>Gravitational stress can be experienced not only during space flights, but also through several earthbound activities such as certain amusement activities or extreme sports. As with stress in general, gravitational stress can potentially influence immunological mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Long-term exposure of astronauts to microgravity, cell culture experiments, as well as altered gravity models for humans and mice could indeed confirm impaired immune responses after exposure to gravitational stress [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the exact mechanism of how gravitational stress influences the immune system are completely unclear. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that space flight data were obtained from a very limited number of individuals, all of which were pre-selected according to high psychological and physiological fitness [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although, participation in parabolic flights also requires a certain physiological fitness, the requirements for participation are less restricted compared to space flights, SAHC, and long-term bed rest studies. Thus, parabolic flights are qualified as suitable short-term model to investigate gravity induced physiological changes in diverse pools of individuals. In this initial study only apparently healthy individuals participate in the parabolic flight, in order to proof whether parabolic flights are feasible for investigating gravitational effects on the immune system. Blood from 18 volunteers was analyzed for alterations in circulating leukocyte subsets after gravitational stress. Granulocytes and neutrophils showed increasing cell numbers upon parabolic maneuvers. In contrast, basophils and eosinophils, as well as T cells and B cells including their respective subpopulations showed decreased cell numbers. Thus, our results show that gravitational stress has differential effects on leukocyte populations.</p>
              <p>The observed drop of T cell numbers in peripheral circulation is in agreement with the data obtained from space flights, bungee jumping studies, and hindlimb unloading of mice [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The decrease of circulating T and B cells might be explained by an increased apoptosis rate, which has been demonstrated for Jurkat cells, a human T cell line, exposed to microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another reason for the declining lymphocyte numbers could be their migration into lymphoid organs, as suggested by studies performed in rats, showing that CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells numbers increased in the spleen during space flight [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While a 45 days head-down bed rest study showed a decrease in activated and memory-like tissue B cells [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], a space flight-induced increase in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells could be attributed to increases in resting memory B cells [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our data show a decrease of B cells and B cell subpopulations after parabolic maneuvers, which indicates that parabolic as well as space flights induce different effects in B cells.</p>
              <p>In fact, when comparing space flight data with data obtained from parabolic flights, it needs to be considered that microgravity remains constant over a distinctly longer period during space flights, while hyper- and microgravity alternate during parabolic flights. There is currently only a very limited number of ground based studies available aiming to confirm the immunological data obtained during space flight. Moreover, data obtained from bed rest studies are rather conflicting. For example, one study showed no substantial adverse effect on human immune function after 21 days of head-down tilt bed rest, while others observed an impaired reactivity of certain leukocytes in at least a fraction of individuals [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>Whether the altered leukocyte numbers induced by parabolic maneuvers is associated with functional consequences such as impaired immunity, which was suggested by space- and parabolic flight data [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], remains to be confirmed. Moreover, systematic studies including <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in humans and animals are needed to facilitate gravitational stress induced immune alterations. Our data indicate that the parabolic flights is a suitable model to be included in such comprehensive studies, since specific aspects of space flights and other gravitational stress inducing activities can be mimicked. Studies with bigger cohorts could also consider other demographic parameters such as age and gender, evaluating whether gravitational changes can affect men and women differentially.</p>
              <p>Previously, it was shown that, the number of circulating naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells declined with daytime progression, while effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts peak during daytime [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0206272.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This circadian rhythm dependent variation was considered in our experimental setup, since the control period was established, by drawing blood one day prior to the parabolic flight at the corresponding time points. Circadian changes in cortisol levels are associated with the circadian rhythm of circulating leukocyte numbers [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For example, T cell counts in the blood are controlled by circadian variation in cortisol production, which regulates the expression of CXCR4 on T cells, leading to their re-migration into the bone marrow, following the gradient of CXCL12, the ligand of CXCR4 [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, stress hormone induction mediated by bungee jumping led to a suppression of innate immune mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These data led us assume that gravitational stress induced changes in cortisol levels can mediate the alterations in leukocyte numbers. However, significant increases of cortisol levels mediated by parabolic maneuvers could not be detected, indicating that cortisol was not responsible for the observed changes in leukocytes numbers. We did observe higher cortisol levels immediately prior to the parabolic maneuvers as compared to the corresponding control time point. An observation we attribute to an increased stress like excitement of the volunteers in anticipation of the flight.</p>
              <p>In addition to the gravitational stress during parabolic flights, there are other environmental parameters potentially affecting the whole organism and subsequently the leukocyte number. This includes intensified radiation, increased light intensities, and sterility of the environment, which can be insufficiently simulated on earth, but have to be considered and controlled in future studies. In fact, data from a simulated long-haul flight also suggests an impairment of certain immune mechanism indicating that besides gravitational stress other environmental parameters such as hypobaric hypoxic conditions could mediate immune dysfunctions [<xref rid="pone.0206272.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>Whether the immunological alterations mediated by gravitational stress could affect the susceptibility for infections, auto-immunity, or tumors should also be analyzed in the future for example <italic>in vitro</italic> by stimulation of certain leukocyte subsets isolated after exposure to gravitational stress.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that even short-term exposure to gravitational stress affects the composition of the innate and of the adaptive immune system. Repeated subjection to gravitational stress can therefore have adverse consequences for the efficacy of the immune response.</p>
