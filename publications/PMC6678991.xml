                <p>Background: Lung cancer cells are known to change proliferation and migration under simulated microgravity. In this study, we sought to evaluate cell adherence, apoptosis, cytoskeleton arrangement, and gene expression under simulated microgravity. Methods: Human lung cancer cells were exposed to simulated microgravity in a random-positioning machine (RPM). Cell morphology and adherence were observed under phase-contrast microscopy, cytoskeleton staining was performed, apoptosis rate was determined, and changes in gene and protein expression were detected by real-time PCR with western blot confirmation. Results: Three-dimensional (3D)-spheroid formation was observed under simulated microgravity. Cell viability was not impaired. Actin filaments showed a shift in alignment from longitudinal to spherical. Apoptosis rate was significantly increased in the spheroids compared to the control. <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>PTEN,</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> gene expression was significantly upregulated in the adherent cells under simulated microgravity with an increase in corresponding protein production for p14 and RB1. <italic>SOX2</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in the adherent cells, but protein was not. Gene expressions of <italic>AKT3</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA,</italic> and <italic>NFE2L2</italic> remained unaltered. Conclusion: Simulated microgravity induces alteration in cell adherence, increases apoptosis rate, and leads to upregulation of tumor suppressor genes in human lung cancer cells.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the western world. The age-standardized incidence of lung cancer ranges from 33.3 to 66.8 per 100,000 among males and 10.5 to 37.5 per 100,000 among females [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease carries a poor prognosis with a mortality rate of 46.0 per 100,000 individuals per year in the United States [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The advent of molecular targeted therapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of lung cancer [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In order to develop advanced therapeutic strategies, a more detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms at play is necessary. In vitro studies may hold the key to understanding these mechanisms. </p>
              <p>Conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures suffer from several limitations, including accelerated cell senescence [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], cytoskeletal stretching [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and altered apoptosis rates [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D)-cultured cells have shown phenotype expression that is closer to the original tissue than those grown in 2D. Compared with 2D-cultured cells, 3D-cultured hepatocytes have demonstrated enzyme expression closer to mature hepatocytes [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while 3D-cultured mesothelioma spheroids have shown upregulation in argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) expression [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, drug testing of 3D-cultured cells may also prove both more clinically relevant and more accurate than drug testing of 2D-cultures. Both ovarian and colorectal cancer cell spheroids have shown a higher resistance to cytostatic agents than 2D cultures [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while lung adenocarcinoma spheroids have shown decreased radiation sensitivity [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These studies suggest that spheroids may prove to be a convenient and clinically relevant model for cancer drug testing. </p>
              <p>Simulated microgravity created by a random positioning machine (RPM) places cells in a novel state of equilibrium that allows their observation in a scaffold-free environment that is influenced by very low external forces. </p>
              <p>We previously demonstrated that breast and thyroid cancer cells [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], chondrocytes [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and tenocytes [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] form 3D cell compounds or spheroids that are characterized by significant cytoskeletal rearrangement and changes in gene expression compared to cells grown under 1-g conditions. In certain tumors, including colorectal cancer and melanoma [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], simulated microgravity has been shown to increase the rate of apoptosis. Conversely, simulated microgravity decreases apoptosis in human fetal fibroblasts [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p>
              <p>We previously showed that lung cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity on a rotating clinostat demonstrate spheroid formation with altered cell proliferation and migration [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These lung cancer spheroids have the potential to serve as a valuable model to further understand cancer pathophysiology and sensitivity to various therapies. </p>
              <p>It is currently not known if lung cancer spheroids also exhibit cytoskeletal rearrangement, altered adherence and tumor-related gene expression, and apoptosis. In this study, we exposed human squamous lung cancer cells to simulated microgravity in a random positioning machine to investigate changes in cell adherence, cytoskeleton alteration, gene/protein expression, and apoptosis in a spheroid model. </p>

                <p>During the observation period, cells under simulated microgravity showed detachment from the culture surface and formation of spheroids. Cells under simulated microgravity had round to cylindrical shapes, and spheroids increased in size during ongoing exposure. In the 1-g control group, cells showed typical flat polygonal morphology and remained attached to the culture surface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03601-f001">Figure 1</xref> depicts the course of spheroid formation at the beginning of the experiment (A) and after 24 h (B), 48 h (C), 72 h (D), and 96 h (E).

              <p>Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality, and there is a pressing need to improve our therapeutic armamentarium. Many believe that, unlike 3D cultures, 2D cultures cannot sufficiently simulate in vivo conditions [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By applying simulated microgravity to human lung cancer cells in a random positioning machine, we subjected human squamous lung cancer cells to a new 3D equilibrium state. This approach is not novel, with other authors demonstrating successful exposure of human lung cancer cells to simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. What is unique, however, is the investigation of cell adherence, cytoskeletal arrangement, and apoptosis in these squamous lung cancer spheroids. To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring these parameters. As described further below, cell adherence and apoptosis are two particular features that may have a significant relevance with regards to designing new targeted therapies. </p>
              <p>From our study, we observed changes in cell morphology, adherence, cytoskeletal arrangement, gene expression, protein production, and apoptosis. Together, these findings suggest that squamous lung cancer cells, not unlike connective tissue cells, may be exquisitely sensitive to external forces. </p>
              <p>Connective tissue cells such as tenocytes demonstrate alterations in proliferation, collagen production, and gene expression after exposure to shear [<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and a reduction in in vitro senescence and phenotype loss following the application of simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Osteocytes have been found to possess cellular processes that are sensitive to pico Newton magnitude forces and respond with changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Airway smooth muscle cells have also been found to express a contractile phenotype in the presence of mechanical load [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. </p>
              <p>We observed changes in the visual morphology of lung cancer cells in the form of detachment from the culture surface and the formation of round to elliptically shaped spheroids. Spheroid size increased with extended exposure to simulated microgravity. Shear forces have been found to induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells via the Smad 1/5 pathway, inducing caspase 9 [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the other hand, we observed an increase in apoptosis in lung cancer cells under reduced external forces together with an upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, such as <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, and RB1. We postulate that a cellular “gravity sensor” may exist, transforming a reduction in external force into apoptosis signals. Future identification of this “sensor” may provide options to selectively trigger tumor apoptosis in a therapeutic manner. Several pathways may be involved in this gravity sensing, but it is presumed that the cytoskeleton plays a crucial role, wherein the PTEN- PI-3-kinase pathway could be a key effector [<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. With its role in cytoskeleton formation and arrangement, the CDKN2A-p14 pathway is another possible candidate to mediate the effects of microgravity [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further experiments that may include methods such as gene silencing are required to further elucidate this question. </p>
              <p>The terminal uracil-nicked end labeling (TUNEL) assay revealed a significantly higher proportion of apoptotic cells than non-viable cells on Trypan blue staining. Other authors have made similar discoveries. Gain et al. attributed this phenomenon to the higher sensitivity of the TUNEL assay, with cells taking up stain before changes could be detected by Trypan blue. [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As a result of the measurement time points chosen, it is conceivable that several cells entered apoptosis without compromising viability. Future viability experiments including later time points are required to answer this question. Pisanu et al. found an increased apoptosis rate under simulated microgravity in a non-small cell lung cancer cell line known to be rich in stem cells [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Exact mechanisms and underlying pathways have to be investigated in future studies. We noted a few significant visible cytoskeletal changes. First, actin filaments demonstrated rearrangement from a longitudinal pattern under 1-g-conditions in control cells to a spherical pattern in simulated microgravity. This is a documented phenomenon seen in other cell types [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Second, actin orientation in adherent cells under simulated microgravity was halfway between longitudinal and spherical, suggesting a transitional state. It is feasible that simulated microgravity first disrupts cell adherence, and continued exposure then induces a new 3D cell rearrangement into spheroids. Taken together, these findings lend credence to the postulated “gravity-sensing” function of the cytoskeleton [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is known that filaments of polymerized actin are enhanced at focal adhesion sites, mediating intercellular contact [<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and may not only mediate the response of an individual cell to gravity but also facilitate the propagation of signals between cells at cell contact sites and may thus play a coordinating role in this process. The exact mechanisms behind this remain to be discovered. Further, actin filaments partake in the process of cell division, and disruption interferes with the correct orientation of the mitosis spindle [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This may explain a reduction in cell proliferation under simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B33-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>Selective modification of actin alignment in malignant cells by other molecular methods, such as RNA-interference or epigenetic modification, may pave the way towards new options in cancer therapy. This study has some limitations. Spheroids were collected by sedimentation, and efforts were taken to minimize the duration of the sedimentation period to minimize the effect of gravity. This reduced the number of sedimented spheroids and allowed determination of their actin structure qualitatively but was insufficient to quantify the ratio of longitudinally- to spherically-aligned cytoskeletons. This will be the subject of future investigative efforts. </p>
              <p>Some of the alterations in gene expression that were detected are indicative of an alteration in cell adherence mechanisms. PTEN upregulation has been shown to attenuate cell adhesion in osteosarcoma cells [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the other hand, SOX2 overexpression suggests enhanced cell adhesion in human dental pulp stem cells [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The question of whether microgravity induces a more malignant or a more benign phenotype in tumor cells is still a subject of debate. </p>
              <p>Some investigators found a shift towards a more benign phenotype. Chang et al. reported decreased proliferation and decreased expression of MMP2 in lung cancer cells under simulated microgravity, suggesting a reduction in metastatic potential [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. </p>
              <p>We found an upregulation of tumor suppressor genes in our experiments. <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic>, and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> have been identified as tumor suppressor genes in lung cancer [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The TP53 gene product is known to act as a tumor suppressor by binding to damaged DNA, arresting cell cycle to allow time for repair and to induce apoptosis in case of failed repair [<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. </p>
              <p>PTEN plays a role in cell adherence and is an important negative regulator of the cell-survival signaling pathway initiated by phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell survival, particularly in cells responsive to growth factors. [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. <italic>PTEN</italic> upregulation under simulated microgravity, especially in the adherent cells, may indicate reduced tumor proliferation and survival. Several interactions exist between the PI3K-PTEN and the TP53 pathway. We observed an upregulation of <italic>TP53</italic> gene expression in the adherent cells and TP53 protein production in the spheroids, suggesting synergism between the two pathways. Additionally, TP53 increases the recycling of the adhesion molecule integrin α5β1 and therefore plays a role in adherence/invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Cyclin-dependent kinase CDKN2A inactivates cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6), which in turn decrease phosphorylation of the pRb [<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Unphosphorylated pRb blocks transcriptional activation of E2F and thereby attenuates cell proliferation [<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We observed upregulation of both <italic>CDKN2A</italic> /P14 and <italic>RB1</italic>/RB1 tumor suppressors both at the gene and at the protein level under simulated microgravity. These changes may suggest transformation towards a less malignant phenotype under simulated microgravity. </p>
              <p>PI3K/AKT/mTOR is a pivotal signal transduction pathway involved in regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, differentiation, and motility [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B43-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We found that the expression of oncogenes <italic>AKT3</italic>, NFE2L2, and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> as a catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) remained unchanged under simulated microgravity. The reasons for this are as yet unclear. It is possible that assessment at earlier or later timepoints might yield different results, as it is known that changes in gene expression under real and simulated microgravity can occur very rapidly, within minutes to hours [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is thus possible that assessment at the 72 h timepoint may have been too late to detect these changes. However, we also observed an upregulation of the oncogene <italic>SOX2. SOX2</italic> and its downstream target <italic>PIK3CA</italic> are both located on the genomic region 3q and are known to play a crucial role in the initiation and the progression of squamous cell lung cancer. Its gene function seems to support squamous identity of the tumor cells and may therefore act as a “lineage survival oncogene” rather than a gene of ongoing dedifferentiation [<xref rid="B46-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We observed increased gene upregulation and protein production of SOX2 under simulated microgravity, particularly in the adherent cells. This finding supports the theory of a more “in vivo-like” phenotype expression under 3D culture conditions. <italic>PIK3CA,</italic> as a downstream target of <italic>SOX2,</italic> was not upregulated in our experiments. As it is known that SOX2 is activated particularly in early stages of non-squamous lung cancer [<xref rid="B47-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], activation of its downstream targets could still be forthcoming at our observation time point of 72 h. For some of our target genes and proteins, we found differences in gene and protein up- or down-regulation, respectively, namely for <italic>TP53</italic>/TP53, <italic>PTEN</italic>/PTEN, and <italic>SOX2</italic>/SOX2. These findings could be explained by the existence of various post-translational modifications, differing half-lives of proteins, rapid degradation of mRNA, or delayed protein synthesis [<xref rid="B48-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Other authors have reported a general decrease in protein synthesis under microgravity for unknown reasons [<xref rid="B49-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is notable that we found changes in gene expression and protein production in the adherent cells under simulated microgravity that differed from those in the spheroids. It is possible that the adherent cell cohort may not just be an intermediate state or precursor of spheroids but may constitute a distinct entity with specific characteristics. Future long-term experiments are necessary to determine if these cells will react to simulated microgravity with delayed detachment (or loss of adherence) or even no detachment. As these long-term adherent cells may represent a less invasive phenotype, identifying the characteristics of this subgroup may provide further understanding into the mechanisms contributing to metastasis and invasion. Cell adherence and apoptosis are two particular features that may have a significant relevance with regards to designing new targeted therapies. Respective information may facilitate the future development of new therapeutic agents. With regards to future space travel, our results do not support that microgravity itself induces lung cancer in astronauts. It is difficult to directly extrapolate in vitro cell culture results to a whole organism, and many additional factors, including space radiation and changes in the immune system in the absence of gravity, neither of which could be explored in our study, may contribute to the risk of carcinogenesis [<xref rid="B50-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijms-20-03601" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Experiments in space involving animal models may bridge the gap between culture dish and whole organism and may further deepen our understanding of the effects of space on lung cancer growth. </p>

              <p>Simulated microgravity induces alteration in cell adherence, increases apoptosis rates, and leads to upregulation of tumor suppressor genes in human lung cancer cells. These findings may be important in the field of medical oncology. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms at play may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in our crusade against cancer. </p>
