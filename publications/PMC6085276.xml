                  <p>SMG-treated HUVECs appeared obvious growth inhibition after return to normal gravity, which might be attributed to a set of responses including alteration of cytoskeleton, decreased cell adhesion capacity and increased apoptosis. Expression levels of mTOR and its downstream Apaf-1 were increased during subsequent culturing after SMG. miR-22 was up-regulated and its target genes SRF and LAMC1 were down-regulated at mRNA levels. LAMC1 siRNAs reduced cell adhesion rate and inhibited stress fiber formation while SRF siRNAs caused apoptosis.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0010">Space environment is characterized by high LET radiation, ultra-high vacuum, weak magnetic field and microgravity. Spaceflight may cause skeletal muscle atrophy, bone loss and dysfunction of cardiovascular systems, which are due to the effects of microgravity.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Ground-based simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions can be achieved through the use of the most advanced rotary cell culture system (RCCS-1). The rotational motion of this system prevents sedimentation by randomization of the gravity vector, creating an optimized suspension culture capable of supporting 3-D cell growth on microcarrier bead scaffolds.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Thus, RCCS-1 can effectively simulate certain aspects of microgravity, which is helpful for better understanding of the effects of microgravity on many cellular activities.</p>
              <p id="p0015">Studies have revealed that microgravity can exert its detrimental effects on astronauts via changes in cellular structure and/or functions. Recently, there has been more research interest in the effect of microgravity on the structure and function of human cells. Cytoskeletal disruption occurs in several cell types including lymphocytes, glial cells, and osteoblasts both during spaceflight and in SMG.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is reported that phenotypic switch was induced by SMG on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, characterized by different morphologies.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> SMG induced partial arrest in G2/M phase in MCF-7 cells<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> and inhibited cell growth in malignant glioma cells due to a slowdown of the processions of all the cell cycle phases.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0020">Endothelium is one of the tissues most sensitive to microgravity conditions. Endothelial cells form the inner lining of blood vessels and provide a semi-permeable barrier between the blood and underlying tissues, thus playing an important role in the maintenance of the vascular homeostasis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Endothelial cells are highly sensitive to mechanical stress, including hypergravity and microgravity. They undergo morphological and functional changes in response to alterations of gravity.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In particular microgravity leads to changes in endothelial cell phenotype and behavior.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Endothelial dysfunction is regarded as an early event in atherosclerosis, possibly associated with vascular alterations of cardiovascular system disorders in spaceflight and post-flight period. At the end of the 12-day outer spaceflight, it is reported that endothelial cells displayed profound changes including cytoskeletal disruption, premature senescence, and increased cell membrane permeability. Readapted cells of subsequent passages exhibited persisting cytoskeletal changes, decreased metabolism and cell growth indicating endothelial dysfunction.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> However, there are very few studies on the mechanisms in the functional alteration of human endothelial cells during subsequent culturing after SMG treatment.</p>
              <p id="p0025">Serum Response Factor (SRF) is a serum response element-binding transcription factor, which encodes a ubiquitous nuclear protein that participates in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is reported that SRF is a key regulator for endothelial cell function and plays important roles in multiple aspects of atherogenesis. Downregulation of SRF inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of endothelial cells, which contributed to endothelial dysfunction.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a highly conserved protein kinase and a central controller of cell growth. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a critical regulator in vascular endothelial cells responding to upstream cellular signals, such as growth factors and stress, participating in controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, protein synthesis and metabolism.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> It is reported that Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) could suppress mTOR expression by acting as an upstream regulator of mTOR, promoting apoptosis.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), one of pro-apoptotic proteins, functions in downstream apoptotic pathway of mTOR signaling.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> mTOR may be involved in the development of atherosclerotic plaque, and dysregulation of mTOR signaling often occurs in human cardiovascular diseases.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Laminin family assemble from α-, β- and γ-chain, which play a role in cell proliferation, adhesion, spreading and migration in both normal and pathologic processes.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> The laminin γ-1 chain is the most ubiquitously expressed γ subunit, encoded by LAMC1 that can influence intracellular pathway to regulate the cytoskeleton changes and interfere endothelial barrier function.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref></p>
              <p id="p0030">The aim of this study was to identify the exact cellular changes and epigenetic mechanism in alterations of human endothelial cells during subsequent culture after SMG treatment. We found that HUVECs exhibited remarkable growth inhibition, which might be attributed to a set of responses including alteration of cytoskeleton, decreased cell adhesion capacity and increased apoptosis. The mechanism of growth inhibition may be explained by the decrease in miR-22 targeting SRF and LAMC1 mRNAs, and the increase in the expression levels of Apaf-1 in mTOR signaling. This study provides a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms in the dysfunction of the cardiovascular systems after microgravity.</p>

                <p id="p0035">HUVECs cells were obtained from Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (KeyGen, Nanjing, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Hillex II microcarrier beads (Solohill Engineering Laboratories, MI) were used as described in previous report.<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded onto 50 mg microcarrier beads in 60 mm petri dishes in normal culture condition for 24 h. This timeline was sufficient to allow HUVECs to attach to the microcarrier surface. Then, they were transferred to either 50-ml high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) in the RCCS-1 (NASA, USA) to model microgravity or to 60 mm petri dishes for gravity controls (G). The culture of cell-beads was performed in this device in a 5% CO2 incubator at 95% humidity. The horizontally rotating culture vessel was filled with the complete medium (without air-liquid interface to reduce the shear stress). After a defined rotational speed was reached, the cells were maintained in a near laminar fluid flow environment (i.e., a free-fall state). To study subsequent effects of SMG, HUVECs in both the G and SMG groups were detached from microcarriers using 0.05% Trypsin and 0.02% EDTA, and then cultured in normal growth condition for the indicated time.</p>

              <p id="p0115">A number of evidence show that microgravity can affect the structure and function in a variety of human and animal cells by the use of clinorotation-based systems.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> RCCS-1 bioreactor represents a reasonable alternative to spaceflight and allows the modelling of microgravity on the ground. In the present study, we utilized RCCS-1 bioreactor to investigate cellular changes during subsequent culturing after SMG treatment. We here reported that when those SMG-treated cells returned to normal gravity, they displayed obvious growth inhibition, a transition from the decrease in cell adhesion ability in earlier time, actin cytoskeleton lesions within 72 h to induction of apoptosis in the later time. The mechanism of growth inhibition might be associated with miR-22 and mTOR/Apaf-1 signaling.</p>
              <p id="p0120">The effects of spaceflight on cardiovascular health after astronauts have returned should not be ignored because it is very important to understand the development of atherosclerosis and potential cardiovascular problems. Spaceflight leads to an internal environment that decreases plasma volume during flight but rebounds after flight, leading to a dilution of circulating soluble adhesion markers sICAM-1 and sE-selection.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Spaceflight-induced IL-6 and ICAM-1 remain to be elevated even after 3 months post spaceflight travel. The downregulation of eNOS expression in revived HUVEC cells suggests a reduced protection of the cells and the surrounding vessels against future insults that may lead to atherosclerosis.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Therefore, microgravity-induced endothelial dysfunction might occur after spaceflight or SMG treatment.</p>
              <p id="p0125">Exposure to microgravity generates alterations that are similar to those involved in age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular deconditioning, bone loss and muscle atrophy. Endothelial dysfunction is the common denominator,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> which has been linked to human cardiovascular system disorders in spaceflight and post-spaceflight period. Revived HUVEC after real spaceflight exhibited persisting cytoskeletal changes and decreased cell growth indicating cellular senescence.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> In the present study, we discovered a set of cellular responses in HUVECs after SMG treatment, including the decrease in cell adhesion ability in the earlier time, actin cytoskeleton lesions within 72 h, and induction of apoptosis in the later time. We found that cell adhesion ability decreased at 2 h and 4 h of subculture in the earlier time after SMG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), implying that initial cells attached to the surface of culture dish in SMG group were less than that in G group. Cell adhesion rate recovered at 6 h of subculture might be attributed to the increasing cell number in the two groups. Cell adhesion can be involved in signal transduction and integrating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular tension.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Endothelial cells have actin stress fibers, and the ends of stress fibers terminate at a structure similar to the adhesion plaque of cultured cells. The decrease in cell adhesion ability was observed in the earlier time after SMG, which might trigger cellular signaling through adhesion plaque to affect endothelial cell structure and growth. Cytoskeletal structure is very critical for control of growth and cell fate switching.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> We found that actin stress fiber formation was remarkably reduced at 24, 48 and 72 h of subculture after SMG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C), which was consistent with persisting cytoskeletal changes observed after real spaceflight.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Above all, we suppose that these alterations might commonly contribute to growth inhibition of human endothelial cells after SMG treatment.</p>
              <p id="p0130">Several studies showed transcription alterations in the endothelial cells exposed to microgravity. For example, PCNA transcript, a marker of cell mitosis, was found to be decreased in the absence of gravity.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Post-flight microarray analysis revealed 1023 significantly modulated genes, the majority of which are involved in cell adhesion, oxidative phosphorylation, stress responses, cell cycle, and apoptosis.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> We suppose that those genes might be involved in growth inhibition of HUVECs after SMG treatment. In our study, we found the alterations of transcription factors SRF and mTOR, which are critical regulators in vascular endothelial cells and associated with endothelial dysfunction. Recent study has demonstrated SRF was a physiological target of miR-320a, implicated in cardiovascular diseases.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> We also identified SRF as a novel target of miR-22 and found that miR-22 caused apoptosis and inflammation in HUVECs via targeting SRF.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Here, we demonstrated that miR-22 was up-regulated but SRF was down-regulated in SMG group compared to G group after SMG, indicating that SRF might be involved in growth inhibition and apoptosis during subsequent culturing after SMG treatment. It is reported that LAMC1 is important for bodies to keep stability and control growth.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> We found that LAMC1 could regulate cell proliferation and cytoskeleton changes through FAK signaling in endosulfan-exposed cells.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Here, we confirmed LAMC1 is a novel target gene of miR-22. LAMC1 siRNAs (si-2, 3) significantly decreased cell adhesion rate and each LAMC1 siRNA disrupted the formation of stress fibers. LAMC1 was down-regulated in SMG group compared to G group after SMG, indicating that LAMC1 might be associated with the alteration of cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton during subsequent culturing after SMG treatment. In addition, a mammalian counterpart of TOR complex 2 (mTORC2) contains mTOR and seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> It is possible that the alteration of actin cytoskeleton was associated with mTORC2, which needs to be further discussed.</p>
              <p id="p0135">It was previously demonstrated that miR-22 reduces the expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of the AKT pathway in cardiomyocytes<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> miR-22 may suppress autophagy through activation of AKT, which may, in turn, activate the kinase mTOR, a negative regulator of the autophagic process.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> In this study, PTEN was not down-regulated by miR-22. In fact, we observed the mild increase in PTEN protein expression levels during subsequent culturing after SMG treatment (data not shown). It is reported that PTEN could inhibit the proliferation and promote apoptosis of K562 cells through regulating mTOR signaling pathway.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Expression of mTOR and its downstream Apaf-1 were remarkably up-regulated in SMG group compared to G group. Therefore, the mechanism of growth inhibition after SMG treatment may be explained by alterations of mTOR signaling and miR-22-mediated mechanism.</p>
              <p id="p0140">In conclusion, the evidence presented the subsequent effects of SMG on HUVECs and mainly involves examination of the underlying mechanisms of growth inhibition during subsequent culturing after SMG treatment. Our data presented here open a wide range of specific investigations in terms of subsequent effects of microgravity, providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms in biological processes of the cardiovascular systems after microgravity.</p>
