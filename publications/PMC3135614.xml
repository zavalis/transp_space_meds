              <abstract>
                <p>In the present study, we discovered that mouse oocyte maturation was inhibited by simulated microgravity via disturbing spindle organization. We cultured mouse oocytes under microgravity condition simulated by NASA's rotary cell culture system, examined the maturation rate and observed the spindle morphology (organization of cytoskeleton) during the mouse oocytes meiotic maturation. While the rate of germinal vesicle breakdown did not differ between 1 g gravity and simulated microgravity, rate of oocyte maturation decreased significantly in simulated microgravity. The rate of maturation was 8.94% in simulated microgravity and was 73.0% in 1 g gravity. The results show that the maturation of mouse oocytes in vitro was inhibited by the simulated microgravity. The spindle morphology observation shows that the microtubules and chromosomes can not form a complete spindle during oocyte meiotic maturation under simulated microgravity. And the disorder of γ-tubulin may partially result in disorganization of microtubules under simulated microgravity. These observations suggest that the meiotic spindle organization is gravity dependent. Although the spindle organization was disrupted by simulated microgravity, the function and organization of microfilaments were not pronouncedly affected by simulated microgravity. And we found that simulated microgravity induced oocytes cytoplasmic blebbing via an unknown mechanism. Transmission electron microscope detection showed that the components of the blebs were identified with the cytoplasm. Collectively, these results indicated that the simulated microgravity inhibits mouse oocyte maturation via disturbing spindle organization and inducing cytoplasmic blebbing.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Microgravity has been reported to induce numerous adverse effects on animals. Studies on astronauts have shown that microgravity is closely associated with bone loss, muscle atrophy, as well as decreased immune <xref rid="pone.0022214-Graebe1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-White1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Zayzafoon1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Ideally, real spaceflights should be used to study the effects of space gravity variations, these opportunities, however, are very limited, in addition to the high costs, short duration, deferred reaction, and interference from other conditions aboarding the spacecraft <xref rid="pone.0022214-PurevdorjGage1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As a result, simulation models have been designed to test the gravitational effect on the biological systems. Ground-based models have generated reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses <xref rid="pone.0022214-Tou1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recently, it has been reported that simulated microgravity disrupted mouse early embryo development <xref rid="pone.0022214-Wakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The effects of decreased gravity on mammalian oocyte maturation, however, have not been investigated.</p>
              <p>Mammalian oocyte maturation entails an ordered series of cellular events, including germinal vesicle breakdown, chromosome condensation, spindle formation and migration. The asymmetrical cellular division produces polar bodies and a big, competent, fertilizable oocyte. These events are dependent upon the dynamic changes of oocyte cytoskeleton (microtubules and microfilaments). The cytoskeleton has been described as the structure through which cells sense gravity <xref rid="pone.0022214-Ingber1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Microtubules, which play essential roles during mitosis, including chromosome capture, congregation, and segregation, and cytokinesis <xref rid="pone.0022214-Maiato1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-KlineSmith1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, were altered and mitosis was prolonged in human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 when cultured under weightless conditions <xref rid="pone.0022214-Vassy1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Microfilaments are disorganized in simulated microgravity through activation of Rho, a serine and threonine kinase <xref rid="pone.0022214-Higashibata1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In view of the effects of microgravity on cytoskeleton and the importance of cytoskeleton during oocyte maturation, we hypothesize that the decrease of gravity influences the process of oocyte maturation. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effect of simulated microgravity on the mouse oocytes maturation <italic>in vitro</italic> and to determine whether the effect is on the microtubules or microfilaments. We used the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) made by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to simulate microgravity and studied its effects on mammalian oocyte maturation using the mouse as a model.</p>

                <p>Animal care and handling were conducted in accordance with policies on the care and use of animals promulgated by the ethical committee of the Guangdong Medical and Laboratorial Animal Center.</p>
                <p>Female Kunming White mice at 6–8 weeks of age were injected intraperitoneally with 7.5 IU of PMSG. The females were euthanized 45–48 h post-PMSG administration, and fully grown, germinal vesicle (GV)-intact oocytes were retrieved from each ovary by puncturing the follicles with a 26 gauge sterile needle. The collection medium was M199 with 25 mM HEPES buffer (GIBCO, Cat. No.12350039). The GV oocytes were then transferred into M199 (GIBCO, Cat. No.11150059) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone), 1 IU/ml FSH, 1 IU/ml hCG, 1 µg/ml estradiol, and 0.036 g/l sodium pyruvate, and were cultured in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air at 37°C.</p>
                <p>Oocytes were cultured in 50 µl droplets under mineral oil in Falcon petri dishes (Item No.351008) under 1 g gravity. We used the RCCS (Sythecon, USA) developed by NASA to simulate microgravity. The 2-ml high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) used in the RCCS provide a low-turbulence, low-shear cell culture environment with abundant oxygenation. The rotation randomizes the gravitational vector and leaves cells in a state of constant free-fall, mimicking some aspects of microgravity <xref rid="pone.0022214-Schwarz1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Nickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. After 16 hours culture, the oocytes were collected to examine the maturation rate. The culture experiments were repeated more than 3 times. The total number of oocytes was 1012 in 1 g gravity group, and the total number was 1726 in simulated microgravity group. To detect γ-tubulin, oocytes were collected at 6-hour, 9-hour and 16 hour, respectively. And this experiment was repeated three times.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity compromises mouse oocyte maturation</title>
                <p>To investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on mouse oocyte maturation, immature (GV stage) oocytes were cultured for spontaneously maturation under conditions of 1 g gravity and simulated microgravity. 16 hours later, the proportions of GV, GVBD and MII oocytes in the two groups were recorded after the onset of maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). At 1 g and simulated microgravity, 1.94%±0.43% (n = 1,012) and 1.52%±0.38% (n = 1,726) oocytes did not undergo GVBD (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), respectively, indicating that the resumption of meiosis was not affected by gravity. On the contrary, extrusion of the first polar body and progression to the MII stage was significantly affected by gravity. While 73.0%±2.6% (n = 1,012) of oocytes extruded the first polar body under 1 g condition, only 8.94%±2.35% oocytes (n = 1,726) did so under simulated microgravity (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). Although oocytes underwent GVBD under simulated microgravity, the oocytes showed different phenotypes observed with light microscope. Most of oocytes still sustained the ball-shape, 12.96% of oocytes underwent cytoplasmic blebbing, and 13.03% of oocytes formed a cytoplasmic protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Our results indicated that the mouse oocyte maturation was remarkable compromised when cultured under microgravity condition.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity disrupts meiotic spindle organization</title>
                <p>As mentioned above, 80% oocytes that underwent GVBD could not progress to MII stage. Because the meiotic spindle is the main cellular apparatus responsible for cell division (polar body extrusion), we examined the meiotic spindle under different gravity conditions.</p>
                <p>At 1 g gravity, meiotic I spindle was well organized several hours after GVBD, exhibiting a typical barrel shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g002">Fig. 2A, a</xref>). The meiotic II spindle, which is also barrel-shaped, quickly formed after the first polar body extruded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g002">Fig. 2A, c</xref>). However, under simulated microgravity condition, typical MI spindle could not form. Chromosomes were able to congregate, but microtubules failed to arrange chromosomes correctly. In some oocytes, condensed chromosomes were surrounded by little unordered microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g002">Fig. 2A,d</xref>). And in other oocytes, chromosomes-attached microtubules were not obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g002">Fig. 2A, e</xref>). In the oocytes which extruded the first polar body under microgravity condition, the meiotic II spindle was also deformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g002">Fig. 2A, f</xref>). As the normal spindle configuration in simulated microgravity was the same with that in 1 g gravity, we did not show the normal spindle picture in simulated microgravity. The percentage of different microtubule subtypes was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0022214-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). There were only 4.83%+1.54% oocytes formed normal spindle which were cultured under simulated microgravity. Our results indicated that simulated microgravity disrupted meiotic spindle organization, probably by interrupting microtubules organization, which might be one reason that most oocytes could not extrude the first polar body in microgravity condition.</p>

In ground-based studies, the random positioning machine (PRM, a 3D clinostat system), and RCCS are commonly used to simulated microgravity condition. In addition to simulate microgravity, RCCS can be used to generate shear stress to cultured cells <xref rid="pone.0022214-Xie1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Microgravity condition simulated by RCCS promotes spermatocytes entry into the first meiotic division <xref rid="pone.0022214-Pellegrini1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In this study, we used the RCCS to simulated microgravity and examined the effects of simulated microgravity on mouse oocytes maturation. Even though microgravity has no effect on the resumption of meiosis or microfilament organization and functions, microgravity profoundly inhibited the polar body extrusion by disrupting the organization of microtubules. As the γ-tubulin is essential for regulating microtubule dynamics and the abnormal distribution of γ-tubulin in simulated microgravity, we speculated that the disorganization of microtubules in simulated microgravity even not all but partially was the results of the disorder of γ-tubulin.</p>
              <p>Microtubules are essential component of meiotic spindle, which manages polar body extrusion and distributes genetic materials equally into the polar body and the remaining oocyte. Microtubule nucleation is initiated from γ-tubulin and disrupted γ-tubulin promotes spindle microtubule disorganization <xref rid="pone.0022214-RaynaudMessina1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Zimmerman1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As the oocytes begin to mature, microtubules polymerize around the chromosomes and eventually assemble into the meiotic spindle. Previous studies have showed that microtubule self-organization is gravity-dependent. For human lymphocytes (Jurkat), human epithelial cells (MCF-7), human thyroid carcinoma cells, and swine testicular cells <xref rid="pone.0022214-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Vassy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Infanger1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Strollo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, microtubule organizations under simulated microgravity conditions were substantially reduced compared with those under 1 g conditions. In our study, normal meiotic spindles were formed in mouse oocytes under 1 g gravity. But most oocytes cultured in simulated microgravity formed abnormal spindles with few microtubules. Knockdown of γ-tubulin by siRNA in mouse oocytes resulted in smaller spindles with misaligned chromosomes <xref rid="pone.0022214-Barrett1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study, the organization of γ-tubulin was disordered in simulated microgravity, which induced the failure of aggregation of microtubules and resulted in abnormal spindle. The results indicate that the microtubule polymerization and organization of mouse oocytes was disrupted by simulated microgravity and resulted in the malformation of intact meiotic spindles. Although the chromosomes migration was not inhibited by simulated microgravity most likely through the actions of microfilaments, the homologous chromosomes can not separate without the function of spindle microtubules. So the oocyte maturation was inhibited by the simulated microgravity through disordered γ-tubulin microtubules organization and disrupting meiotic spindle assembly.</p>
              <p>During maturation the oocytes develop cell polarity, which is required for asymmetric cell divisions to extrude polar bodies. Microfilaments are required for chromosomes or spindle migration to the cortex of oocytes and are essential for oocyte polarization. A gravity sensitivity of the actin cytoskeleton has been reported on mouse MC 3T3-E1 osteoblasts <xref rid="pone.0022214-Vassy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells <xref rid="pone.0022214-HughesFulford2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Therefore, we supposed that the oocytes might not polarize themselves under microgravity condition. However, our results showed that the function and organization of microfilaments had not been disrupted by simulated microgravity. Chromosomes could still migrate to oocyte periphery and could induce cortical reorganization of microfilaments to form actin caps as normal gravity. Our results were in accord with the researches on J-111 cells and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, in which cells microfilaments are not affected by microgravity <xref rid="pone.0022214-Meloni1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Rosner1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. We reasoned that in different cells types there might be different sensitivities of microfilaments in response to microgravity, or that different cells switch on and off different pathways to react microgravity.</p>
              <p>One important finding in our study is that simulated microgravity induces cytoplasmic micro-protrusions of maturing oocytes. 12.96%±3.2% (n = 1,726) oocytes cultured under simulated microgravity were induced cytoplasmic blebbing. This phenotype was rarely observed in 1 g gravity. Until now, available data concerning structural changes during mouse oocyte maturation in simulated microgravity were relatively scarce. Choroidal epithelial cells appear cytoplasmic extensions on apical surface, partial loss of cell polarization in weightlessness and induced alteration in the fine structure of choroids plexus <xref rid="pone.0022214-Gabrion1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. This was the only one study with cytoplasmic extension in weightlessness we can search. The actin cap was not remarkably in these blebbing oocytes should be because at around anaphase I, oocytes without normal spindle structure can not released from SAC, and microfilaments of actin cap spreaded to the whole oocytes membrane, then induced the cytoplasmic blebbing.</p>
              <p>Some animals studies had been conducted on the effect of microgravity on female reproduction, most of these studies focused on the fertilization, embryo development and pregnancy. Fertilization can occur normally under microgravity and preimplantation embryo development might require 1 g environment <xref rid="pone.0022214-Wakayama1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Rats kept in space during the latter half of their pregnancies are able to support the growth and development of their gestating offspring <xref rid="pone.0022214-Burden1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0022214-Ronca2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. As female astronauts suppress their menstrual cycles during spaceflight <xref rid="pone.0022214-Jennings1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, relatively little is known about the effect of spaceflight on female reproduction. Whether the oocyte maturation and ovulation are normal during female astronauts in weightlessness is still unclear. Here, our observations suggest that oocytes maturation were compromised under simulated microgravity environment.</p>
