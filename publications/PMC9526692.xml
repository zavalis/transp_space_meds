                <p id="Par1">Microgravity-induced bone loss is a major concern for space travelers. Ground-based microgravity simulators are crucial to study the effect of microgravity exposure on biological systems and to address the limitations posed by restricted access to real space. In this work, for the first time, we adopt a multidisciplinary approach to characterize the morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes underlying the response of human bone marrow stromal cells to long-term simulated microgravity exposure during osteogenic differentiation. Our results show that osteogenic differentiation is reduced while energy metabolism is promoted. We found novel proteins were dysregulated under simulated microgravity, including CSC1-like protein, involved in the mechanotransduction of pressure signals, and PTPN11, SLC44A1 and MME which are involved in osteoblast differentiation pathways and which may become the focus of future translational projects. The investigation of cell proteome highlighted how simulated microgravity affects a relatively low number of proteins compared to time and/or osteogenic factors and has allowed us to reconstruct a hypothetical pipeline for cell response to simulated microgravity. Further investigation focused on the application of nanomaterials may help to increase understanding of how to treat or minimize the effects of microgravity.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Since the 1970s space travelers have been known to experience severe bone loss at a rate of 1–1.5% per month, which is only partially responsive to non-pharmacological countermeasures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pharmacological treatments, such as anti-resorptive bisphosphonates, do reduce bone loss in-flight but may interfere with the slow and often incomplete post-flight recovery process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, the exposure to a reduced gravity vector (or microgravity) during spaceflight is a significant and unresolved health risk for space travelers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par3">The bone is a metabolically active tissue in which the mineralized matrix is constantly deposited and resorbed by specialized cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is constituted by an organic portion, the osteoid, and an inorganic portion formed by different calcium phosphates, among which hydroxyapatite is the most represented. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into osteoblasts (OBs), which are cells specialized in the synthesis and deposition of the osteoid that is subsequently mineralized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Osteoclasts (OCs) are, instead, devoted to the resorption of the mineralized matrix. The homeostasis between these cell types ensures a proper remodeling and turnover of the bone tissue. This is controlled by endocrine and paracrine factors, such as hormones and cytokines, which in turn are influenced by physiological, mechanical, and behavioral conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Osteocytes (Ocys) residing within the lacunae of the mineralized bone are ultimately differentiated OBs secreting some of these factors, in function of the mechanical solicitation the whole tissue receives. Ocys are often referred to as the mechanosensors of the bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par4">Previous studies showed that exposure to real microgravity can impair OBs differentiation and mitochondrial energy potential, suppressing bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and can abnormally increase the maturation and activity of OCs, prompting bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, bone resorption-formation balance is disrupted during real microgravity exposure. However, molecular background knowledge of these mechanisms has not been completely understood yet.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Despite developments in space technology, the study of biological specimens in real space conditions is still a constraint. In this regard, ground-based platforms for simulating microgravity on Earth are an effective and invaluable asset. Among others, the random positioning machine (RPM) simulates weightlessness randomly, in a three-dimensional pattern, and represents a bench-top method for gravitational biology and space medicine research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Previous reports have shown that ground-based simulated microgravity (SMG) reduces the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs, although it is acknowledged that many of these studies were performed over short time frames, monitoring the effects of SMG for a maximum of 14 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Several studies have reported that SMG could enhance the multi-differentiation potential, namely the potential to differentiate into other cell types, of BMSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that BMSC morphology is affected, changing from spindle to round shaped under SMG conditions, as a result of cytoskeletal rearrangement and which causes motility loss. Interestingly, Xue et al. found that the effect of SMG on the differentiation of BMSCs is dependent on exposure timespan. Short SMG exposure (72 h) enhanced the differentiation of BMSCs toward endothelial, adipogenic and neuronal lineages, while the longer period (10 days) could surprisingly promote the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that BMSCs, grown in vitro, at 72 h show a reduced adhesion capacity that is transduced with an increase in plasticity and multi-differentiation potential. However, at later time points, they acquire a more differentiated phenotype, according to the additional stimuli they receive. This is only partially in line with what is registered in vivo, in space travelers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In their systematic review, Stavnichuk and coworkers highlighted that biochemical markers of bone resorption increased robustly to 113% above pre-flight levels, while bone formation markers increased slowly, at a rate of 6% per month, during spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], suggesting the influence of in vivo factors was modifying the BMSC response to microgravity. The in vivo situation was also different in terms of radiation exposure, as astronauts were sent into real space.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The present work aims to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of the morphological, biochemical and molecular changes underlying the response of human BMSCs to long-term microgravity exposure (28 days) during osteogenic differentiation. In addition to expression profiling, analysis probing biomarker genes, bone matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, a study on bone mineralization was conducted along with a bottom-up, label-free, high coverage proteome investigation. Overall, our data pointed to an initial down-regulation of the osteogenic differentiation processes, highlighting proteins there were not identified before in SMG, and indicates that this down-regulation is partially reverted at later time points. This work provides research-based data for developing possible countermeasures against spaceflight-induced osteoporosis.</p>

The only statistically significant variations were seen in the levels of COL1A1 and SPP1. In detail, COL1A1 was found upregulated at 28 days with respect to 8 days, both in GC and RPM conditions (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, GC—T8 vs T28 and RPM—T8 vs T28), indicating osteogenic differentiation was undergoing in both conditions. Although, at 28 days in RPM, the COL1A1 content was lower than in GC condition (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, T28—GC vs RPM), suggesting a reduced osteogenic differentiation. SPP1 was found upregulated at 8 days in RPM with respect to 8 days in GC condition (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, T8—GC vs RPM). However, the SPP1 content at 28 days in RPM was lower than at 8 days in RPM (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, RPM—T8 vs T28). The immunoenzymatic quantification of COL3A1, DCN, FN, BGLAP and SPARC showed non-significant variations among the classes.

Additionally, the mineralization of the ECM determined by measuring crystal size revealed a significant reduction in the dimension and an altered percentage distribution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B–D), suggesting impaired osteoblasts activity. Indeed, on RPM, it was already possible to observe smaller crystals at T14 compared to GC conditions. Alizarin red positive spots were almost completely absent in RPM at T8 but they were present at T28, again indicating impaired osteoblasts activity. In accordance, alizarin red absorbance showed a significant reduction of calcium deposits at T8 and T28 in RPM samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>E). These results indicated a reduction in the osteogenic phenotype when BMSCs were exposed to SMG.

                <p id="Par12">F-Actin and β-tubulin were investigated on BMSCs during osteogenic differentiation in order to determine the long-term effect of SMG on cytoskeleton proteins by immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Intensity analysis of the cells revealed that during the first 24 h of microgravity, there was a significant decrease in both tubulin and actin mean intensity; actin filaments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B-1) and the tubulin network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B-2) showed a recovery after 4 days. Indeed, after 28 days, the percentage of tubulin area in cells exposed to SMG was not significantly different compared to GC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B-3). Deeper analysis, initially performed with “fire lookup table” (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C-3 and C-4) and later with mean intensity and fraction area measurements per belt, revealed that distribution of β-tubulin within cells was still altered after 28 days. In particular, the mean intensity of samples exposed to SMG was significantly higher in proximity to the centrosome, and the surface occupied by tubulin was lower in the cell periphery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C-5, C-6, D-1 and D-2). This evidence shows that a cytoskeletal adjustment of β-tubulin and F-actin fibers occurred during the first two days of SMG exposure. However, these changes were almost completely reversed at 28 days, leaving the cells with a reduced β-tubulin fluorescent area in their more peripheral cytosolic portion.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Cytoskeletal reorganization investigated by immunostaining and bio-imaging analysis. <bold>A</bold> β-tubulin (green), F-actin (red) and nuclei (blue) were stained and visualized following 1 h, 1, 4, 8, 14, and 28 days of differentiation, both in GC and RPM conditions. <bold>B</bold> Graphs of F-Actin and β-tubulin mean intensity (<italic>T</italic> tests: * = <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05)<bold>.

                <title>Proteomics investigation of the protein groups affected by SMG</title>
                <p id="Par13">To understand proteome variations caused by SMG during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, we applied a proteomics approach based on mass spectrometry label-free quantification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The proteomics investigation allowed the identification of 4312 protein groups (PGs) in total (Table S1). Following data preprocessing (ratio on time zero, T0, filtering for valid values, log2 transformation, and missing data imputation), the number of PGs was reduced to 4114. To narrow down the number of PGs relevant for this study, multiple sample tests were used to statistically infer the differentially abundant PGs (DAPGs). To simplify the statistical model, and following data interpretation, the two independent variables present in the experiment (time and SMG exposure) were fused into one unique independent variable. The classes of the unique independent variable were therefore four: T8_GC (BMSCs in osteogenic differentiation for 8 days under gravity control), T8_RPM (BMSCs in osteogenic differentiation for 8 days under SMG), T28_GC (BMSCs in osteogenic differentiation for 28 days under gravity control), and T28_RPM (BMSCs in osteogenic differentiation for 28 days under SMG). 486 PGs, reduced to 481 following isoforms check, were differentially abundant among the four classes, and post hoc THSD was applied to annotate class-specific variation for each DAPG (Table S2).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Proteomics investigation. <bold>A</bold> Schematic representation of the experimental proteomics workflow, with indications of the software utilized in the different steps. <bold>B</bold> PCA of the sample replicates based on the protein groups intensities characterizing each sample.

                <p id="Par14">Principal component analysis (PCA) of the sample replicates showed that 59% of variance was due to the first two components (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). The replicates were clustered by the PCA into five groups, based on the two independent variables (time and SMG exposure). T8 groups appeared more distant from T28 groups than GC from RPM, suggesting that time was generating more variance than SMG on BMSCs proteome.</p>
                <p id="Par15">GO annotation overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of the 481 DAPGs showed that 13 cellular component categories (GO-CC) were significantly enriched (Fig. S3). Interestingly, 49 DAPGs were mapped to the GO-CC ECM (<italic>p</italic> = 2.7 × 10<sup>–11</sup>), while 28 were mapped to the mitochondrial matrix (<italic>p</italic> = 3.1 × 10<sup>–3</sup>), 47 to the cell-substrate junction (<italic>p</italic> = 3.8 × 10<sup>–13</sup>), and 30 to the actin cytoskeleton (<italic>p</italic> = 1.5 × 10<sup>–3</sup>).</p>

Interestingly, many of these 20 DAPGs are under the control of stemness master regulators, such as POU5F1 and NANOG.</p>
                <p id="Par17">To understand how the SMG exposure was affecting PGs regulation over time, the 481 DAPGs were divided in a pie chart (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D) based on their regulation in SMG at 8 and 28 days. Of those 481 DAPGs, 15.2% (73 PGs) and 6.6% (32 PGs) were respectively down- and upregulated exclusively at T8, against the 3.5% (17 PGs) and 5.8% (28 PGs) that were, respectively, down- and upregulated solely at T28. An additional 5.8% (28 PGs) and 3.3% (16 PGs) were found down- and upregulated at both time points. The remaining 59.8% of DAPGs were attributed to the BMSCs maturation during time, comparing the conditions T8_GC vs T28_GC and T8_RPM with T28_RPM. This distribution highlighted the fact that a reduction in the overall metabolism of the BMSCs underwent at early time points (8 days) and was relieved at the 28th day. An increasing upregulation was instead present in these cells.</p>
                <p id="Par18">The enrichment analysis resulted in overrepresentation of 178 unique GO-BP terms (Table S3) and helped to narrow down the cellular processes mainly affected by SMG. These 178 GO-BPs were represented in four charts based on their down- and upregulation data, at 8 and 28 days (Fig. S4–S7). They presented redundant DAPGs in their list, but this also ensured that the biological significance of the proteins was not underestimated (as one protein can be, and usually is, involved in multiple pathways).</p>
                <p id="Par19">In general, the overall proteomics coverage was high with respect to previous works (4312 identified PGs). However, the GO-CCs annotation of the DAPGs highlighted a polarized enrichment of non-nuclear proteins. Results from the 481 DAPGs suggest that major changes occurred at early time points (8 days), with the 15.2% of all DAPGs being downregulated by SMG at 8 days.</p>

Among the enriching proteins, a significant reduction at 8 days in the expression of seven DAPGs (COL8A1, CSPG4, DYNC1H1, MTOR, NCSTN, PLPP3, and PRKDC) was followed by a significant upregulation at 28 days of 6 DAPGs (CCN1, FBLN5, NFKB2, NRP2, NSUN2, and SEMA3C) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Proliferation). Notice that CCN1 and FBLN5 were annotated to the GO-BP “positive regulation of osteoblast proliferation” (GO:0033690). MTOR and PRKDC can also be associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Differentially abundant protein groups (DAGPs) categorization under major GO biological processes.

                <p id="Par21">16 out of 27 DAPGs under the <italic>differentiation</italic> category (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Differentiation) were downregulated in RPM at 8 days (ATP1A1, ATP2B1, ATP2B4, CD47, COL11A1, COL3A1, COL6A3, FASN, HSPG2, ITGA1, ITGA11, MRC2, PTPN11, TMEM119, TNC, and VCAN), and only 6 of these were downregulated at 28 days (ATP1A1, ATP2B1, CD47, FASN, TMEM119, VCAN). All of these are annotated under or related to the GO-BP terms “osteoblast differentiation, ossification, skeletal system morphogenesis and bone development.” The other 11 DAPGs were found upregulated in RPM: 6 were upregulated at the earliest time point (ABR, ACTA1, LMNA, NSUN2, PAPSS1, PUS7) and 10 at the last time point (ABR, ACTA1, CCN1, FBLN5, LOXL1, NSUN2, PAPSS1, PUS7, SEMA3C, TGM2). Interestingly, MAP2K1 (also known as MAPKK 1, MKK1, ERK activator kinase 1, MAPK/ERK kinase 1, or MEK1) was found downregulated at 28 days with respect to 8 days, both in RPM and GC (Table S2). MAP2K1 can inhibit PPARG activity in the nucleus and repress adipogenic differentiation. A non-significant increase in MAP1K2 in RPM with respect to GC might suggest a mild reduction in adipogenesis (Table S2).</p>
                <p id="Par22">In the <italic>adhesion</italic> category (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Adhesion), there were 30 enriched GO-BPs. Among them, 14 were downregulated in RPM at 8 days (ATP2A2, CD151, CD47, COL12A1, COL3A1, COL8A1, CSPG4, FLNA, FLNB, ITGA1, ITGA11, LRP1, MYADM, PLEC, PLPP3, PTPN11, TLN1, TLN2, TNC, VCAN) and 5 of these were also downregulated at 28 days (CD151, CD47, COL8A1, MYADM, VCAN), indicating a reduction in overall cell adhesion and migration properties. Interestingly, the downregulated DAPGs enriched for the integrin-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0007229 by CD47, ITGA1, ITGA11, PLPP3, and PTPN11), hemidesmosome assembly (GO:0031581 by CD151 and PLEC), cytoskeleton organization (GO:0007010 by FLNB, TLN1, and TLN2) and ECM organization (GO:0030198 by COL8A1, TCN, and VCAN), suggest a reduction in BMSC adhesion and an overall reorganization of the cytoskeletal fibers at the early time point (8 days). ABR, SORBS1, and ZYX were upregulated at 8 days in RPM and 7 were upregulated at 28 days (ALCAM, CCN1, FBLN1, FBLN5, ICAM1, NRP2, SEMA3C). The early (8 days) upregulation of SORBS1 and ZYX, enriching for stress fiber assembly, was in line with results derived from F-actin bioimaging analysis. Indeed, following a sudden reduction in stress fibers (shown as reduction in the mean fluorescent intensity) at T1h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A), there was a reorganization and reformation of those fibers during the following days (fluorescent area and intensity increased already at day 4 and remained comparable to GC condition) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A-B). The later upregulation of DAPGs involved in cell migration (ALCAM, NRP2, SEMA3C) suggests BMSCs started migrating again once they reorganized the cytoskeleton and adapted to SMG.</p>
                <p id="Par23">In the <italic>signaling</italic> category (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Signaling), a total of 14 DAPGs were found, of which 8 were downregulated at 8 days (ABCC4, ATP2A2, CD47, COL3A1, MYADM, TNC, VCAN, WNK1) and 5 remained downregulated at 28 days. While 2 were upregulated at 8 days (ABR and MSN) and 4 were upregulated at 28 days in RPM (ABR, LOXL1, NRP2, PDK1). Among the proteins enriching the signaling category, 8 were also found to enrich the adhesion category (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Adhesion) (ABR, ATP2A2, CD47, COL3A3, MYADM, NRP2, TNC, VCAN). This was possibly due to the fact that a reduction in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal reorganization events was the stimulus and/or response to the microgravity signal.</p>
                <p id="Par24">6 DAPGs enriched the <italic>cell death</italic> category (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Among them MTOR was downregulated at 8 days, ENDOG and PAK2 were upregulated at 8 days, and CCN1, TIA1 and TIMP3 were upregulated at 28 days, indicating an overall upregulation of apoptosis. This is in line with the data on cell viable numbers, as we registered an almost constant number of alive BMSCs, due to a certain percentage of proliferation and a certain percentage of apoptosis.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Regarding the <italic>cell metabolism</italic> macro-category (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), we grouped the DAPGs involved in the metabolism of the different macromolecules. <italic>Carbohydrate</italic> metabolism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Carbohydrate) included simple and complex carbohydrates metabolic processes. In this category, CSPG4, DSE and VCAN were downregulated at 8 days, while SCARB2, SLC2A1 and VCAN were downregulated at 28 days. These proteins mostly enriched the biosynthetic pathways of lactose, chondroitin and dermatan sulfate biosynthesis (the last two being glycosaminoglycans—GAGs). PKM and SLC25A12 were upregulated at 8 days and PGM3 only at 28 days, which enriched glycolysis-related GO-BPs. Interestingly, PKM and SLC2A1 were also involved in the aerobic glycolysis pathway. PDK1 is upregulated at 28 days in RPM with respect to GC, and PDK3 and PC are upregulated at 28 days with respect to 8 days, in both RPM and GC (Table S2). PFKL and PFKP were downregulated in both conditions at 28 days with respect to 8 days (Table S2).</p>
                <p id="Par26">Among the 11 DAPGs enriching <italic>lipid-</italic>related metabolic processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Lipids), 8 were downregulated at 8 days (ACSL1, ALOX15B, ATP1A1, CEPT1, FASN, LRP1, SLC44A1, SLC44A2) and 6 at 28 days (ACSL1, ALOX15B, ATP1A1, CEPT1, FASN, SLC44A1). These downregulated proteins generally enriched lipid or lipidated molecules biosynthesis-related pathways. Only ß-oxidation-related proteins were found upregulated (ACOX1 and CRAT at 8 days and ACOX3 and CRAT at 28 days), and the leptin receptor (LEPR) was found upregulated at T28 in RPM with respect to T8 in RPM (Table S2), suggesting an increase in the basal metabolism undergoing in RPM at 28 days. Furthermore, ACADM, which is the catalyst for the first step of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, was upregulated at 28 days in both conditions, while ACAA2, the catalyst for the last step of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway, was downregulated at 28 days with respect to 8 days in both conditions (Table S2). So, overall lipid-related proteins suggest a general downregulation of lipid biosynthesis and upregulation of lipid degradation by oxidation, which is in line with a general spike of the basal metabolism.</p>
                <p id="Par27">In the <italic>protein metabolism</italic>-related pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Proteins), we found a total of 35 DAPGs. The DAPGs involved in protein N-glycosylation (DAD1, OSTC, STT3A, TUSC3), regulation of translational initiation (EIF4A2, MTOR, NCBP1) and other protein modification processes were downregulated in RPM, while DAPGs involved in the elastic fiber formation processes were upregulated (FBLN1, LOX1, LOX4, TIMP3). The synthesis of biglycan (BGN), bone-related proteoglycan, is significantly increased in RPM at 28 days (Table S2).</p>
                <p id="Par28">In the <italic>transport</italic>-related processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Transport), we annotated 26 different DAPGs, and 22 of these were downregulated against the four DAPGs upregulated by SMG (ABR, EHD4, KRT18, NSF). 10 of the downregulated DAPGs were annotated to pathways of export from the cells and 4 are involved in calcium ion transport (ATP1A1, ATP2B1, ATP2B4, and ATP2C1).</p>
                <p id="Par29">Regarding the <italic>nucleic acids</italic> metabolic processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Nucleic acids), we found several DAPGs involved in RNA modification upregulated (NSUN2, QARS, SNRPE, SSB, WARS) in RPM, while DNA metabolic processes were mostly linked to DAPGs downregulated by RPM (CAD, MTOR, PRKDC). In contrast to the general tendency of having more downregulated proteins in RPM, in this category composed of 12 DAPGs, only 5 were downregulated and 7 upregulated.</p>

              <p id="Par30">Characterizing the effects of microgravity exposure on in vivo models is challenging and is limited by a number of factors. The design and development of ground-based microgravity simulators, such as RPM, has improved the chances for microgravity study and allowed the in-house exposure and analysis of biological samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par31">Contrasting data on osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs are present in the literature due to a remarkable variability attributed both to the experimental settings and the model used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par32">In our study, proteomics data and cell viability suggested that apoptosis was occurring to some extent but that it was not significant, as previously indicated by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Proliferative processes (also enriching the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) were reduced at 8 days, followed by an upregulation at 28 days of other DAPGs involved in proliferation and specifically osteoblast proliferation pathways, suggesting a “change of course” for BMSCs. This is partially in line with what was found by Bucaro et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], even if their experimental model was different from ours: they used MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells included in alginate carriers and NASA-engineered high aspect ratio vessel (HARV).</p>
              <p id="Par33">SELENON, a protective component against oxidative stress, was upregulated in the present study, suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in SMG, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par34">Chen et al., showed that rat BMSCs, analyzed on a 2D-clinostat for 48 h, showed F-actin depolarization and that this was reflected on the inactivation of TAZ and consequent TAZ impairment translocating to the nucleus. TAZ is a transcription factor involved in the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs; therefore, its inactivation affected BMSCs differentiation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Similarly, in our study, we identified a reduced mean intensity of F-actin fibers, supporting the F-actin depolarization conclusion, and found that BMSCs exhibited a reduced, but not completely impaired, osteoblastic differentiation capacity. Cytoskeletal rearrangements were studied in a different work, in connection with mTOR regulation in murine BMSCs, and it was shown that mechanical stress elicited an increase in the mTOR synthesis, causing a stiffening of the cytoskeleton and thereby promoting osteoblastic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Decreased expression of MTOR was caused by SMG and this might trigger the cytoskeletal rearrangement. Reduced gene expression markers and protein markers for osteoblastogenesis, both at early and late time points, indicated a general decline of this differentiation process, as shown by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, MAP2K1 is involved in the promotion of adipogenesis by exporting PPARG transcription factor from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reducing its gene regulatory activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Its downregulation (MAP2K1) in time was present in both experimental conditions, and we found a non-significant increase in SMG, suggesting a mild reduction in the adipogenic differentiation. Indeed, genes controlled by PPARG, like FABP3, and PLIN2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and involved in adipogenesis, such as AEBP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], were not upregulated by SMG. Rather, their expression was promoted with time, in both GC and RPM conditions.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Proteomic data also showed a reduction in the enzymes involved in protein synthesis, glycosylation of proteins and synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Carbohydrates). GAGs play a pivotal role in connective tissues, including in the case of bone and cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. They are crucial for the organization of the ECM and for the signaling from the ECM to the cells. DCN concentration measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) did not register significant differences, although the dermatan sulfate epimerase (DSE) enzyme was found downregulated, suggesting an impaired glycosylation of DCN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Novel markers of osteoblastic differentiation of human BMSCs recently identified by other studies include SLC44A1 (also known as CD10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and MME (also known as CD92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, these markers were found to increase during the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and our results showed that these proteins were downregulated under SMG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C and Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>—Proteins, respectively). CD109 was also associated with mature OBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and PTPN11 KO mice exhibited osteopenia phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We reported their downregulation at 8 days and upregulation or non-significant variations at 28 days, in SMG with respect to GC.</p>
              <p id="Par36">ALPL is an early osteogenic differentiation marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] whose expression and biosynthesis is constantly upregulated in differentiating osteoblasts up to the 28th day of differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Its activity is essential for the mineralization of the ECM since it provides the inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) for hydroxyapatite crystal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The downregulation of its gene expression and activity under SMG is congruent with the reduction in matrix mineralization. Furthermore, <italic>ALPL</italic> expression under SMG is downregulated with respect to GC, but it is not completely erased. Interestingly, we found TMEM63A among the ten mostly downregulated in differentiating BMSCs under SMG, and there are very few citations linking TMEM63A to the bone in the current literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. TMEM63A is a mechanosensitive cation channel capable of converting the mechanical stimulus of pressure into a calcium flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Interestingly, Sun and colleagues showed a reduced intracellular free calcium concentration in mouse primary osteoblasts under simulated microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We can speculate that this mechanosensitive calcium channel might be linked to the mechanotransduction of the SMG, by reducing the calcium flow entering the cells. Consequently, when mineralization was assessed in terms of crystal number, crystal size and alizarin red staining, it was found reduced in SMG but not absent, as evidenced by a constant increase in ALPL activity during the experimental timeline was registered both in GC and RPM conditions. In accordance with this observation, ELISA results also showed the upregulation at 8 days of SPP1, an osteoblastic marker acting as a mineralization inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and it was demonstrated that its deletion inhibited unloading-related bone loss in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Moreover, DAPGs enriching export pathways, and specifically calcium ion export, were downregulated in SMG. Other proteins known to be involved in the mineralization process as components of the matrix vesicles (MVs) are differentially regulated (ANXA6 and NT5DC3 were upregulated, while ATP1A1 and SCARB2 were downregulated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. ATP1A1 was found in vesicles produced by rat osteoblasts, called “osteosomes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and was also found upregulated in human BMSCs differentiation into osteoblasts in vitro, by Granéli et al., together with MME and SLC44A1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par37">The upregulation at 8 days of SORBS1 and ZYX, enriching for stress fiber assembly, was in line with the results of bioimaging analysis on F-actin. Stress fiber study showed the maximum depolarization (lowest fluorescence intensity) after 1 h of exposure to SMG, as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The reorganization of the cytoskeleton and reformation of those fibers occurred during the following days (fluorescent area and intensity increased already at day 4 and remained comparable to GC condition). Further upregulation of DAPGs involved in cell migration (ALCAM, NRP2, SEMA3C) suggested BMSCs started migrating again once they reorganized the cytoskeleton and adapted to SMG.</p>
              <p id="Par38">A specific investigation to characterize the energetic and metabolic status of BMSCs during SMG exposure was not performed, although noteworthy PGs were identified within the proteomics data. MT-ATP6, the subunit A of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F1F0 ATP synthase or Complex V), resulted as downregulated by SMG as previously reported for a different cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], but not for osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. MT-ATP6 was also found particularly upregulated during the mechanical stimulation of tumoral osteoblasts (MG-63), in connection with an increased oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In our study we showed the downregulation of MT-ATP6 in SMG, as one of the ten mostly downregulated proteins. Furthermore, several other ATP-dependent transporters were downregulated by SMG (ABCC3, ABCC4, ATP1A1, ATP2B1). Guntur et al., recently showed that differentiating immortalized osteoblasts (MT3T3-E1) switch their metabolism on the glycolytic pathway, downregulating oxidative phosphorylation during the differentiation, while 3T3L1 adipocytes stick to the oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In our study, proteins involved in glycolysis, such as PDK1, PDK3 and PKM were found upregulated by SMG, suggesting the energetic metabolism was supporting the osteoblastic differentiation. However, we have also shown that proteins participating in the mitochondrial ß-oxidation (ACOX1, ACOX3, CRAT) were upregulated, suggesting the accumulation of acetyl-CoA and reducing equivalents in SMG, which is more prominent in adipocytes. At the same time, the biosynthesis of both carbohydrates and lipids was downregulated in SMG. The dysregulation of energy metabolism pathways can also be linked to the differential regulation of MTOR and protein glycosylation pathways, an association that has already been investigated in the past for conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par39">Considering the general picture, we can say that SMG exposure causes an initial acute response consisting in reduced cell adhesion, possibly triggered by a reduction in the pressure perceived by the cells, through the mechanotransduction provided by TMEM63A. This leads to cytoskeletal rearrangements and consequent decline in osteogenic differentiation and osteogenic potential, but it does not cause a complete termination of the osteogenic differentiation. In line with what registered in vivo, under real microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], our results showed the presence of osteogenic marker expression and mineralization even after 28 days of SMG, in a reduced fashion with respect to the GC condition. Also, the mechanotransduction of SMG stimulus resonates on the energy metabolism, possibly activating it, and therefore preserving the high energy required for osteoblastic differentiation.</p>
              <p id="Par40">It may be possible for us to gain a deeper understanding of the differentiation process by the exploitation of nanomaterials. Our previous studies demonstrated that the application of exogenous calcium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nCa-HAPs) control the differentiation kinetics of bone mineralization on BMSCs in physiological conditions. While the application of stable suspensions of strontium hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (nSr-HAPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] would restrict or reverse the molecular changes caused by simulated microgravity in BMSCs exposed to the space environment. Therefore, the functional characterization of nCa- or nSr-HAPs on this in vitro model is required for a detailed molecular knowledge of the system, to understand how comparable the two systems (real vs SMG) might be, and to design new pharmacological countermeasures to treat osteoporosis.</p>

              <title>Conclusions and future perspectives</title>
              <p id="Par41">In this work, the effects of long-term SMG exposure were studied for the first time with a shotgun proteomic approach on a well-characterized in vitro osteoblastic differentiation model based on human primary BMSCs. The influence of SMG on osteoblastic differentiation was highlighted with a temporal pattern analysis: at 8 and 28 days. We can summarize our findings by recounting the two process phases that BMSC undergo in our standardized model when subjected to SMG. There is an initial acute phase, occurring during the first 8 days involving cytoskeleton rearrangement, most probably triggered by the reduced expression of a mechanosensitive calcium channel (TMEM63A or CSC-like protein 1), and a consequent reduction in osteogenic differentiation potential. This is followed by a second phase, from day 8 to day 28, which is characterized by the remarkable plasticity of these cells and which demonstrates that BMSCs in vitro are able to adapt to the stimulus. BMSCs do mineralize the ECM, but their energy metabolism remains altered. We also highlighted how the exposure to SMG was contemporarily affecting a limited number of proteins with respect to the set of proteins regulated by osteogenic factors.</p>
              <p id="Par42">In the future, nanotechnological applications promoting osteogenic differentiation might be used on this model. Furthermore, a new hypothesis involving the coculture of BMSCs with osteocytes, the mechanosensors of the bone, might shed light on the paracrine control of osteoblasts differentiation under SMG. These theories and others need to be the objects of further studies.</p>

                <p id="Par44">The study design was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committees of the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo and the University of Pavia (2011). Human BMSCs were isolated from bone marrow (BM) aspirates as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Briefly, BM aspirates were harvested in pediatric clinics from three healthy adult donors, after obtaining written informed consent, and 30 ml of them were designated to BMSCs isolation. Mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized BM aspirates (30 ml) by Ficoll density gradient (density, 1.077 g/ml; Lymphoprep, Nycomed Pharma, Norway) and plated in non-coated 75–175 cm<sup>2</sup> polystyrene culture flasks (Corning Costar, Celbio, Italy) at a density of 1.6 ∙ 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm. After 48 h, nonadherent cells were discarded and culture medium was replaced twice a week. Once the 80% of confluence was reached, the cells were harvested and replated for expansion at a density of 4000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in a continuous way until the third passage. Up to this point, cells were cultured in mesencult medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Canada) supplemented with 2-mM L-glutamine, 50-mg/ml gentamicin, and 10% v/v FCS. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified and CO<sub>2</sub> (5%) conditioned atmosphere. According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy on the nomenclature of mesenchymal progenitors, the cells cultured for this study were defined as multipotent stromal cells. To phenotypically characterize BMSCs and to define their purity, FACS analysis was performed as previously indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

The osteogenic medium was composed by α-MEM (Minimum Essential Medium) (ECM0849L, Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FBS (FBS,180 l, Lonza), 2-mM L-glutamine, 2% v/v sodium pyruvate, 1% v/v penicillin–streptomycin, 0.2% v/v fungizone, 2% HEPES, and three osteogenic factors: 100-nM dexamethasone, 5-mM β-glycerophosphate, and 50-mg/ml ascorbic acid. The medium was changed every 4 days; to allow medium renewal of the SMG samples, the RPM was stopped for less than 5 min every time. The differentiation was definitely terminated at T28. Osteogenic differentiation was studied directly and contemporary in GC condition and in SMG, by using the RPM (Dutch Space) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

Data were initially categorized based on the time of collection (T0, T8 and T28) and the culturing conditions (GC and RPM) of the samples, resulting in five different groups (each with three replicates, except for the T8_GC which only had two). The categorized data went through several steps: 1. the intensities of each protein group (PG) in the T0 replicates were averaged; 2. PGs intensities of all samples (except the T0) were rationed on the T0 mean intensities and T0 replicates were not considered for subsequent analysis; 3. The matrix was filtered for valid values (70% in at least one category), log2 transformed and missing data were imputed on the base of their Gaussian distribution (Fig. S2). One-way ANOVA was applied at this point to retrieve statistically significant differences among PG intensities relative to the four groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the correction for multiple-dependent variables is considered by the Perseus software, and we used Permutation-based False Discovery Rate, with 250 repetitions, accepting a 5% of false-positive DAPGs (error rate = 0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Multiple comparisons (Tukey’s honestly significant difference test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was run on the 486 differentially abundant PGs (DAPGs) and average differences were annotated. The PGs and DAPGs were labeled using the official gene names, which were univocally recognizable by the different software and repositories used. The 486 DAPGs were manually controlled to remove redundant gene names referring to uncharacterized isoforms. The list was, therefore, reduced to 481 DAPGs (Table S2). GO annotation overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of the 481 DAPGs for the cellular component categories was performed with the WebGestalt online tool, setting a significant threshold at <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05.
