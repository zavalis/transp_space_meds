                <p id="Par1">Adaptation of humans in low gravity conditions is a matter of utmost importance when efforts are on to a gigantic leap in human space expeditions for tourism and formation of space colonies. In this connection, cardiovascular adaptation in low gravity is a critical component of human space exploration. Deep high-throughput sequencing approach allowed us to analyze the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cultured under gravity (G), and stimulated microgravity (MG) achieved with a clinostat. The present study identified totally 1870 miRNAs differentially expressed in HUVEC under MG condition when compared to the cells subjected to unitary G conditions. The functional association of identified miRNAs targeting specific mRNAs revealed that miRNAs, hsa-mir-496, hsa-mir-151a, hsa-miR-296-3p, hsa-mir-148a, hsa-miR-365b-5p, hsa-miR-3687, hsa-mir-454, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-145-5p differentially regulated the genes involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell cycle, JAK-STAT signaling, MAPK signaling, nitric oxide signaling, VEGF signaling, and wound healing pathways. Further, the q-PCR based experimental studies of upregulated and downregulated miRNA and mRNAs demonstrate that the above reported miRNAs influence the cell proliferation and vascular functions of the HUVEC in MG conditions effectively. Consensus on the interactome results indicates restricted fluctuations in the transcriptome of the HUVEC exposed to short-term MG that could lead to higher levels of endothelial functions like angiogenesis and vascular patterning.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Human physiology including the cardiovascular system has adapted to the constant orientation of the Earth’s gravity field (static stimulation) and gravity vector (dynamic stimulation) throughout evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the era of rapid space exploration, it is obvious to experience the change in gravity by the human body. The cardiovascular system is one of the major systems affected due to the change in gravity among musculoskeletal, pulmonary, and immune systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Besides changes in the heart’s function, mass and shape, the vasculature is also affected under low gravity causing disturbed vascular tone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Endothelium produces several vasoactive signaling molecules, such as VEGF, nitric oxide, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II to control vasomotor responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Endothelium acts as mechano-transducers and responds to the mechanical and gravitational forces by undergoing various cytoskeletal changes that activate second messenger cascades, which, in turn, may act on specific response elements of affected genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The real microgravity can be achieved by the use of rockets, space crafts, space labs, and parabolic flights. However, the limited number of missions and high costs lower the possibility to perform experiments in real microgravity. To overcome these limitations, clinostats are used to simulate microgravity. Similarities in the observed biological effects between space labs and clinostat-MG have been established by various studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In this study, we used our previously described 3D clinostat to simulate microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">A series of studies including our own for the last two decades showed that MG modulates endothelial and vascular functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. All these ground-based and a few studies in space conditions further support the fact that astronauts spending a long time in International Space Station (ISS) are vulnerable to vasculopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Recent NASA Twin Study observed an increase in the ratio of plasma levels of apolipoprotein B, a major constituent of LDL particles, to apolipoprotein A1, a major constituent of high-density lipoprotein particles during the 6 months inflight compared with preflight and early inflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This observation indicates an association of the APOB/APOA1 ratio with the long duration of the mission, and thereby affecting the cardiovascular health of the astronauts. However, the onset and process of vascular remodeling in low gravity conditions, particularly how the gravity modulation is translated into vascular remodeling, is still unknown.</p>
              <p id="Par4">We deem that vascular plexus senses microgravity mechanically, and induces alteration in the genome of the vasculature to adapt to the low gravity conditions. Collective information from MG experiments indicates the cells attaining a new equilibrium of gene expression and forming a distinct gene networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Although high throughput genomics techniques are available with scientific diaspora, no specific information is available in the database of space shuttle studies and ground-level experiments for genome-wide exploration of novel microRNA and its relationship with genome-wide transcriptome in vascular perspective. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded, highly conserved, small noncoding RNAs with an average of ~22 nucleotide bases. They function by directly binding to the 3′ un-translated region (3′ UTR) of specific target messenger RNA (mRNA) or transcript sequences, thus leading to the reduction of protein expression by inhibiting mRNA translation and/or promoting target mRNA degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The wide varieties of miRNAs play a significant role in regulating endothelial cell (EC) development, activation, vascular inflammation, and the initiation of atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Recent studies offer proof for the importance of miRNAs in EC by knocking down the Dicer, a miRNA processing enzyme that resulted in severe attenuation of angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Earlier studies also showed that a series of miRNAs namely miR-126, miR-19a, and miR-21 target vascular specific genes such as VCAM-1, cyclinD1, and eNOS, thereby regulating angiogenesis pathways, response to shear stress, cellular proliferation, and NO production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Since, the microgravity influences the phenotypic and gene expression of the EC, we hypothesize that the MG interferes with the expression of miRNA, their gene targets/transcript and their inter-relationship to tune the angiogenesis process. Therefore, the systematic interpretation of high-throughput methods might be a powerful tool to understand the underlying complex mechanisms of vascular modulation in space.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In the present study, we investigate the effects of short-term (2 h) MG on cellular functions of ECs, their mRNA and small RNA expressions using deep sequencing techniques to identify the mechano-sensor miRNA/genes. The differential expression studies further tracked the expression profile of endothelium miRNAs in the MG conditions specifically to target the genes involved in angiogenesis and associated endothelial activation steps.</p>

                <p id="Par8">Monolayers of HUVEC were exposed to G and MG, respectively for 2 h followed by an overnight incubation, and after the overnight incubation, the cells were tested for viability, migration, and cell morphology. Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) staining indicates an increase in the number of live cells treated with 2 h MG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1 a, b</xref>). MG effects of migration of the HUVEC were tested on a monolayer of cells with a scratch wound. The wounds in the monolayer of the HUVEC healed significantly faster after 4 and 8 h of MG exposure when compared to that of G condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). Next, Boyden chamber cell migration assay, using a 3D transwell chamber indicates augmented migration properties of the MG treated cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). Further, the fluorescence imaging of HUVEC exposed to MG for 2 h, with and without cytochalasin, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, which is a representative panel, indicates significant increases in filopodia and lamellipodia formation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Sprouting from the chick embryo aortic explants exposed to G and MG in Matrigel represents higher order organizational function of the HUVEC. This experiment depicts that MG triggers angiogenesis cue in the endothelium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Effect of simulated MG on cell viability using FDA staining.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Gravity and microgravity treated cells were examined for the presence of live cells using FDA staining.

                <p id="Par13">To study the functional activities of conserved miRNAs in angiogenesis, the target genes were predicted, and their gene functions were enriched to determine the miRNA involvement in endothelial development and other related pathways. The gene ontology (GO) study revealed that the enriched target functions were mostly associated with cell proliferation, cell signaling, and transcriptional regulation mechanism. Further, the secondary pathway information shows that the genes targeted by the miRNAs were involved in pathways such as VEGF signaling, nitric oxide, MAPK signaling, adherens, angiogenesis, cell cycle, Jak-STAT signaling, focal adhesion, and wound healing mechanism whose genes were up or downregulated. The gene network analysis showed that the following miRNAs hsa-mir-200c-3p, hsa-mir-423-5p, and hsa-mir-939-5p in both samples (G and MG) were targeting multiple genes involved in PI3-Akt signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a, b</xref>). The differential expression of genes associated with PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, targeted by the above listed miRNAs is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c, d</xref>. Interestingly, we found genes like JAK, ITGA, ECM, P13K, and GSK3 were down regulated in MG. Similarly, PEPCK, AMPK, BCAP, and TCL1 were upregulated in MG.

              <p id="Par15">In the present study, we investigated the expression profile of miRNAs and mRNAs of human ECs under G and MG conditions. Studying the transcriptome along with the miRNA profile aids in gaining insights into the molecular basis of the interactions occurring during transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation brought about by low gravity in endothelium. It provides an opportunity to integrate changes in coding mRNAs with noncoding RNAs which regulate the mRNA expression. Experimental set up in the present study simulates microgravity for a relatively shorter time span (2 h). Our previous studies optimized 2 h as the optimal time of treatment with MG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par16">The aim of the present study was to decipher the genomic get of the endothelium under short exposure to MG. Shorter treatment time is a lucrative parameter for biotechnological and clinical uses of the sensitized cells. A shorter duration exposure to MG is also critical to understand the implications of short distance space travel in endothelial functions. The next generation deep sequencing approach was taken to characterize the potential known and novel miRNAs involved in angiogenesis pathways in MG conditions. The adapter trimmed length plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) shows that Illumina sequenced sample reads were optimal with a length of 21–24 bp and 50–60% of unique reads were utilized for known miRNA and novel miRNA identification. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> clearly shows that all the other non-coding RNAs like as t-RNA, r-RNA, sn-RNA, sno-RNA, and pi-RNA were properly filtered from samples prior to the miRNA identification.

The present study identified 2160 and 2078 miRNA in G and MG treated ECs, of which 80% of miRNAs were commonly expressed among the samples. This infers that the majority of miRNAs are crucial in maintaining cellular physiology in HUVEC. Interestingly, it was observed that 52 up-regulated and 48 downregulated miRNAs were differentially expressed under MG. The highly expressed miRNA, <bold>hsa-miR-148a-3p</bold>, is likely to be involved in NF-κB signaling, and inflammatory gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> another miRNA hsa-mir-215 is capable of regulating fibrotic processes, cell cycle, and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. <bold>hsa-miR-199b-5p</bold> is highly expressed in tumor tissues from patients with pancreatic cancer.

The present study reveals that the upregulated miRNAs in MG conditions are predominantly expressed in the events of cell cycle, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. Similarly, the downregulated miRNA, miR-145-5p, plays a crucial role in regulating the genes involved in gap junction communication of microvascular ECs, and thereby inhibiting angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. miR-145, which is downregulated in various types of cancer serves as a tumor-suppressor by affecting multiple signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

The present study discovers 8 and 17 potential miRNAs from G and MG samples, respectively, by mapping reads with the human genome (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The putative gene targets of predicted novel miRNAs were related to cell cycle, cell proliferation, fibrogenesis, and angiogenesis processes. The correlation studies of G and MG based on log2 fold change value elucidates the mechanism of miRNA and their target regulation. Pathway network analysis revealed that <bold>hsa-mir-423-5p</bold>, <bold>hsa-mir-200c-3p</bold>, <bold>hsa-mir-939-5p</bold> from G and MG samples were found to be predominantly expressed in regulating PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

              <p id="Par18">We generated a circos plot that clearly illustrated the expression correlation between functionally active miRNAs that were targeting transcripts involved in angiogenesis, VEGF signaling, nitric oxide signaling, wound healing, adherens, MAPK signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, focal adhesion, and cell cycle.

Hence, ground-based simulators of microgravity are important tools for space experiments. However, the earth-based simulators warrant comparison with the data obtained from the space station.

Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and TNF signaling pathways were affected in cells under MG, space-flight conditions and in the TWIN study as well. Notably, CSF2 levels, which increased during in-flight and 6 months after return, were also up-regulated in our study. In addition, the gene-expression levels of other inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL5, CXCL1, LIF were significantly upregulated in accordance with the TWIN study observations. Other genes, TRAF1, JAG1, IL6, and PTGS2 involved in TNF signaling were upregulated, thus causing a strong imbalance in the cytokine biology adding support to the TWIN study.</p>

These indications prompt us to hypothesize that short term exposure of ECs to MG will define the course of wound healing and production of tissue engineered blood vessels in the laboratory.</p>
