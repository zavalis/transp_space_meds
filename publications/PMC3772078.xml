              <abstract>
                <p>Adult stem cells can differentiate into multiple lineages depending on their exposure to differing biochemical and biomechanical inductive factors. Lack of mechanical signals due to disuse can inhibit osteogenesis and induce adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Long-term bed rest due to both brain/spinal cord injury and space travel can lead to disuse osteoporosis that is in part caused by a reduced number of osteoblasts. Thus, it is essential to provide proper mechanical stimulation for cellular viability and osteogenesis, particularly under disuse conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived human stem cells (Ad-hMSC) in simulated microgravity conditions. Cells were cultured in a 1D clinostat to simulate microgravity (SMG) and treated with LIPUS at 30mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 20 min/day. It was hypothesized that the application of LIPUS to SMG cultures would restore osteogenesis in Ad-hMSCs. The results showed significant increases in ALP, OSX, RANKL, RUNX2, and decreases in OPG in LIPUS treated SMG cultures of Ad-MSC compared to non-treated cultures. LIPUS also restored OSX, RUNX2 and RANKL expression in osteoblast cells. SMG significantly reduced ALP positive cells by 70% (p&lt;0.01) and ALP activity by 22% (p&lt;0.01), while LIPUS treatment restored ALP positive cell number and activity to equivalence with normal gravity controls. Extracellular matrix collagen and mineralization was assessed by Sirius red and Alizarin red staining, respectively. SMG cultures showed little or no collagen or mineralization, but LIPUS treatment restored collagen content to 50% (p&lt;0.001) and mineralization by 45% (p&lt;0.001) in LIPUS treated-SMG cultures relative to SMG-only cultures. The data suggest that LIPUS treatment can restore normal osteogenic differentiation of MSCs from disuse by daily short duration stimulation.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into osteoblastic, adipogenic, myogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Recent studies have examined the effects of the presence or absence of mechanical stimuli on commitment of MSCs to different lineages [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Mechanical vibrations, stress, and shear forces can all enhance osteogenic differentiation of MSCs while the lack of mechanical stimuli can induce adipogenesis [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Luu et al. have shown that low magnitude mechanical stimulation (LMMS) induces osteogenesis and inhibit adipogenesis [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. MSCs extracted from LMMS treated mice showed increased expression of RUNX2 relative to PPARγ [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A recent study by Yang et al. has shown that cyclic tensile strain increased RUNX2 expression while inhibiting PPARγ in rat MSCs [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast, lack of mechanical stress can induce adipogenesis and inhibit osteogenesis [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Loss of gravity in space or lack of physical activity due to spinal/brain injury can significantly reduce mechanical stresses thus leading to decreased rates of osteogenesis and increased rates of adipogenesis [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The lack of mechanical stress during spaceflight induces bone loss of 1-2% per month, which can eventually lead to disuse osteoporosis [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>MSCs are progenitor cells to osteoblasts, and the detrimental effects of disuse on MSCs can significantly reduce their rates of proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Microarray analysis of MSC cultures in simulated microgravity (SMG) have shown reductions in expression of genes controlling the cell cycle, cytoskeleton, proliferation, and differentiation along with increased expression of apoptotic genes [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, MSCs cultured in SMG had disorganized microfilaments and reduced F-actin polymerization [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Huang et al. have shown that this is in part due to inhibition of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways, leading to reductions in proliferation, RUNX2, and ALP concomitant with increased PPARγ levels [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In general, lack of mechanical stimulus appears to force MSCs into a state of quiescence.</p>
              <p>To restore MSCs self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation, it is essential to provide an anabolic mechanical signal, ideally one that provides a localized mechanical stimulus. LIPUS produces pressure waves that induce biochemical events in bone cells [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The effects of LIPUS on intercellular activity, cytokine release [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], gene expression [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], calcium mineralization [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Akt signaling [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], potassium influx [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], angiogenesis [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], adenyl cyclase activity, and TGF-b synthesis [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have all been studied.</p>
              <p>LIPUS induced mechanical deformations activate receptors on cell membranes such as integrins, mechanosensitive-calcium channels, G-proteins, IGF, TGF-β/BMP and gap junctions, activating different downstream pathways [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These studies, as well as many others, show that rates of bone formation are increased in the presence of LIPUS.</p>
              <p>Several studies have specifically evaluated the effects of ultrasound on mechanotransductive pathways. Tang et al. reported on activation of the Akt pathway and P-13-kinase, through aggregation of integrin expression, which resulted in induction of nitric oxide, hypoxia inducible factor-1, and increased activity of COX-2 in osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, LIPUS treated osteoblasts show higher nuclear localization of β-catenin and activation of Wnt signaling [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A microarray study done on LIPUS-treated osteoblasts showed enhanced gene expression of integrins, cytoskeletal components, TGF-β family members, IGF family members, MAPKs pathway, ATP-related, Guanine nucleotide binding protein family, lysyl genes, and apoptosis-associated gene families as compared to non-treated osteoblast [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These cellular level studies indicate that ultrasound treatment can activate mechanotransductive pathways and significantly increase osteogenic differentiation in progenitor cells and promote osteogenic maturity in differentiated osteoblasts. Recent studies have also shown increased RUNX2, ALP, Collagen type 1, and integrin beta 1 expression in LIPUS treated MSCs [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally LIPUS exposure has been shown to enhance cell adhesion, focal adhesion formation, and increase proliferation in MSCs [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>The catabolic effects of disuse are driven by inactivation of mechanotransductive pathways, leading to reduced MSC activity. The mechanotransductive properties of LIPUS have the potential to induce mechanical stress in MSCs and promote osteogenic differentiation in microgravity or disuse conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that LIPUS exposure restores the osteogenic differentiation of SMG cultured MSCs under simulated cellular microgravity.</p>

Lee Silver et al. explained in detail the effects of 1-D rotation on cells and sub-cellular organelles with respect to gravity, in which the authors demonstrated how continuous rotation along the horizontal axis both disables cells’ ability to respond to gravitational forces and induces a lack of orientation [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A variable speed motor controls the rotator. The holder is 80 mm (radius = 40mm) in width, allowing it to hold eight Opticell® (Nunc, VWR, Bridgeport, NJ, USA) cartridges, resulting in a radial force of less than 0.045 N.</p>

                <p>Sonicator® 740 (Mettler Electronics, Anaheim, CA) with a 10 cm<sup>2</sup> transducer (35 mm diameter) was used for LIPUS stimulation, utilizing a modified repetitive frequency at 100 Hz pulse, an ultrasound characteristic frequency of 1 MHz and a pulse width of 200 μs repeated at 100 Hz at an intensity of 30 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 20 minutes/day(I<sub>SATA</sub>). The region of LIPUS treatment was marked with a 10 cm diameter circle before the start of each experiment. All stimulations targeted the same region of each Opticell (each Opticell cartilage was stimulated individually), and only those cells that were growing in the Region of Stimulation (RoS) were harvested and analyzed.

Cells were distributed into five groups (n=4/group): 1) Control; 2) Gravity (G); 3) Gravity + LIPUS (GU); 4) SMG (M); and 5) SMG + LIPUS (MU). All the groups were initially cultured in proliferation media (StemLife media) until 90% confluency was reached. After 90%, GU, M, and MU groups were supplemented with osteogenic factors (50 ug/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM beta-glycerolphosphate), while the control group was maintained in proliferation media to serve as a negative control for osteogenesis. Microgravity simulation of M and MU groups was started after initiation of osteogenic induction. GU and MU samples were stimulated with LIPUS for 20 min per day, 5 days a week, for the duration of the experiments while the G and M samples were placed on a switched-off transducer for the same duration.</p>

                <p>PCR analyses were completed to assess the effects of SMG and LIPUS on the expression of osteogenic genes. SMG significantly reduced expression of all the genes analyzed (ALP, RUNX2, OSX, RANKL, and OPG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Application of LIPUS increased gene expression of ALP, RUNX2, OSX, RANKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g002">Figure 2a-d</xref>), and reduced expression of OPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). MU samples showed significant increases in expression of ALP, RUNX2, OSX and RANKL relative to M samples, and restored the expression of these genes to levels observed in G samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g002">Figure 2a-d</xref>). In the GU samples, LIPUS exposure showed positive correlations with osteogenic gene expression but no significant differences were found relative to G cultures. OPG expression levels reduced significantly with application of LIPUS in the GU and MU samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g002">Figure 2e</xref>). When combined with RANKL expression, an increased RANKL/OPG ratio was seen following application of LIPUS, with the highest ratio seen in GU and MU samples. This finding suggests that LIPUS stimulation favors bone formation over bone resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g002">Figure 2f</xref>).</p>

                <p>Collagen deposited by osteoblasts was measured using Sirius red (stains collagen, predominantly type I and III fibers). Histological/qualitative analyses showed a reduction in collagen level in the SMG exposed samples (M) and significant recovery due to stimulation with LIPUS (MU), as evidenced by dark red clusters of collagen evenly distributed throughout the RoS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). The application of LIPUS on the GU samples resulted in a significant increase in collagen secretion as compared to the control (G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). In addition, while all three cultures, G, GU and MU showed variable collagen density (with scattered areas of lower and denser clusters of collagen), the M cultures showed weaker staining and overall low collagen density throughout the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073914-g005">Figure 5a</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Recent studies have shown that both mechanical and biochemical stimuli are important for differentiation of stem cells into different lineages. Lack of mechanical stress significantly reduces a MSC’s capability to differentiate into an osteoblast, which may lead to disuse osteoporosis. Furthermore, Yamazaki et al. showed that a lack of mechanical stress can inhibit osteogenesis and induce adipogenesis in bone marrow MSCs [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. MSCs play an important role in bone remodeling, as they are the progenitor cells to osteoblast cells, and also affecting osteoclastogenesis through regulation of OPG. The study was designed to evaluate the effects of LIPUS as a potential countermeasure to MG induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. LIPUS is an acoustic pressure wave capable of providing localized mechanical stimulation that leads to activation of cell membrane bounded stretch receptors, ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors and integrins. The preliminary results have demonstrated that acoustic force can serve as a form of mechanical signals to trigger cell osteogenesis. In the presence of biochemical and mechanical stimuli, MSCs differentiate into bone matrix secreting osteoblasts, characterized by elevated expression of ALP, Runx2, OSX, and RANKL, along with secretion of matrix proteins. The present study confirmed the inhibitory effects of SMG on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs; SMG cultures showed reduced expression of ALP, RUNX2, OSX, RANKL and increases in OPG. In addition, SMG-MSCs showed fewer ALP positive cells and reduced ALP activity, which was more comparable to the non-induced MSCs (control). SMG-MSCs also showed little or no collagen production or matrix mineralization after 12 days of culture in osteogenic media. The data show that SMG-MSC (M) are drastically hampered from osteogenesis after 12 days of culturing in osteogenic media and instead resemble non-induced MSC cultures. These results confirm that lack of gravity or mechanical stress severely affects MSC osteogenic differentiation. Meyers et al. have reported similar results with ALP and RUNX2 expression and collagen content under SMG [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The same study reported inactivation of the MAPK-ERK pathway due to reduced expression of collagen 1 in extracellular matrix leading to inhibition of RUNX2 expression and osteogenesis [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, Sheyn et al. have shown that SMG down-regulates genes regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, cytoskeletal proteins, and cell communication and upregulates stress-related genes in human MSCs [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>LIPUS exposure increased expression of ALP, OSX, RUNX2, and RANKL and decreased OPG gene expression in SMG cultures. LIPUS restored OPG gene expression to levels similar to normal in gravity grown control samples. RANKL and OPG are proteins secreted by osteoblasts and MSCs to control osteoclastogenesis. As MSCs differentiate into osteoblasts, the level of RANKL increases while that of OPG decreases. LIPUS exposure increased the RANKL/OPG ratio in normal and SMG cultures, thus enhancing osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Similarly, recent studies by Liu et al. have shown that static and dynamic pressure can increase the RANKL/OPG ratio in early osteogenesis [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These findings correlate well with our study, as LIPUS is an acoustic pressure wave providing localized and targeted stimulation. On the contrary, Rubin et al. has reported that cyclic strain reduces RANKL expression in murine marrow stem cells [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is speculated that different mechanical stimuli can induce different responses in MSCs. Detailed study of mechanical stimuli relative to corresponding mechanotransductive pathways is required to understand MSC role in osteoclastogenesis and osteogenesis. The osteoblast RUNX, OSX and RANKL expression data confirmed inhibitory effects of SMG on osteogenic gene expression. LIPUS exposure restored RUNX2 and OSX expression in osteoblast but further reduced expression of RANKL, RUNX2 and OSX are established osteogenic markers. Increased levels of RUNX2 and OSX indicate anabolic effects due to LIPUS treatment. Conversely, RANKL is known to induce osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, thus the reduced RANKL expression seen in LIPUS treated groups (MU &amp; GU) is indicative of the anti-resorptive effects of LIPUS stimulation in osteoblast cultures. Gene expression analysis, along with recently published data from our lab showing enhanced mineralization in osteoblast, shows LIPUS potential as an anabolic and anti-resorptive stimulus for osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Together, gene expression data from MSC and osteoblast show inhibitory effects of SMG on osteogenesis and possible increase in osteoclastogenesis. LIPUS stimulation in SMG conditions significantly increases the expression of RUNX2, ALP, and OSX while reducing RANKL expression, indicating increased osteogenesis but reduced osteoclastogenesis.</p>
              <p>ALP positive population and activity increased with exposure to LIPUS stimulation. SMG cultures had little or no ALP positive cells; application of LIPUS restored ALP positive cells. ALP is a membrane bound enzyme that functions to catalyze phosphate addition to calcium ions resulting in the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals and matrix mineralization. Since ALP expression is known as an early osteogenic marker, increases in ALP positive cell numbers and ALP activity is indicative of MSC osteogenic differentiation, as seen in the LIPUS treated cultures.</p>
              <p>Collagen and matrix mineralization also increased with the application of LIPUS. Collagen is an extracellular matrix protein that facilitates cellular adhesion, mineralization, and mechanotransduction through integrin α2β1 [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The reduction of collagen content inhibits integrin α2β1 activation, formation of focal adhesion complexes and MAP-ERK pathways, which are essential from osteogenic induction. LIPUS exposure restores collagen in ECM resulting in increased cellular adhesion, matrix mineralization and activation of MAPK-ERK pathway.</p>
              <p>The lack of mechanical stimulus can severely impair the ability of MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts. Studies have shown down-regulation of the focal adhesion complex, MAPK and TGF-β signaling pathways in MSCs under SMG. LIPUS is known to induce acoustic streaming in interstitial fluid and localized mechanical vibrations in the ECM [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] resulting in the local deformation of cell membranes and shear stresses and strains to osteoblasts [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These mechanical deformations subsequently activate integrin, mechanosensitive-calcium channels, G-proteins, IGF, TGF-β/BMP and gap junctions, activating different downstream pathways [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Mechanical stimulations are known to activate different signaling pathways including MAPK, beta-catenin and Akt and FAK pathway. Studies by Olkku et al. have shown ultrasound induce beta-catenin activation in osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore LIPUS stimulation has been shown to activate Integrin/FAK/PI3K/Akt complex and MAPK-Erk pathways leading to enhances osteoblastic activity in osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These studies indicate that the LIPUS treatment can activate mechanotransductive pathways and significantly increase osteogenic differentiation in stem cells. The results from this study suggest that LIPUS stimulation enhance ALP activity and collagen content to facilitate matrix mineralization. Detail mechanistic studies are required to fully understand the effects of ultrasound on MSC proliferation and differentiations.</p>
              <p>In summary, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of LIPUS on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in disuse conditions. Application of LIPUS increased the expression of osteogenic genes along with increasing ALP activity and expression. LIPUS treated SMG cultures had higher collagen content in ECM and more matrix calcification. Further studies are needed to understand underlying mechanotransductive pathways and the effect of LIPUS on early osteoclastogenesis/osteogenesis in MSCs. Taken together, we conclude that LIPUS provides the essential mechanical stimulus to induce osteogenesis in a SMG environment and has the potential to be used as therapy for disuse osteoporosis due to space travel, long-term bed rest, and brain/spinal cord injuries.</p>
