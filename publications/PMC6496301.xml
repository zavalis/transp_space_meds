                  <title>Objectives</title>
                  <p>Exposure to microgravity induces many adaptive and pathological changes in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). However, the underlying mechanisms of these changes are poorly understood. We revealed the gene expression patterns of hBMSCs under normal ground (NG) and simulated microgravity (SMG), which showed an interpretation for these changes by gene regulation and signal pathways analysis.</p>

                  <p>In this study, hBMSCs were osteogenically induced for 0, 2, 7 and 14 days under normal ground gravity and simulated microgravity, followed by analysis of the differences in transcriptome expression during osteogenic differentiation by RNA sequencing and some experimental verification for these results.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>The results indicated that 837, 399 and 894 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 2, 7 and 14 days samples, respectively, out of which 13 genes were selected for qRT‐PCR analysis to confirm the RNA‐sequencing results. After analysis, we found that proliferation was inhibited in the early stage of induction. In the middle stage, osteogenic differentiation was inhibited, whereas adipogenic differentiation benefited from SMG. Moreover, SMG resulted in the up‐regulation of genes specific for tumorigenesis in the later stage.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p>Our data revealed that SMG inhibits the proliferation and inhibits the differentiation towards osteoblasts but promotes adipogenesis. SMG also selects highly tumorigenic cells for survival under prolonged SMG.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that microgravity induces significant bone loss in weight‐bearing bones at a rate of approximately 1%‐2% per month.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Bone loss under microgravity may be due to the inhibition of osteoblast development and the increase in osteoclastic activity.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Exposure to microgravity for a few days has shown a marked suppression of differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) into osteoblasts detected by a decrease in <italic>ALPL</italic>,<italic> COL1A1</italic>,<italic> SPARC</italic> and <italic>RunX2</italic>.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> Under microgravity, osteoblasts show shorter and wavier microtubules, smaller and fewer focal adhesions, and thinner cortical actin and stress fibres. Simultaneously, microgravity causes an increase in bone resorption by osteoclasts and a decrease in osteoblast cellular integrity.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Microgravity also has a significant effect on cell proliferation. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells cultured under the SMG condition had a significantly reduced total cell number compared to cells cultured under normal ground gravity (NG).<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Another study found that the proliferation of murine bone marrow stromal cells was also inhibited in space flight.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> It has been reported that cells under SMG are more flattened and reached confluence at a lower cell density.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>
</p>
              <p>Random positioning machine (RPM) is a kind of 3D clinostat that provides continuous random changes in orientation relative to the gravity vector, which can be used to simulate microgravity.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> In this study, we used an RPM to simulate microgravity and evaluated the effects of SMG on whole gene expression during osteogenesis of hBMSCs. We performed an RNA‐seq analysis of hBMSCs induced osteogenically under SMG and NG, and clustered differentially expressed genes (DEGs) into several functional groups to analyse the impacts of SMG on the physiology of hBMSCs.</p>

                <p>The SM‐31 random position machine (RPM) (Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing, China) was used to simulate microgravity condition. It was operated in random modes of speed (0.1‐10 rpm) inside a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C and 100% humidity). After the cells of 3rd passage reached 60%‐70% confluency, the medium was replaced with osteogenic medium<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> (L‐Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 μg/mL <sc>l</sc>‐ascorbic acid (Sigma, Shanghai, China), 10 mmol/L β‐glycerophosphate (Sigma), 0.1 μmol/L dexamethasone (Sigma), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The flasks were fixed on a cell culture vessel for RPM exposure. Cells grown in NG condition were also filled with osteogenic medium and were statically placed in the same CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The medium was changed every other day. Cells induced for 0, 2, 7 and 14 days were used to study the effects of SMG. The subsequent results follow these time‐points unless otherwise specified.</p>

                <p>RNA from cells was extracted using Trizol reagent (Sigma). All RNA samples were detected and analysed in Vazyme Biotech Co. (Nanjing, China). RNA integrity and concentration were detected by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA libraries were constructed with rRNA elimination and sequenced by the Illumina Hiseq X Ten platform as 150‐bp pair‐ended reads. Reads were aligned using Hisat2 (v2.0.5, Center for Computational Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA). FPKM estimation was performed with Cuffdiff (v1.3.0, Cole Trapnell’s lab at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA), aligned reads were counted with HTSeq and differential expression analysis was performed with Cuffdiff (v2.2.1). Differentially expressed genes were selected using a cut‐off at a P value of less than 0.05 (FDR adjusted for multiple testing) and the absolute value of log2 (fold change) greater than or equal to 1.

                <p>Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA was performed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Shanghai, China). Primers (Table <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) were designed using Primer Premier 6.0 Demo (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and Oligo 7.36 Demo software (Molecular Biology Insights, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO, USA). Quantitative real‐time PCR reactions using the LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green qPCR Supermix (Roche, Shanghai, China) were performed in the CFX96 Touch Deep Well Real‐Time PCR Detection System (Bio‐Rad, Berkeley, CA) with 18S rRNA as an internal control. The thermal cycler protocol included denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 second, 56°C for 30 second and 72°C for 20 second. Quantification of selected gene expression was performed using the relative quantitation (2<sup>−ΔΔCT</sup>) method. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and three independent experiments were performed.</p>

                <p>Paired‐end RNA‐Seq reads of 150 bp were generated by using the VAHTS mRNA‐seq v2 Library Prep Kit. Mapping the sequence reads onto the human genome revealed that a total of 356 143 952 raw reads were generated from all the cDNA libraries. After removing adapters, low‐quality regions, and possible contamination, 353 406 202 clean reads with an average GC of 51.98% were obtained. The proportion of clean reads in the human transcriptome libraries that mapped to the human reference genome ranged from 89.90% to 91.14%, while the adapter proportion ranged from 0.48% to 0.97%. The proportion of reads with a Phred quality value Q &gt; 30 among the clean reads ranged from 90.64% to 91.01%. Mapping of exons, introns and intergenic regions to the human reference genome accounted for an average of 91.09%, 6.87% and 2.04%, respectively.

                <p>K‐means clustering of all DEGs using the Euclidean distance method was performed. Hierarchical clustering of 5411 DEGs (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C) exhibited similar expression patterns in the principal component analysis. The expression profiles of d0 were different from the other profiles; NG2 and SMG2, NG7 and SMG7, NG14 and SMG14 clustered together. Similarity between groups of day 2 and day 7 was more compared to those of day 14. In comparison with NG and SMG, we found that most genes in cells under SMG2 and SMG7 had a down‐regulated expression pattern (more blue bands) compared with those in cells under NG2 and NG7, respectively. In NG14 vs SMG14, there was no obvious change in the number of up‐ and down‐regulated genes. However, the genes up‐ or down‐regulated were different between cells under NG14 and SMG14. Eight main clusters were plotted with expression patterns of genes (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). We selected the DEGs in each cluster and classified them based on UniProtKB keywords (Table <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). The first four clusters were in the NG group and the last four clusters were in the SMG group. Cluster 1 represents genes whose expression level decreased from day 0 to day 2 and then increased from day 7 to day 14. DEGs included in cluster 1 were mainly enriched in disulphide bond and signal. Cluster 2 represents genes that underwent an overall trend of decrease, and DEGs were mainly enriched in developmental protein and glycoprotein. Cluster 3 shows genes up‐regulated from day 0 to day 2 and down‐regulated from day 7 to day 14, in contrast to cluster 1. No DEG was included in cluster 3. Clusters 4 represents genes that underwent an overall trend of increase, and DEGs were mainly enriched in glycoprotein and signal. Cluster 5 shows the same trend as cluster 4, and DEGs were mainly enriched in transmembrane helix and membrane. Cluster 6 represents genes up‐regulated at day 7 and down‐regulated at day 14, and no DEG was included in this cluster. Cluster 7 shows genes with decreased expression at day 2 and no significant change at day 7 and day 14. DEGs were mainly enriched in signal and serine protease inhibitor. Cluster 8 represents genes up‐regulated on day 2 and down‐regulated on days 7 and 14, and DEGs were mainly enriched in metal‐binding and microsome.</p>

                <p>The second day (day 2) post‐induction was chosen to analyse the gene ontology (GO) of differentially expressed genes in the early stage of osteogenesis. To facilitate the analysis, 10 of the most enriched GO terms of three ontologies (biological process, cellular component and molecular function) were selected. As shown in Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, GO analysis indicated that most of the enriched DEGs were related to cell cycle and cell division in three ontologies. Upon analysis of the top enriched GO terms for the three ontologies, it was found that in almost all the terms, down‐regulated genes make up the majority (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). In the cell cycle, 89.93% of the genes were down‐regulated, while in the chromosome in cellular component and binding in molecular function, 82.65% and 60.50% of the genes were down‐regulated, respectively. Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes enrichment (KEGG) analysis showed that these genes were involved in various metabolic pathways when cells were induced for two days (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C). Almost one tenth of DEGs were enriched in cell cycle (8.88%), and cell cycle was the most significantly enriched pathway. Among the 19 genes enriched for cell cycle, 18 genes were down‐regulated with <italic>MCM5</italic> (−2.48‐fold), <italic>CCNA2</italic> (−2.46‐fold), <italic>CCNB1</italic> (−3.61‐fold), <italic>CDK1</italic> (−5.03‐fold), <italic>E2F1</italic> (−3.07‐fold), <italic>CDC25B</italic> (−2.01‐fold) and CDC25C (−16.22‐fold) being the most prominent. Moreover, we also found that there were two GO terms related to tubulin and cytoskeleton in molecular function (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B).</p>

                <p>To verify this result, cell proliferation, cell cycle assays and immunofluorescence of actin cytoskeleton were performed to determine the effect of microgravity. The proliferation of cells was detected at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hour of osteogenic induction. Growth curve analysis of cells revealed their capacity to proliferate under both NG and SMG, albeit with different proliferation rates (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). The proliferation rate of cells was higher under NG compared to SMG. The cell cycle assay showed that most of cells at 0 hour were in G0/G1 phase, and few in S and G2/M phase (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B). When cells in the SMG group were induced for 12 hour, there was no change in the proportion of cells in S phase, but the number of cells in G0/G1 phase decreased while the number of cells in G2/M phase increased in comparison with the NG group. After induction for 24 hour under SMG, the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phase increased significantly in the SMG group over the NG group. Although, the percentage of S and G2/M phase reduced at 48 hour irrespective of the group, the S and G2/M phase in SMG group still accounted for a larger proportion significantly. In addition, fluorescence images of actin cytoskeleton of cells induced for 48 hour under SMG and NG conditions showed that the arrangement of cytoskeleton lost regularity under SMG and the length became shorter than that under NG condition (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>).</p>

                <p>To study the middle and later stages of osteogenesis, days 7 and 14 were chosen to perform GO and KEGG analysis. In SMG7, 10 of the most enriched GO terms of three ontologies were selected (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A and Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). GO analysis indicated that most of the enriched DEGs were related to multicellular organismal process. The pathway results showed that PPAR signing pathway and calcium signalling pathway were the most enriched pathways (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). In the PPAR signalling pathway, two‐third of the genes were up‐regulated (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C); some amongst them, such as <italic>PPARγ</italic> (2.21‐fold), <italic>FABP3</italic> (4.03‐fold), <italic>FABP4</italic> (2.22‐fold), <italic>PLIN1</italic> (2.28‐fold) and <italic>SCD</italic> (2.06‐fold) were important for adipose differentiation. In the calcium signalling pathway, 80% of the DEGs were down‐regulated (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). In NG14 vs SMG14 group, multicellular organismal process, receptor binding and extracellular region were the three most enriched GO terms of the three ontologies studied (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A and Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Analysis of the top 20 statistics of pathway enrichment (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B) revealed that 31.94% of the genes were enriched in cancer, cytokine‐cytokine receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways; the cytokine‐cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant enrichment pathway. It was observed that the genes enriched in these pathways were associated with immune response, tumour progression, proliferation, differentiation and signal transduction.</p>

                <p>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Oil Red O staining assays were performed to detect osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs induced with osteogenic induction medium under SMG. Oil Red O staining assay showed that on days 7 and 14 the hBMSCs under SMG tended to differentiate into adipocytes, especially at 14 days, while there was no significant change under NG condition (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>A). Furthermore, with ALP assay, no significant difference was found between the NG and SMG groups on days 2, but a significant difference in the activity of ALP was detected on days 7 and 14. However, there was no significant change in ALP activity at the three time‐points within the SMG group (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>B). Cell proliferation assays on days 7 and 14 were also performed to study the effect of prolonged SMG. Interestingly, enhanced proliferation of cells in SMG14 group was found (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>C). However, there was no significant difference in SMG7 and NG7.</p>

                <p>Quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR) was performed to validate the differentially expressed genes involved in the RNA‐seq data (Figure <xref rid="cpr12539-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref>). Thirteen genes were selected from the differentially expressed genes of different time periods.

In 2 days, genes related to the cell cycle (<italic>CDKN3</italic>,<italic> MCM5</italic>,<italic> CCNB1</italic>,<italic> CDK1</italic> and <italic>CDC20</italic>) were significantly down‐regulated, while the genes specific for osteogenic differentiation, <italic>RunX2</italic>,<italic> ALPL, BMP2</italic> and <italic>COL1A1</italic> were down‐regulated.

In 7 days, although the genes specific for cell cycle were up‐regulated, no significant difference between NG and SMG groups were observed. The genes specific for osteogenic differentiation were significantly down‐regulated, and all the genes specific for adipogenic differentiation were significantly up‐regulated. In 14 days, we found the same trend as 7 days in the genes specific for differentiation, but the cell cycle‐related genes <italic>MCM5</italic>,<italic> CCNB1</italic> and <italic>CDC20</italic> were significant up‐regulated.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In the present study, whole transcriptome analysis revealed that SMG affected many biological processes of hBMSCs. Not only tissue‐specific genes but also genes related to proliferation and differentiation were affected. On day 2, hBMSCs cultured under SMG exhibited down‐regulation of the genes related to cell cycle, such as <italic>MCM5</italic>, CCNA2, <italic>CCNB1</italic>,<italic> CDK1</italic>,<italic> E2F1</italic>,<italic> CDC25B</italic> and <italic>CDC25C</italic>.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> It has been reported that microgravity changes the distribution of the cell cycle phase in many mammalian cells, such as primitive human haematopoietic progenitor cells<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> and endothelial cells.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> In addition, several studies have shown that microgravity has a major effect on the cytoskeleton,<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and cha<underline underline-style="single">n</underline>ges in cytoskeleton may play an important role in the cell cycle. Alterations in cytoskeletal structure can block cell growth in G2/M (inhibition of microtubule polymerization during G2/M phase).<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> In our experiments, we observed that the cytoskeleton of the cells induced for 48 hour under SMG was disordered and the length of the cytoskeleton was shorter than that under NG condition. The decrease in the above genes and the change of the cytoskeleton resulted in the arrest of the cell cycle in S phase and G2/M transitions, and the interaction of these changes led to an increase in the proportion of cells in S and G2/M phases. These results were different from the previous report<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> showing that the cell cycle was arrested in G0/G1 phase. However, our results were consistent with another study showing that modelled μ‐g induced alterations in cell cycle kinetics characterized by prolonged S phase and reduced cyclin A expression.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> The previous study showed that continuous inhibition of genes cyclin A and <italic>CDC2</italic> inhibits the cell exit from S phase.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> In our results, genes of <italic>CCNA2</italic> (cyclin A, −2.46‐fold) and <italic>CDK1</italic> (<italic>CDC2</italic>, −5.03‐fold) were significantly down‐regulated, which maybe contributed to the arrest of hBMSCs in S phase. Damm et  al<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> also reported that culturing cells on the RPM for 6 and 12 hour resulted in their depletion from the G0/G1 phases, concomitant with their accumulation in the G2/M phase. In our RNA‐seq results, some check point genes, such as <italic>CCNB1</italic> (−3.61‐fold) which plays a role in the regulation of G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle,<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>
<italic>CDC25B</italic> (−2.01‐fold) that is a dual specificity phosphatase which accumulates during the late S and early G2 phases of the cell cycle and is essential for the G2/M transition<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> and <italic>CDC25C</italic> which plays a key role in G2/M phase transition,<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> were significantly down‐regulated. The down‐regulation of these check point genes may also be contributed to the arrest of hBMSCs in G2/M phase. In addition, the proliferation inhibition of hBMSCs may be resulted from various factors, such as the osteogenic differentiation, SMG or their combination. In this study, however, it is inferred that the lower proliferation rate of hBMSCs under SMG in comparison with that under normal gravity should be resulted from SMG because these experiments were performed under the same osteogenic induction condition. The results of cell cycle analysis indicated that hBMSCs were mainly arrested in the S and G2/M phases under SMG, and our proliferation experiment showed that SMG decreased the proliferation potential of cells in the early stage of osteogenic induction.</p>
              <p>Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the differentiation of hBMSCs was mainly affected by SMG in the middle stage of induction (day 7). Many studies have reported that microgravity inhibited osteogenic differentiation and enhanced adipogenic differentiation.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> In agreement with these reports, KEGG pathway enrichment in our study showed that the PPAR signalling pathway and calcium signalling pathway were the most enriched pathways with two‐thirds of the DEGs in PPAR signalling pathway being up‐regulated, while 80% of the DEGs in calcium signalling pathway being down‐regulated. From previous reports, we know that PPAR‐γ, a well‐known adipogenic marker, powerfully induces adipogenesis at the morphological and molecular levels in response to a number of PPAR‐γ activators.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>
<italic>CEBPA</italic> (2.52‐fold) has also been showed to have roles in differentiation and lipogenesis.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>
<italic>PPAR‐γ</italic> is essential for the differentiation of adipocytes in vivo and in vitro, and <italic>CEBPA</italic> has been shown to induce adipocyte differentiation through transactivation of <italic>PPAR‐γ</italic>.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Up‐regulation of these genes promotes adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs under SMG. Calcium signalling pathway plays an important role in osteogenic differentiation.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> The expression of osteogenic genes in hBMSCs was highly increased with high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the in vitro environment,<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the transient receptor potential melastatin type 7 (TRPM7) further triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the inositol trisphosphate receptor type 2 on the endoplasmic reticulum and promoted osteogenesis.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> In addition to inhibiting the osteogenesis‐specific genes, inhibition of calcium signalling pathway is also responsible for SMG inhibition of osteogenic differentiation. In the later stages of induction (day 14), GO enrichment analysis showed that SMG mainly affected the multicellular organism process and developmental process. Through pathway enrichment, we found that cytokine‐cytokine receptor interaction and pathways in cancer were the most enriched pathways. From these DEGs, we found that many genes associated with growth factors, cytokines, tumorigenesis and angiogenesis were up‐regulated, while the genes associated with apoptosis, inflammation and signal transduction were down‐regulated. Previous reports have suggested that prolonged spaceflight has a negative impact on the immune system resulting in hypoplasia of lymphoid organs and alterations in mitogen‐induced blastogenesis.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Under SMG, a significant loss of antigen‐specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was observed, suggesting the negative effect of SMG on cell‐mediated immunity.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> Moreover, microgravity has adverse effects on tumour cells. Although cancer stem cells are committed to selective differentiation when cultured in microgravity, a study has provided evidence of significant apoptosis under this condition.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> Another study reported that some tumours seem to be much less aggressive in the microgravity environment of space compared to Earth.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref> Nevertheless, SMG may have altered the tumour cell characteristics and enhanced the invasive property. Therefore, it is possible that the microgravity analogue culture environment may have selected highly tumorigenic cells for survival.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> Our RNA‐seq results are more inclined to support this conclusion.</p>
              <p>To confirm the effect of simulated microgravity on osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation derived from RNA‐seq data, we performed assays of ALP activity and Oil Red O staining. ALP activity, as a marker of osteogenic differentiation, reflects bone formation and/or mineralization.<xref rid="cpr12539-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> We found that ALP activity at 7 and 14 days was significantly increased compared to that at 2 days in NG group, but no obvious change in SMG group. These results indicated that SMG inhibited osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. For analysis of adipogenic potential of hBMSCs under osteogenic induction, we found the significantly positive staining of Oil Red O in SMG group compared to those in NG group, especially at 14 days, which shows a tendency of adipogenic differentiation even under osteogenic induction. These results are consistent with the conclusion of RNA‐seq data.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, SMG inhibits the proliferation of cells in the early stage of osteogenesis of hBMSCs while in the middle stage, it inhibits the differentiation towards osteoblasts and promotes adipogenesis. It may select highly tumorigenic cells for survival under prolonged SMG. We believe that the data provided in this study may clarify some of the physiological changes, such as bone loss and immune system dysfunction occurring during spaceflight, and in favour of a better understanding of the mechanism of these changes.</p>
