                  <p id="Par3"><italic>D. radiodurans</italic> cells exposed to low Earth orbit conditions do not exhibit any morphological damage. However, an accumulation of numerous outer-membrane-associated vesicles was observed. On levels of proteins and transcripts, a multi-faceted response was detected to alleviate cell stress. The UvrABC endonuclease excision repair mechanism was triggered to cope with DNA damage. Defense against reactive oxygen species is mirrored by the increased abundance of catalases and is accompanied by the increased abundance of putrescine, which works as reactive oxygen species scavenging molecule. In addition, several proteins and mRNAs, responsible for regulatory and transporting functions showed increased abundances. The decrease in primary metabolites indicates alternations in the energy status, which is needed to repair damaged molecules.</p>

                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Low Earth orbit induced molecular rearrangements trigger multiple components of metabolic stress response and regulatory networks in exposed microbial cells. Presented results show that the non-sporulating bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> survived long-term low Earth orbit exposure if wavelength below 200 nm are not present, which mirrors the UV spectrum of Mars, where CO<sub>2</sub> effectively provides a shield below 190 nm. These results should be considered in the context of planetary protection concerns and the development of new sterilization techniques for future space missions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par5">As humans continue to conquer the realms of the solar system, understanding the molecular mechanisms of survival in outer space becomes increasingly important. Outer space is a hostile environment, which constrains any form of life. Remarkably, a few extremophilic microbial species have been shown to withstand the drastic influence of the outer space factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Exposed to the outer space environment, microorganisms are challenged by several hostile parameters: galactic cosmic and solar UV radiation, extreme vacuum, temperature fluctuations, desiccation, freezing, and microgravity. The International Space Station (ISS) provides a suitable environment for astrobiological experiments in the low Earth orbit (LEO). Limited previous studies partially described microbial responses after exposure outside the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Significantly impacting the development of astrobiology, the EXPOSE experiments (2008–2015) concluded that not only spore-forming bacteria such as <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> can survive an interplanetary travel, but also seeds, lichens (e.g., <italic>Stichococcus sp</italic>, <italic>Trichoderma sp</italic> and <italic>Acarospora sp</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and non-spore forming thermophilic bacteria such as <italic>Deinococcus geothermalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, we have still been missing an explicit knowledge of molecular mechanisms permitting survival and adaptation in the outer space environment. Space parameters affect microorganisms by altering a variety of physiological features, including proliferation rate, cell metabolism, cell division, cell motility, virulence, drug resistance, and biofilm production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These aforementioned physiological perturbations of space-exposed microorganisms are very poorly understood on the molecular level. In order to achieve a detailed understanding of the full-functional molecular set up of microorganisms exposed to outer space, a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of their molecular responses is desirable.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The gram-positive bacterium <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> possesses numerous remarkable properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which made it a suitable candidate for long-term space exposure experiments within the scope of the Tanpopo orbital project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Preliminary experiments with monochromatic lamps at UV<sub>172 nm</sub> UV<sub>254 nm,</sub> indicated that cells of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> should be able to withstand solar UV radiation on the ISS for 1 year as multi-layers of more than 200 μm thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Additionally, several initial investigations prior to the Tanpopo space mission already resolved molecular responses of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> to selected simulated parameters of the outer space environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Exposure to extreme conditions such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation and desiccation cause an increase of reactive oxygen species, which severely damage nucleic acids, by forming bipyrimidine dimers or introducing DNA double strand breaks. It is noteworthy that the number of nucleic acid fragmentations of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> when exposed to the same amount of radiation do not differentiate. However, with a dose of ionizing radiation that is already lethal to <italic>E. coli</italic>, when exposed to it for 3-4 hours, an efficient protection and repair mechanism in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> allows the nucleic acid fragments in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> to be reassembled into complete chromosomes and the cells return to normal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although the nucleic acid repair mechanisms show no remarkable functional difference in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> is 50 times more resistant to ionizing radiation and 33 times more resistant to UVC radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The mechanisms which allow <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> to survive under such conditions are not completely unraveled yet. However, research data suggests that the extent of protein damage caused by irradiation is related to the cells survival potential, which suggests that <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> most likely focuses on protecting proteins from oxidative damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Possible explanations for an increased protein protection are an increased ROS-scavenging and ROS-detoxifying activity via orthophosphate-manganese-small molecule complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and a higher intracellular manganese to iron ratio than in radiation sensitive-microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Though, these physiological and metabolic adaptions are unique for <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>, it is hard to explain genome reconstitution without considering DNA repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Generally, in prokaryotes, there are several DNA repair systems, such as photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, double strand break repair, homology directed repair and ultraviolet damage endonuclease repair, each specialized to a certain type of damage. Nucleotide excision repair stands out from the other repair mechanisms, since it is able to recognize a broad range of structurally unrelated DNA damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It consists of four crucial proteins, UvrA, UvrB, UvrC and UvrD, which in conjunction with each other orchestrate effective DNA repair performance. The Uvr cluster proteins are triggered by the exposure of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> to several space-related conditions (UVC and vacuum), albeit the response to these factors is a multi-layered process, in which many other molecular components, in addition to DNA damage repair, are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">In this study, dehydrated cells of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> were exposed to LEO conditions for 1 year outside the ISS in frames of the Tanpopo space mission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. After exposure and subsequent recovery in complex medium, metabolites, proteins and mRNAs were extracted from space-exposed cells, analyzed with integrative –omics techniques and compared to ground controls. The results show the early molecular response of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> after LEO exposure, help to understand which molecular tools are used to cope with the damage induced by outer space conditions and highlight the power of combining different –omics techniques to unravel molecular stress response mechanisms.</p>

As survival of space-returned cells was confirmed successfully, a recovery time of 2 h was chosen to see the early response after exposure to harsh LEO conditions. The recovery time was chosen based on none-exposed, dried cells that already showed growth between three and six hours of recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

The surface of dehydrated <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> cells showed no detectable damage and preserved its integrity after LEO exposure. However, SEM observations revealed the accumulation of multiple nano-sized particles over the surface of LEO-returned cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c–f; Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). These spherical-like morphologies were not visible on the surface of ground control cells and could be attributed to the results of direct influence of LEO parameters on biological material, e.g., Maillard reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p>

The Maxquant data processing resulted in 1828 protein hits for the intracellular compartment (Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) throughout all replicates (59 % of the whole <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> proteome).

                <p id="Par12">Welch’s <italic>t</italic> tests were performed to identify proteins with a higher abundance in the control and the space-exposed cells. These resulted in 226 proteins (19.3 %) that were identified in all replicates and differentially expressed (<italic>p</italic> value below 0.05) between the conditions, with 153 being more abundant after LEO exposure and 73 more abundant in the control cells (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>B). To cluster these proteins in molecular function categories, the online tool of the Gene Ontology Consortium, Panther (V 13.1), was used (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Seventy-nine hits were found for proteins, which were more abundant after LEO exposure, whereas 48 hits were found for the proteins which were less abundant. The relative distribution between the categories differed between the two groups. Proteins with catalytic activity and transporter activity were more abundant after exposure, while proteins with binding abilities became less abundant (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Taking a closer look into the categories revealed for transporters and binding, which were more abundant after exposure, proteins such as the two histidine kinases DR_B0029 (<italic>p</italic> value 0.046) and DR_1174 (<italic>p</italic> value 0.047) and the ABC transporter DR_0096 (<italic>p</italic> value 0.031). On the other hand, less abundant proteins do not include any histidine kinases. Furthermore, data obtained after exposure indicated higher abundances of proteins, such as histidine kinases and ABC transporters and S-layer associated proteins, involved in transporter and regulatory activities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, many proteins involved in the biosynthetic pathway from glutamine to putrescine appear more abundant after exposure to LEO conditions.

              <p id="Par20">Results presented in this study may increase awareness regarding planetary protection concerns on, for instance, the Martian atmosphere which absorbs UV radiation below 190–200 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. To mimic this condition, our experimental setup on the ISS included a SiO<sub>2</sub> glass window, which blocks out UV light &lt; 190 nm. The term planetary protection refers to protecting celestial bodies from contamination by terrestrial life and protecting Earth from contamination from other celestial bodies which may return with samples taken from other Solar System bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

                <p id="Par21">The overall amount of free amino acids, organic acids (TCA cycle intermediates), and sugars decreased in LEO exposed cells. Although limited under space-simulated conditions, previous studies have shown a similar tendency after exposure of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> to UVC radiation combined with vacuum and solely vacuum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Our untargeted metabolomics approach indicated a reduced level of sugars during repair after LEO exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). Sugars can be used as a carbon and energy source, which in turn can be utilized by various repair mechanisms, for instance the repair of damaged nucleic acids.</p>
                <p id="Par22"><italic>D. radiodurans</italic> are organotrophic bacteria which possess proteolytic properties for protein degradation and amino acid catabolism. In 2010, Daly et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] demonstrated an induction of their proteolytic activity following ionizing radiation. Our proteomics dataset after LEO exposure supports this assumption. Based on proteins identified in all replicates, nine proteases were found at higher abundances after LEO exposure, two of them significantly increased (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>E). Amino acids are used as nitrogen and carbon source, which can be further utilized for many metabolic processes, e.g., growth and nucleic acid repair. As <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> is not able to utilize ammonia as a nitrogen source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], it completely relies on exogenous amino acids, and this elevated pull of proteases presumably aims to degrade damaged proteins in order to deliver more amino acids during recovery from LEO exposure. The relative amount of amino acids (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) differs most between ground control and space exposed cells for glutamine and glutamic acid, as more of these amino acids are needed for nucleic acid repair mechanisms after space exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Glutamine and glutamate certainly play an important role in growth, but in case of alleviation from stress, which cells received from LEO exposure, results indicate that they might be utilized as intermediates for repair processes. Similar results were observed after exposure to simulated LEO conditions (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Simulated LEO conditions likewise reduced the abundance of most amino acids and organic acids throughout the early repair stage, with glutamine and glutamate showing a strong response (Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p>

                <title>How to cope with space induced DNA damage?</title>
                <p id="Par23"><italic>D. radiodurans</italic> does not possess any special mechanisms that prevents it from nucleic acid damage, such as double-strand breaks after ionizing gamma irradiation and the amount of radiation-induced double-strand breaks is fairly similar between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Preliminary studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] showed that dehydrated <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> cells are damaged by vacuum and temperature cycles in the LEO. However, UV radiation (100 to 280 nm) is most problematic for survival of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> cells. On Earth, harmful solar UVC radiation is not dangerous to biota, because of an oxygen and ozone shield in the Earth’s atmosphere. LEO, however, does not provide such defense possibilities. Therefore, dried cells outside the ISS were protected from most deleterious UVC radiation below 200 nm by a SiO<sub>2</sub> glass window. Apart from breaks in the DNA, UV radiation can cause bipyrimidine photoproducts, which later lead to mutations as they interfere with DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Usually, UV induced lesions can be repaired by photoreactivation, which uses energy from visible light to enzymatically remove pyrimidine dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, as the necessary enzyme is not present in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], damages, caused by solar UV radiation on dehydrated <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> cells are repaired by nucleotide excision repair. Truglio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] already recognized the flexibility of the UvrABC excision repair mechanisms in prokaryotes, which is very well suited to repair damage caused by UV radiation. Our proteomics data (Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>) shows that all key proteins involved in the UvrABC mechanism, which are responsible for detecting lesions and cutting DNA are more abundant after exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Apparently, there are two UvrA proteins in <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>, which transport UvrB to the damaged DNA. Usually, the intracellular concentration of UvrB is much higher than UvrA, as one UvrA dimer can transport multiple UvrB proteins onto different damage sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The second UvrA protein might accelerate transport as it increases the specificity to identify target regions. Apart from both UvrA proteins (both <italic>p</italic> value 0.0065), also UvrB (<italic>p</italic> value 0.0100) and UvrC (<italic>p</italic> value 0.0141), which are responsible to cut out a 12 or 13-mer with the DNA lesion, were more abundant after space exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Finally, the transcription repair coupling factor Mfd (<italic>p</italic> value 0.0075) showed an increase in abundance after LEO exposure. In bacteria, Mfd scans DNA to find RNA polymerases which are blocked by strand lesions. Upon detection, it mediates the release of the stalled RNA polymerase and recruits the nucleotide excision repair machinery to the damaged site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Furthermore, both simulated LEO exposure and real LEO exposure showed an increased abundance of proteins involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>; S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Many organisms require efficient pyrimidine biosynthesis for rapid cell proliferation and adaption to cell stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. We propose a role of pyrimidine biosynthesis in general stress response of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic>; however, unravelling the exact mechanisms require further experiments on mutants under pyrimidine depleting conditions during stress exposure.</p>

                <title>The molecular stress reactions after low Earth orbit exposure</title>
                <p id="Par24">Exposure to extreme environmental conditions, as those present in LEO, is very deleterious to nucleic acids. If the UvrABC mechanism proteins are still intact, space induced DNA damage can be repaired while the recovered cells seem to be still in a metabolically inactive state. Transcriptomic and proteomic measurements revealed an increase of transporter proteins after space exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). These transporters might be used for external nutrients (e.g., amino acids, sugars, and metal cofactors), which are necessary for repair processes. At the same time, EM-based observations of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> recovering after LEO exposure revealed intensive vesicle trafficking associated with the outer membranes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Based on our proteo-transcriptomic approach, such intensified membrane-associated trafficking may reflect higher levels of membrane-bound molecular machinery of LEO exposed <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Intensified vesiculation after recovery from LEO exposure can serve as a quick stress response, which augments cell survival by withdrawing stress products (e.g., damaged or misfolded proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Additionally, outer membrane vesicles may contain proteins important for nutrient acquisition, DNA transfer, transport of toxins and quorum sensing molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], eliciting the activation of resistance mechanisms after space exposure. In this regard, the exact role of intensified vesiculation in LEO exposed <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> is a topic that deserves more attention and thorough analysis in the future.</p>
                <p id="Par25">The ground control cells, which did not suffer exposure damage, showed an increase of transcripts, which code for replication proteins and transposases (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Control cells are already closer to the exponential phase than the space exposed cells. Proteomics data supports this assumption, as ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in folding of new proteins were more abundant in the control cells, to enable upcoming cell replication. Three ribosomal proteins (RlmN, RpmC and RtcB) were exclusively found in all three control replicates (Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par26">One cause of the extreme resistance of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> against radiation and oxidative damage is based on the high levels of constitutively expressed catalase and superoxide dismutase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. These enzymatic systems are devoted to the protection of cells against toxic reactive oxygen species. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes coding oxidative resistance proteins, such as the catalases <italic>katA</italic> (<italic>q</italic> value &lt; 0.002) and catalase <italic>DR_A0259</italic> (<italic>q</italic> value &lt; 0.002), are more abundant in LEO exposed cells (Table S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Previous proteomics studies showed an overrepresentation of proteins involved in the oxidative defense system after ionizing radiation was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Obviously, upon recovery from LEO exposure, <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> realized a potential oxidative threat and prioritized transcribing oxidation response proteins. The gene <italic>PdxT</italic> and its protein product “redox active pyridoxal 5′-phosphate synthase” are both overrepresented after LEO exposure in our proteo-transcriptomic analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). We previously reported the elevated expression of the pyridoxine biosynthesis proteins <italic>PdxT</italic> and <italic>PdxS</italic> in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>radiodurans</italic> in response to space-related stress stimulus (UVC and vacuum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The enzymes of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate biosynthesis are singlet oxygen resistance proteins involved in the synthesis of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, an efficient singlet oxygen quencher and a potential antioxidant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par27">Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of LEO exposed cells revealed a higher abundance of polyamines (e.g., putrescine), which potentially function as primordial forms of stress molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Additionally, according to proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, several genes/proteins connected to putrescine biosynthesis were more abundant after LEO exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). Furthermore, several proteins involved in this pathway were also identified as more abundant after simulated LEO conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par28">In summary, our data provides molecular evidence for a multi-faceted response of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> after LEO exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) by combining proteomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses with electron microscopy tools. We conclude that the increased abundance of proteins related to the cell envelope associated transport machinery along with intensive vesiculation may alleviate the stress response of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> during early recovery after LEO exposure. These molecular strategies can facilitate not only nutrient uptake, but also cellular waste removal, distribution of solute, and trafficking of potential signaling molecules. Additionally, our observations point to <italic>D. radiodurans’</italic> utilization of putrescine and ROS scavenging proteins (e.g., catalases) as important determinants in antioxidant defense mechanisms to cope with outer space-induced oxidative damage. Ultimately, the UvrABC endonuclease excision repair mechanism is likely to be recruited to repair nucleic acid damage. Conclusively, the results suggest that survival of <italic>D. radiodurans</italic> in LEO for a longer period is possible due to its efficient molecular response system. This indicates that even longer, farther journeys are possible for organisms with such capabilities.</p>

To reach the required thickness of cell layers, multiple 3 μL aliquots of cell suspension containing ~ 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL were added and air-dried.

Ultrathin sections (50–70 nm) were mounted on TEM support grids (Agar Scientific, copper, 200 mesh hex) coated with formvar film, stained with gadolinium triacetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] and lead citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], and finally examined in a Zeiss Libra 120. For scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM), samples were treated equally (washed, fixed, EtOH dehydrated) until TEM samples were transferred into dried acetone. Pellets for SEM examination were spread on filters (Whatman, 13 mm, 0.2 μm pore size), dried via critical point drying (Leica EM CPD 300), mounted on stubs and coated with gold (JEOL JFC 2300 HR). Samples were viewed with a JEOL IT 300.</p>

                  <p id="Par45">Statistical evaluation of transcriptomics data was based on fold changes and <italic>t</italic> tests including multiple testing correction (Benjamini-Hochberg correction) results calculated by CUFFDIFF. Relative comparison of proteomics data was based on the LFQ intensities calculated by Maxquant. To compare exposed and control samples, fold changes were calculated (mean<sub>exp</sub>/mean<sub>ctrl</sub>) and Welch’s <italic>t</italic> tests were performed. To compare metabolomics data, the peak areas calculated by ChromaTOF were normalized to OD<sub>600</sub> values of the corresponding sample. Afterwards, fold changes and <italic>p</italic> values (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test) for all identified metabolites were calculated. Due to the limitation in replicates and consequently high standard deviations, no multiple testing corrections were performed for proteomics and metabolomics analyses as this would drastically increase stringency on <italic>p</italic> value requirements. However, providing these unique datasets after applying LEO exposure is obligatory and although the significance of the statistical evaluation might be limited (considering a 95 % significance level), looking at the datasets in combination with fold changes and the corrected <italic>p</italic> values from the transcriptomics approach can lead to valid conclusions.</p>
