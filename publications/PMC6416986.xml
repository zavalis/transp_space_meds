                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Plants adapted to diverse environments on Earth throughout their evolutionary history, and developed mechanisms to thrive in a variety of terrestrial habitats. When plants are grown in the novel environment of spaceflight aboard the International Space Station (ISS), an environment completely outside their evolutionary history, they respond with unique alterations to their gene expression profile. Identifying the genes important for physiological adaptation to spaceflight and dissecting the biological processes and pathways engaged by plants during spaceflight has helped reveal spaceflight adaptation, and has furthered understanding of terrestrial growth processes. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms responsible for these changes in gene expression patterns are just beginning to be explored. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation at position five in cytosine, has been shown to play a role in the physiological adaptation to adverse terrestrial environments, and may play a role in spaceflight as well.</p>

                  <p id="Par2">Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing of DNA of Arabidopsis grown on the ISS from seed revealed organ-specific patterns of differential methylation compared to ground controls. The overall levels of methylation in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts were similar between flight and ground DNA, however, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered, and there were clear organ-specific differences in methylation patterns. Spaceflight leaves had higher methylation levels in CHG and CHH contexts within protein-coding genes in spaceflight; about a fifth of the leaf genes were also differentially regulated in spaceflight, almost half of which were associated with reactive oxygen signaling.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight is likely nuanced by epigenomic modification. This is the first examination of differential genomic methylation from plants grown completely in the spaceflight environment of the ISS in plant growth hardware developed for informing exploration life support strategies. Yet even in this optimized plant habitat, plants respond as if stressed. These data suggest that gene expression associated with physiological adaptation to spaceflight is regulated in part by methylation strategies similar to those engaged with familiar terrestrial stress responses. The differential methylation maps generated here provide a useful reference for elucidating the layers of regulation of spaceflight responses.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par20">Plants physiologically adapt to spaceflight using strategies that mimic several aspects of familiar terrestrial environmental responses, even though the spaceflight response is distinct from any singular terrestrial response. Among those strategies are transcriptomic and proteomic alterations that are increasingly well defined as more experiments are conducted on the International Space Station (ISS). Plants have a long history in spaceflight research (recent reviews include: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]). Because of the relationship between gravity and plant architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], plants are considered important tools for discovery of gravity-related biological phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, plant growth in support of closed ecology human life support systems places plant space biology in both discovery and applications roles in the space exploration science agenda.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Near typical plant growth can occur in space within the advanced growth hardware of the ISS. However, evidence from multiple experiments, using a variety of plant species, plant tissues, and in a variety of spaceflight habitats, strongly suggests that physiological adaptation to spaceflight requires an altered state of metabolism and structure that is conditioned by differential gene expression. Early spaceflight gene expression studies suggested that modifications in calcium signaling were important to the metabolic adaptation of plants to spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but did not suggest any singular or particular environmental stress that characterized spaceflight. More recent work on the International Space Station has enabled several highly replicated transcriptome experiments that reveal more about the global transcriptional response of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis), and data now exists for several different cultivars, cell types and growth habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Of particular note is that there are substantial differences in gene expression patterns even among tissue sources of the same genotype; Arabidopsis leaves, hypocotyls, roots, and root tips all have markedly different spaceflight transcriptomes, as do undifferentiated cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par22">Many genes differentially expressed during spaceflight are also differentially expressed during familiar, yet distinct terrestrial stress responses, including stresses involving pathogens, drought, temperature and salt. There are several categories of genes that are well-represented in a variety of terrestrial stress responses that are also well-represented in the spaceflight response. Genes associated with cell wall remodeling, Reactive Oxygen Species signaling, light signal transduction, hormone metabolism, and calcium signaling are represented in multiple abiotic and biotic stress responses on Earth (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The spaceflight environment appears to engage similar cross talk among these genes, and transcriptomic and proteomic evidence can be found from a variety of orbital experiments comprising a diversity of plant systems (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The abundance of representative genes from these categories across cultivars, missions and even species suggests that spaceflight is perceived by plants as an environment requiring a physiological response for acclimation.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Terrestrial plant stresses are increasingly understood to include significant epigenetic changes in the DNA methylome, and epigenome changes have been shown to influence the adaptability of the next generation to a particular stress. Current thought is that a dynamic epigenome plays a much larger role in plant adaptation that previously envisioned. Recent work in plant communities challenged with recurrent stressful events suggests that the epigenetic variation of the plants in these ecosystems are part of the adaptive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and epigenetic regulation has been implicated in the acquisition of herbicide resistance in plant populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Epigenetic responses have also been well documented as important to strategies for pathogen resistance (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]) and in coping with abiotic stressors such as salt, cold, and drought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and at least some of these epigenomic alterations appear to be transmitted through seeds. Further, elucidation of the nature of those epigenome changes can inform genetic modification strategies to breed plants that are more resistant or adaptable to that stress. The same strategy can be applied to any stressor that elicits an epigenomic response, potentially including spaceflight.</p>

              <p id="Par25">In plants, DNA methylation occurs in the CG, CHG and CHH context (where H is A, C, or T), each of which is maintained through cellular divisions by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes including DDM1, VIMs and MET1 (CG), SUVH4 deposited H3K9me2 and CMT3 (CHG), and CMT2 (CHH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p>

              <p id="Par40">When subjected to spaceflight aboard the ISS, plants engage changes in DNA methylation in addition to the now well-characterized changes that occur in gene expression. This conclusion is consistent with the notion that some aspects of gene regulation networks are controlled at the epigenetic level for terrestrial plant stresses and ecological conditions, and suggests that spaceflight physiological adaptation in plants likely involves DNA methylation.</p>
              <p id="Par41">DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many critical aspects of molecular regulation, such as gene and transposon silencing, genomic imprinting as well as X chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Given that epigenetic modifications have been demonstrated to play a key role in gene regulation in multiple systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], DNA methylation likely presents one mechanism whereby an organism takes an environmental cue and tangibly alters its genetic blueprints to respond to that cue, record that genomic alteration, and potentially pass that information on to its progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Despite many demonstrations that DNA methylation is part of terrestrial environmental responses, few DNA methylation studies have been performed in the context of the spaceflight environment. The literature on spaceflight-associated epigenomic studies of plants has thus far included analyses of plants grown on Earth from seeds subjected to the spaceflight environment and seedlings grown on Earth and then subjected to 60 h of spaceflight in a satellite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. In the seed exposure experiment, analyses with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes revealed that the methylation state of 11 genes and 6 transposable elements (TEs) in terrestrially-grown rice plants from seeds flown on the “Long-March-2” spaceship for 18 days was altered compared to the control plants grown from seed that was not exposed to spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. In recent experiments with seedlings grown on the ground for 6 days then exposed to spaceflight on board the SJ-10 recoverable satellite for 60 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], whole seedlings also demonstrated differential DNA methylation between spaceflight and ground controls.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The work presented here represents the first gene-expression correlated, organ specific, whole genome survey of DNA methylation in plants that were sent to space as seeds, then germinated and grew in space under conditions anticipated for plant production in support of human exploration. These ISS grown plants were harvested and preserved by astronauts on orbit, and the frozen samples were returned to Earth for a direct comparison of ISS-grown and Earth-grown leaves and roots. The methylome and correlated transcriptome results from these 11 day old plants strongly reinforce the distinct organ-specific nature of the spaceflight response in that the spaceflight responses in gene expression and DNA methylation were different between roots and leaves. An interesting feature of these data is that while the physiological adaptation to spaceflight did not include large scale, genome wide changes in DNA methylation, the methylation levels within each context shifted toward more highly methylated sites in spaceflight leaves, which changed the distribution of the proportions of CG, CHC and CHH methylation levels. So in leaves, but not roots, the average methylation levels across protein-coding genes changed within each CG, CHG and CHH context. Specific differential methylations were observed in locations relevant to gene expression. The general notion of spaceflight-induced changes in DNA methylation reported here support the overall conclusion obtained with whole seedlings grown on Earth then exposed to a 60 h satellite spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]; however, Xu et al. (2018) observed wide scale hypomethylation in spaceflight, a phenomenon that was not observed in the present study of plants that germinated and lived entirely on the ISS. In addition, a number of genetic mutations were observed in rice seedlings experiencing 18 day of spaceflight in satellites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>], whereas we did not detect any evidence of mutation in the genome of this set of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The source of such distinctions between experiments can be attributed to many factors, including the degree of internal shielding (ISS vs. a satellite), the growth hardware and internal environment, as well as the age and growth strategy of the plants.</p>
              <p id="Par43">It has been reported that hypermethylation in promoters is generally related to repressed transcription levels, especially in that CG methylation near TSS and TTS negatively affects gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. However, in the spaceflight data presented here, both positive and negative correlations were observed between CG methylation and gene expression in leaves (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: Figure S4). Meanwhile, CHH hypermethylation showed a strong correlation to gene upregulation in leaves but not roots, demonstrating the organ-specific molecular regulatory network. In addition, both positive and negative correlations were observed with differential transcription and differential methylation across genic regions in all three contexts. These indicate that any correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression of plants in spaceflight is neither simple nor limited to a specific cytosine context or location with respect to gene structure, though some general trends can be identified in an organ-specific manner. The employment of DNA methylation associated mutant materials in future spaceflight experiments may further clarify the functional relationship between gene expression regulation and different types of DNA methylation.</p>
              <p id="Par44">In leaves, about one fifth of the genes that were significantly differentially expressed by at least two-fold were among those genes that also showed differential methylation, and in roots the fraction was about one third; there were 21 of 75 differentially expressed genes in roots and 143 of 743 differentially expressed genes in leaves that were also differentially methylated. This result suggests that DNA methylation may play a significant role in a portion of the genes regulated by spaceflight, although DNA methylation is clearly not the only factor in the regulation of gene expression in response to spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par45">DNA methylation occurs with great density at repetitive sequences such as the pericentromeric regions, and in light density in euchromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. The non-coding regions flanking active genes can participate the regulation of transcription initiation and abundance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In Arabidopsis, CG methylation is mainly controlled by methyltransferase MET1 and chromatin remodeler DDM1, while CHG and CHH methylation mainly relies on the methyltransferases CMT3 and DRM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. DRM2 dependent non-CG methylation is guided by small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. In our data sets no known RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway genes were differentially expressed. Whereas the increased CHG and CHH methylation levels in coding sequences as well as flanking regions in leaves experiencing spaceflight suggest a possibility that the ISS environment elicits organ-specific effects in CMT3 and/or DRM2-dependent functions in protein-coding genic regions. Moreover, DNA methylation is correlated with genome stability especially in transposable elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. This initial comprehensive investigation uncovered the organ-specific correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression in genes involved in many classes of abiotic stress genes previously associated with a spaceflight response, including representatives of oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall remodeling and defense signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The auxin related genes involved in gravitropism, such as <italic>SAUR</italic> and <italic>GH3</italic> families, were also altered. However, the most prominent category of genes represented in those that are both differentially expressed and differentially methylated in response to spaceflight are those associated with ROS signaling. ROS signaling genes cross into many other metabolic categories, and a recent meta-analysis characterized the extent of how oxidative stress reactions shaped transcriptomic responses, and referred to this complex of ROS-associated genes as the ROS Wheel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Cross referencing the ROS Wheel genes with the spaceflight DmC-DEGs from leaves revealed 46% overlap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S6), which is slightly higher than the proportion of ROS genes in spaceflight DEGs overall (41%). Cross referencing the ROS Wheel genes with other stress-associated transcriptomes, such as osmotic stress (34%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], and pathogen stress (30%) (SUBA3 - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://suba3.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/">http://suba3.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]), reveals that a smaller proportion of these stresses are associated with ROS signaling. In addition, a number of ROS related genes behave in a diverse manner in spaceflight compared with the responses to conventional stresses such as high light exposure (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S6). These data suggest that ROS genes may play a unique role in the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par46">The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings grown in the Veggie hardware on the ISS showed organ-specific differences in gene expression and DNA methylation as compared with the ground controls. Although the overall methylation levels were not significantly changed by spaceflight, thousands of spaceflight differentially methylated cytosine sites were detected in both roots and leaves. Spaceflight leaves showed higher methylation levels in CHG and CHH contexts within protein-coding genes compared with ground control. Moreover, dozens of genes exhibited negative or positive correlation between differential expression and differential methylation in roots and leaves. Over 46% of the differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes were associated with ROS signaling. The work presented here represents the first gene-expression correlated, organ specific, whole genome survey of DNA methylation in plants that were sent to space as seeds, then germinated and grew in space. These data provide fundamental insight into the strategies plants use in the physiological adaptation to the novel environment presented by spaceflight.</p>

The plants were grown for 11 days and individual plates were subsequently removed from Veggie and harvested by astronaut CDR Butch Wilmore into Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlater™ (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA). KFTs provide three levels of liquid containment and are quintessential ISS hardware for studying many aspects molecular biology (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]).

The ground controls were unwrapped, placed into the Veggie ground unit within the ISSES chamber, and grown for 11 days in an identical fashion to the spaceflight samples. The plants were then harvested to KFTs (one plate to tone KFT) and stored in a standard − 80 °C freezer by an astronaut surrogate. The ground KFTs were kept frozen for the same amount of time as the spaceflight samples, and then the frozen samples in each KFT were transferred to individual 50 mL falcon tubes, and remained frozen until delivery to the Principal Investigators for analysis.</p>

RNAseq libraries were constructed using NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) for poly(A) mRNA isolation following manufacturer’s recommendations. Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing was performed similarly to previous experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. In brief, 700–1000 ng of genomic DNA was processed for sequencing library construction. The DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps and sheared into average fragments of ~ 200 bp using the Covaris S2 ultrasonic disruptor, following the manufacturer settings. Fragments of less than 100 bp in size were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio and 300–750 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was obtained. Between 100 and 250 ng of this material was used for Illumina sequencing library construction using the NEBnext Ultra DNA Illumina construction kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) in conjunction with Illumina-specific methylated and barcoded adaptors (New England Biolabs). After end-repair, 3′-adenylation, and adaptor-ligation steps, 75–150 ng of clean, adaptor-ligated DNA fragments (Illumina library) were size-selected to 250–500 bp (average ~ 320 bp) using AMpure beads and recovered in Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 with quantification using a QUBIT fluorimeter (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Likewise, libraries were bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation™ Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting bisulfite converted libraries were enriched by an amplification with 15 cycles using a uracil-insensitive polymerase (NEB) prior to purification with AMPure beads. The final processed libraries were quantified by the QUBIT fluorometer and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an AB17900HT real-time PCR system (Life Technologies). Twelve barcoded bisulfite-seq libraries and 12 barcoded RNA-seq libraries (with triplicates for each condition) were pooled with the ratio of RNA: DNA = 60%: 40% and sequenced on three flow cell lanes on the HiSeq3000 instrument using a 2 × 101 cycle multiplex paired-end reads per lane.</p>
