                <p id="Par1">Space travel induces stresses that contribute to health problems, as well as inducing the expression of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) target genes that mediate adaptive responses to oxidative and other stress responses. The volume of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) in mice increases during spaceflight, a change that is attenuated by <italic>Nrf2</italic> knockout. We conducted metabolome analyses of plasma from wild-type and <italic>Nrf2</italic> knockout mice collected at pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight time points, as well as tissues collected post-flight to clarify the metabolic responses during and after spaceflight and the contribution of Nrf2 to these responses. Plasma glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid levels were elevated during spaceflight, whereas triacylglycerol levels were lower after spaceflight. In wild-type mouse eWAT, triacylglycerol levels were increased, but phosphatidylcholine levels were decreased, and these changes were attenuated in <italic>Nrf2</italic> knockout mice. Transcriptome analyses revealed marked changes in the expression of lipid-related genes in the liver and eWAT after spaceflight and the effects of <italic>Nrf2</italic> knockout on these changes. Based on these results, we concluded that space stress provokes significant responses in lipid metabolism during and after spaceflight; Nrf2 plays critical roles in these responses.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par3">Space stresses, including microgravity and cosmic radiation, are known to evoke various health problems in the body. Salient examples in astronauts are skeletal muscle loss, osteoporosis, central nervous system damage, optic nerve oedema, body weight changes and insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Molecular and cellular characterizations of these responses to space stress converge to the conclusion that these phenotypes are partially attributable to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage, as well as dysregulation of mitochondria and changes in telomeres, epigenetic factors, microbiomes and gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. While increased insights into some of the biological changes that occur during spaceflight have been reported, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of body weight and fat mass volume remain controversial. For instance, some astronauts display a loss of body weight and fat mass volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, while others showed increased or unchanged body mass or comparable scores for related parameters during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Previous studies in mice revealed that lipids accumulated in the liver after spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, the available evidence suggests that body weight and lipid metabolism are subject to intricate regulation during and after spaceflight and that metabolic responses to space stresses are essential for the precise understanding of health problems that arise during and after spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) is a member of the CNC family of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and regulates the expression of a battery of genes that contribute to the protection of cells against oxidative and xenobiotic stresses, including radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Nrf2 also plays important roles in the regulation of metabolism-related genes, such as those involved in glycogen utilization, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Urinary excretion of the oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> increases after habitation in the International Space Station (ISS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, suggesting that Nrf2 activity may be upregulated in response to the elevated oxidative stress during spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We conducted the Mouse Habitat Unit-3 (MHU-3) project that sent six <italic>Nrf2</italic> knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice and six wild-type (WT) mice into space to delineate the roles of Nrf2 during and after spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These Nrf2 KO and WT mice were housed in the Japanese Experiment Module “Kibo” in the ISS for 31 days. In the course of initial analyses, we found that Nrf2 activity is indeed induced by space travel and that both the weight and lipid droplet size of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) are increased in WT mice after spaceflight. In contrast, Nrf2 deletion represses eWAT weight gain and lipid droplet enlargement, indicating the contribution of Nrf2 to the metabolic responses in mice exposed to spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Blood samples obtained from mice during their stay aboard the ISS are critically important to more precisely understand the dynamics of metabolic changes provoked by the stresses of space travel. We propose that blood collection at a minimum of three time points, i.e., pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight, is necessary for informative metabolite analyses. However, while a number of reports have described blood collections before and/or after spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, obtaining blood from mice during their time in space has been technically difficult, and the collection of these samples has not been reported previously. For the MHU-3 project, we developed a special method that enables blood collection from the mouse tail during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, we were able to pursue elaborate metabolome analyses involving blood samples collected at three time points in the MHU-3 project. Two technological advances further supported the MHU-3 project. One is that a system for monitoring mouse food consumption and water drinking coupled with single cage housing technology has been developed to precisely analyse mouse metabolism during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The other is that a video downlink system has been developed for veterinarians to monitor real-time mouse health conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Although we reported the preliminary results of the plasma metabolome analysis of five metabolites in our initial report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we wished to conduct a more comprehensive study of the metabolic responses during spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Therefore, in this study, we performed ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole MS (UHPLC-MS/MS) for a comprehensive metabolomic analyses of plasma collected from the tail to evaluate metabolic responses during and after spaceflight. We also conducted metabolome analyses of post-flight tissue samples, specifically, eWAT lipidomics and brain imaging, using UHPLC Fourier transform MS (UHPLC-FTMS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS imaging (MALDI-MSI) systems, respectively. Of the many salient observations, we found that changes in lipid metabolites in the plasma and tissues were particularly significant. For instance, in WT mice, the plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and cholesteryl esters (CEs) were markedly increased in the in-flight samples, whereas those of triacylglycerols (TGs) were decreased in post-flight samples. These metabolic responses during spaceflight were substantially abrogated in the plasma of Nrf2 KO mice. We also performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses and documented altered expression of metabolism-related genes in the liver and eWAT after spaceflight, as well as the underlying contributions of Nrf2 to these responses. This study supports our hypothesis that space stresses induce specific and severe metabolic responses and that Nrf2 plays important roles in the adaptive response to stress during and after spaceflight.</p>

                <p id="Par8">Six WT and six Nrf2 KO mice were launched into space and stayed aboard the ISS for 31 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Blood samples were collected from the tail at three time points, i.e., pre-flight (17 days before launch; referred to as L-17), in-flight (18 days after launch; L+18), and post-flight (2 days after return; R+2). Blood samples were also collected from the inferior vena cava (IVC) at R+2 under anaesthesia. We conducted a ground control (GC) experiment in a similar manner to the spaceflight (FL) experiment. Blood collection from FL-WT mouse No. 8 (FL08) at L+18 was omitted upon recommendation of the veterinarians due to minor injury of the tail. In addition, FL-KO mouse No. 4 (FL04) suffered intestinal haemorrhage during the return flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We analysed the levels of ketone bodies in IVC blood samples from individual mice at R + 2 using NMR to determine whether the data from mouse FL04 needed to be excluded. Mouse FL04 displayed extremely elevated levels of ketone bodies compared with the other 23 mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a-c</xref>), indicating that the metabolic conditions of mouse FL04 were different from those of the other mice. Thus, the data from mouse FL04 were excluded from this study. Collectively, five samples were collected at L+18 and six samples were collected at L-17 and R+2 from the FL-WT group; five samples were collected from the FL-KO group at each of the three time points.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Plasma collection and metabolome analyses in the MHU-3 project.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic presentation of the MHU-3 project in which spaceflight (FL) and ground control (GC) experiments were performed.

                <title>Plasma lipid levels are elevated during spaceflight depending on the Nrf2 genotype</title>
                <p id="Par9">We performed plasma metabolome analyses using tail blood samples to evaluate metabolic responses during and after spaceflight. As we were only able to collect small volumes of plasma from the tails, we applied a UHPLC-MS-MS method and measured the plasma levels of 624 metabolites (dataset M624, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). We classified metabolites into four groups according to the criteria established by MetIDQ Oxygen software provided by the manufacturer (Biocrates Life Sciences), which mainly assessed the reliability of the data. Group 1 included metabolites below the limit of detection, Group 2 included metabolites above the limit of internal standards, Group 3 included metabolites below the lower limit of quantification or above the upper limit of quantification, and Group 4 included metabolites within the lower and upper limits of quantification. We then selected 241 qualified metabolites in Groups 3 and 4 (dataset M241) for further analysis.</p>
                <p id="Par10">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> presents a heatmap showing an overview of metabolic responses identified in the MHU-3 project. We refined the M241 dataset further and selected 104 metabolites based on the criterion that the coefficient of variation (CV) was 30% or less (dataset M104). The mean value of the FL-WT group at L-17 was set to 1.0 for the FL group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) and that of the GC-WT group at L-17 was set to 1.0 for the GC group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In FL-WT mice, the plasma levels of lipids, especially cholesteryl esters, glycerophospholipids [including lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs)] and sphingolipids [including sphingomyelins (SMs)], were markedly increased in the L+18 in-flight samples compared to the L-17 pre-flight samples. Notably, the levels of many glycerophospholipids in R+2 post-flight samples decreased below the levels in L-17 samples in FL-WT mice, but the levels of sphingolipids and cholesteryl esters were further increased at R+2 compared to L-17 and L+18.</p>
                <p id="Par11">An intriguing observation is that the increased levels of cholesteryl esters, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in L+18 FL-WT mice were markedly attenuated in FL-KO mice. These results indicate that plasma levels of cholesteryl esters, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids were elevated during spaceflight and that Nrf2 contributed to the increased levels of these lipids in the L+18 samples. However, the decreases in the levels of these lipids in R+2 post-flight samples appeared to be independent of Nrf2 activity. We surmise that the return to Earth gravity must impose severe stress for the mice and provoke these changes.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> presents the heatmap showing an overview of the metabolic response observed in the GC experiment. We found that M104 metabolite levels were not significantly altered during the simulated flight. These data further support our conclusion that the increases in the plasma levels of cholesteryl esters, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids during spaceflight are dependent on Nrf2.</p>

In contrast, dataset M241 includes 69 triacylglycerols (Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Therefore, we plotted relative metabolite levels according to metabolite ID. Showing very good agreement with the M104 heatmap analyses, the levels of glycerophospholipids (M241 ID #90–161) and sphingolipids (#162–172) in FL-WT mouse samples increased at L+18 compared to L-17 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, blue dots).

                <p id="Par16">We first performed principal component analysis (PCA) for a dimensional reduction of the M241 dataset to examine the effect of spaceflight on metabolic regulation. PC1 or PC2 did not separate the three time points L-17, L+18 and R+2 in GC-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2a</xref>). In contrast, PC1 separated R+2 and L-17, and PC2 separated L+18 and L-17 in FL-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2b</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, since the levels of glycerophospholipids were altered during spaceflight, we performed PCA of 72 glycerophospholipids. PC2 only slightly separated R+2, but not L+18, from the L-17 time point in GC-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2c</xref>). In contrast, both PC1 and PC2 separated L+18 and R+2 from L-17 in FL-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). Based on these results, spaceflight potently influenced plasma metabolite levels, and glycerophospholipid levels were altered in in-flight samples collected from FL-WT mice at L+18.</p>

In contrast, the levels were comparable between L+18 and L-17 in GC-WT mice (#2, red line), indicating that the LysoPC C18:0 level was specifically increased during spaceflight. Meanwhile, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>, the LysoPC C18:0 levels measured at R+2 in FL-WT mice were comparable to those measured at L-17 in the same FL-WT mice (#3, purple line). Similarly, the level recorded at R+2 was comparable to that detected at L-17 in GC-WT mice (#4, red line). Thus, the plasma LysoPC C18:0 levels were increased specifically during spaceflight (L+18), but the levels were restored to control levels soon after return to the ground (R+2), indicating the importance of collecting plasma samples during spaceflight to clarify the genuine effects of space stress.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Based on these comparisons, we selected 109 metabolites that were significantly altered in the L+18 and R+2 samples from FL-WT mice for comparison with L-17 samples from FL-WT mice (#1 and #3, respectively). Precise changes are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Groups A–G. Metabolites that changed only at one time point are also shown in the panel; for example, when a metabolite level was increased in FL-WT/L+18 but not significantly altered in FL-WT/R+2 compared to FL-WT/L-17, the metabolite was categorized in Group A. Group H represents unchanged metabolites. These 109 modulated metabolites included 1 amino acid, 7 amino acid-related metabolites, 44 glycerophospholipids, 7 sphingolipids, 36 triacylglycerols and 14 other metabolites (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3d</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par20">Of the 109 metabolites, 40 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, A–C</xref>) and 8 (C and D) metabolite levels were elevated in FL-WT mice at L+18 and R+2 compared to L-17, respectively, indicating that the levels of a considerable number of metabolites were indeed increased during spaceflight. Venn diagrams illustrate that the levels of 34 metabolites (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Groups A and B) were increased only at L+18, while the levels of 2 metabolites (D) were increased only at R+2, and the levels of 6 metabolites (C) were commonly increased at both L+18 and R+2 (left). In clear contrast, the levels of 9 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Groups E and F) and 80 (Groups B, F and G) metabolites were decreased at L+18 and R+2 compared to L-17 in FL-WT mice, respectively. These observations suggest that space stresses promote increased levels of plasma metabolites, but the return to Earth gravity acts to swiftly reduce the levels of these metabolites, e.g., PC aa C36:1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par21">We evaluated the relationships between in-flight (L+18) and post-flight (R+2) changes in metabolite levels in FL-WT mice by plotting fold changes (FCs) at L+18 and R+2 <italic>vs</italic>.

The metabolite that showed the greatest increase at L+18 was LysoPC a C18:0, the details of which are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>, c. Notably, the levels of many glycerophospholipids (green dots) were increased at L+18 but decreased at R+2. In contrast, the levels of several sphingolipids (red dots) were increased at both L+18 and R+2, and the sphingolipid with the highest level measured at R+2 was SM(OH) C14:1. The levels of an amino acid (cyan plot) and amino acid-related metabolites (magenta plots) were decreased at both L+18 and R+2. Most impressively, triacylglycerol levels (orange plots) were markedly decreased at both L+18 and R+2. The explanation for why these groups of metabolites showed distinctly different profiles remains to be clarified.</p>
                <p id="Par22">Two representative metabolites that showed significant alterations at L+18 (in-flight) were LysoPC a C18:0 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>) and PC aa C36:1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Plasma levels of LysoPC a C18:0 and PC aa C36:1 were increased in FL-WT mice at L+18. In contrast, the levels of these metabolite did not change substantially in GC-WT mice.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Three representative metabolites whose levels did not change substantially during spaceflight but showed significant alterations after return to Earth (at R+2) were citrulline and PC aa C40:2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, g</xref>). The levels of these metabolites were markedly decreased in the post-flight (R+2) samples from FL-WT mice; a similar decrease was not observed in GC-WT mice. In contrast, the plasma levels of SM(OH) C14:1 were increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>) at both L+18 and R+2 in FL-WT mice, but the levels did not change substantially at the three time points in GC-WT mice. Thus, the metabolic response during spaceflight involves diverse metabolites but is predominantly characterized by increases in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid levels, as well as decreases in triacylglycerol levels.</p>

These results again indicate that metabolic responses during spaceflight were significantly different from those observed after the return to ground and that Nrf2 KO attenuates metabolic responses during and after spaceflight.

The levels of these triacylglycerols were increased even more significantly in the eWAT of GC-KO/R+2 and FL-KO/R+2 mice.

Importantly, space travel and the Nrf2 KO genotype induced similar changes in the levels of these phosphatidylcholines but did not provoke strong additive changes. We then evaluated the total triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine levels in the eWAT of all mice exposed to spaceflight and found that total triacylglycerol levels were elevated in both FL-WT/R+2 and GC-KO/R+2 eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).

Lipid droplet size was strongly correlated with the levels of PC C34:2 and TG(50:2) in eWAT. These data indicate that both spaceflight and the Nrf2 KO genotype modulated the triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine contents, which correlated with eWAT lipid droplet size. Thus, we conclude that Nrf2 contributes to the regulation of lipid metabolism in eWAT both on the ground and in space.</p>

For the RNA-seq analyses, we selected the liver, cerebrum and eWAT because of the novel contributions of these organs and tissue to the regulation of lipid metabolism. With a mean transcripts per million (TPM) value ≥5 as the selection criterion, we selected 9945, 7542 and 11464 genes in eWAT, liver and cerebrum, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">4</xref>-<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">6</xref>).

                <p id="Par35">We further evaluated how the loss of Nrf2 influenced these changes by examining the tissues from Nrf2 KO mice and found that the expression of 14.5% and 7.7% of genes was altered in GC-KO/R+2 and FL-KO/R+2 eWAT samples compared with GC-WT/R+2 and FL-WT/R+2 eWAT, respectively. Similarly, we observed altered expression of 11.9% and 17.0% genes in the liver and 8.9% and 6.7% genes in the cerebrum of GC-KO/R+2 and FL-KO/R+2 mice compared with GC-WT/R+2 and FL-WT/R+2 mice, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Thus, spaceflight itself influenced gene expression more substantially than Nrf2 KO in the eWAT and liver. In contrast, spaceflight modulated gene expression in the cerebrum less significantly than the Nrf2 KO genotype.</p>

Notably, while space travel and Nrf2 KO both broadly affected the gene expression profiles in eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b and c</xref>, respectively), the differences in the profiles between FL-KO/R+2 and FL-WT/R+2 eWAT were rather smaller (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>) than those in the FL-WT/R+2 and GC-WT/R+2 eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) and GC-KO/R+2 and GC-WT/R+2 eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) comparisons, suggesting that the space stresses and Nrf2 KO appeared to counteract the effects of the other on changing in gene expression. In contrast, while space travel and Nrf2 KO widely affected the gene expression profile in the liver (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e and f</xref>, respectively), the difference between FL-KO/R+2 and FL-WT/R+2 livers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>) was significantly larger than that in GC-KO/R+2 and GC-WT/R+2 livers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>), suggesting that space stresses augmented the changes in gene expression observed in Nrf2 KO mouse livers.</p>

                <p id="Par39">We next evaluated how the loss of Nrf2 altered the expression of these 11 genes. Based upon the responses to space stresses and Nrf2 KO, we classified the genes into three categories. First, we observed comparable expression of <italic>Abcg1</italic> and <italic>Thbs1</italic> between GC-WT/R+2 and GC-KO/R+2 and between FL-WT/R+2 and FL-KO/R+2, indicating that space stresses induced the expression of these two genes through certain signalling pathway(s) independent of the Nrf2 signalling pathway. We named this category as Class 1.</p>
                <p id="Par40">Second, the expression of <italic>Srfp5</italic>, <italic>Fasn</italic>, <italic>Scd1</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic> was significantly induced in the GC-KO/R+2 eWAT compared with that of GC-WT/R+2 eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c–e</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). Of these four genes, <italic>Srfp5</italic> expression increased, but the expression of the other three genes decreased in the FL-KO/R+2 eWAT compared with GC-KO/R+2 eWAT. Importantly, the expression of these four genes was comparable between FL-WT/R+2 and FL-KO/R+2 eWAT. These results thus indicate that Nrf2 KO-induced changes in the expression of these genes were either abrogated or attenuated by exposure to space stresses. Certain signalling pathway(s) regulate gene expression during spaceflight, and the effect of spaceflight seems to be stronger than that of the Nrf2 signalling pathway, such that space stresses either override or counteract the regulatory cue from Nrf2 KO. We named this category of genes as Class 2.</p>
                <p id="Par41">In the third category of genes, or Class 3, we identified five genes for which Nrf2 KO dominated the effect of space stresses. Of these five genes, <italic>Epor</italic>, <italic>Gstm1, Mc2r</italic> and <italic>Oxtr</italic> were expressed at higher levels after exposure to space stresses, while <italic>Ces1f</italic> was expressed at a lower level. Nrf2 KO either abolished or substantially weakened their expression in eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f–h</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b, c</xref>). The increase in <italic>Epor</italic> and <italic>Gstm1</italic> expression observed during spaceflight was substantially abrogated by Nrf2 KO. The expression of <italic>Ces1f</italic> was strongly repressed by Nrf2 KO, while that of <italic>Mc2r</italic> was increased substantially in both GC-KO/R+2 and FL-KO/R+2 eWAT. Thus, while the expression of these genes was regulated by both Nrf2 and space stresses, Nrf2 signalling appeared to dominate the regulatory mechanism.</p>

Similar changes were observed for PC C36:4. When the MSI signals were quantified, we found that the PC C34:1 and C36:4 signals in FL-WT/R+2 mice were slightly lower than those in GC-WT/R+2 mice in both the cortex and hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7c, d</xref>).

              <p id="Par51">We examined how space stress or the loss of Nrf2 influences metabolic regulation in mice individually and in combination by conducting detailed metabolome analyses utilizing plasma samples collected at pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight time points in space-travelled and ground control mice in the MHU-3 project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Therefore, we surmise that post-flight studies may reflect the combination of genuine space stresses and the effects of returning to Earth gravity. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to successfully complete a three-time point comparison of plasma metabolites using blood samples collected from the tail before, during and after spaceflight. Since the in-flight samples obtained in this study are not impacted by re-entry to gravity, this study permits us to evaluate the effect of space stresses independently of the stresses of returning to Earth gravity.</p>
              <p id="Par52">As summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>, the plasma levels of lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and cholesteryl esters increased during spaceflight. In contrast, as summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>, plasma levels of triacylglycerols decreased after returning to Earth. Importantly, these metabolic changes in plasma lipid levels were largely abrogated in Nrf2 KO mice. Notably, in the tissue metabolome analyses using the spaceflight samples, triacylglycerol levels increased, while phosphatidylcholine levels decreased in eWAT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), suggesting the presence of dynamic metabolic changes in plasma and tissues after returning to Earth gravity. Thus, plasma metabolite levels are substantially different between in-flight samples and post-flight samples and that Nrf2 activity in fact alters metabolite levels in these plasma samples.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><title>Metabolic response and changes in gene expression during and after spaceflight.</title><p><bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold> Schematic representations of metabolic responses during (<bold>a</bold>) and after (<bold>b</bold>) spaceflight.

              <p id="Par53">We also conducted extensive transcriptome analyses utilizing tissues from post-flight and ground control mice. We categorized differentially expressed genes into three classes according to their responses to space stresses and loss of Nrf2. The expression of genes in Class 1 changed substantially in response to space travel but not Nrf2 KO. The expression of genes in Class 2 was influenced by Nrf2 KO but substantially overridden by space stresses, and the expression of genes in Class 3 was influenced by space travel, but the changes were largely overridden by the loss of Nrf2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8c, d</xref>). Transcriptome analyses of post-flight and ground control mouse tissues revealed that the expression of <italic>Apoa4</italic> and <italic>Apoa5</italic> was induced in the liver after spaceflight. Apolipoproteins contribute to lipid transport in plasma, and lipoproteins are abundant in lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We found that the expression of <italic>Lcat</italic> and <italic>Agpat3</italic> was also increased in the liver after spaceflight, and these genes were categorized into Class 1. LCAT catalyses the conversion of free cholesterol to cholesteryl ester and increases plasma cholesterol levels in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, ApoA4 enhances the activation of LCAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, the combined induction of LCAT and ApoA4 increases plasma cholesteryl ester levels. AGPAT3 exerts acyltransferase activity and catalyses the synthesis of phosphatidic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, a precursor for lipid biosynthesis. These results support the hypothesis that the induction of this set of genes contributes to the increased plasma lipid levels measured during spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par54">We also identified five Class 3 genes in the liver that may account for the specific metabolic changes in the plasma during spaceflight and the contributions of Nrf2 KO to these changes. Similarly, we surmise that the increase in eWAT in ground control Nrf2 KO mice may be attributable to the upregulation of three FA synthesis-related genes in Class 2, i.e.<italic>, Scd1</italic>, <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, in eWAT. These genes may also play roles in regulating the accumulation of triacylglycerols in GC-KO mouse eWAT. However, the expression of these genes is repressed in post-flight eWAT, suggesting that FA synthesis in eWAT is downregulated in post-flight mice.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Similarly, we have reported that the weights and lipid droplet sizes of eWAT were increased after the month-long flight in the MHU-3 project<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, the increase in eWAT volume in the post-flight mice is likely attributable to factors other than the increase in FA synthesis. An intriguing related observation is that the expression of <italic>Abcg1</italic> was substantially increased, but that of <italic>Ces1f</italic> in eWAT and triacylglycerol levels in plasma were significantly decreased after spaceflight. Although ABCG1 is best known as a cholesterol transporter, studies of <italic>Abcg1</italic> knockout mice revealed that ABCG1 also plays important roles in FA transport and lipid storage in adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. CES1F hydrolyses triacylglycerols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Taken together, these observations suggest that in post-spaceflight mice, combined increases in FA uptake through increased ABCG1 expression and the suppression of triacylglycerol hydrolysis through the repression of CES1F expression led to increased weight and lipid droplet sizes in the eWAT.</p>
              <p id="Par56">We surmise that the following observations may also be pertinent to this discussion. After spaceflight, the expression of <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Scd1</italic> was suppressed in eWAT, but the expression of <italic>Acadm</italic> and <italic>Acadl</italic> was induced in the liver. FASN and SCD1 catalyse the de novo synthesis and desaturation of FAs, respectively, while both ACADM and ACADL enhance the β-oxidation of FA in the liver. In addition, <italic>Sfrp5</italic> expression was increased in eWAT after spaceflight. <italic>Sfrp5</italic> encodes the SFRP5 protein, an adipokine that suppresses lipid accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. A simple and straightforward interpretation of these observations would predict that the levels of FAs in eWAT and plasma would decrease due to suppressed FA synthesis and enhanced catabolism. However, plasma FA levels do not show a clear decrease during and after spaceflight. Thus, a 1-month stay in space might not be sufficient to induce the expected FA profile. Indeed, human studies have shown that long-term spaceflight decreases body weight and fat volume in astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The changes in the gene expression profile observed in this study should contribute to improving our understanding of the decreases in body weight that occur during space travel.</p>
              <p id="Par57">In the post-flight liver, the expression levels of <italic>Fabp2</italic>, <italic>Cd36</italic> and <italic>Plin2</italic> were markedly elevated. <italic>Fabp2</italic> knockout mice display increased plasma triacylglycerol levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, as intestinal-type FA-binding protein I-FABP (product of <italic>Fabp2</italic>) decreases plasma triacylglycerol levels. CD36 is a multi-functional molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. CD36 overexpression increases FA uptake by the liver in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and CD36 also functions as a thrombospondin-1 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The expression of <italic>Thbs1</italic>, the gene encoding thrombospondin-1, is also increased in eWAT after spaceflight. Thrombospondin-1 is an adipokine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> that exacerbates hepatic dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Thus, the increased expression of CD36 in the liver and thrombospondin-1 in eWAT might synergistically affect biological functions during space travel. In addition, perilipin 2, encoded by <italic>Plin2</italic>, regulates lipid formation, and <italic>Plin2</italic>-null mice exhibit abnormalities in plasma triacylglycerol levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Therefore, the changes in <italic>Plin2</italic> expression may contribute to the decrease in plasma triacylglycerol levels observed after spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par58">In this study, we also found that the expression of a number of endocrine-related genes were affected by spaceflight. For instance, the expression of <italic>Dio2</italic>, which encodes type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2), was decreased, while the expression of <italic>Cort</italic> (encoding cortistatin) was increased in the cerebrum after spaceflight. The expression of the latter gene is also regulated by Nrf2. The changes in D2 and cortistatin expression seem pertinent to the changes in lipid metabolism observed during spaceflight, as D2 contributes to the conversion of the prohormone thyroxine to the active form triiodothyronine, which is known to regulate tissue phospholipid levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Similarly, cortistatin is a somatostatin-related cyclic neuropeptide that regulates insulin secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In addition, the expression levels of <italic>Epor, Mc2r</italic> and <italic>Oxtr</italic>, which encode receptors of erythropoietin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin, respectively, were increased in eWAT after spaceflight. We speculate that these changes may also be related to the observed metabolic changes, especially since erythropoietin signalling is reported to regulate lipid droplet size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and erythropoietin receptor contributes to preadipocyte differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Similarly, although the roles of ACTH and oxytocin receptors in signalling within eWAT have not been fully clarified, ACTH is known to regulate metabolism in brown adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, and oxytocin receptor signalling exerts insulin-like activity in adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. However, the effects of spaceflight on endocrine systems and their contributions to the regulation of lipid metabolism remain to be clarified.</p>
              <p id="Par59">In addition to metabolism- and endocrine system-related genes, spaceflight induces the expression of the antioxidant and detoxification enzyme gene <italic>Gstm1</italic> in eWAT in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Although GST mu1 is known to play important roles in detoxification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, it also increases the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and contributes to metabolic regulation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, upregulation of <italic>Gstm1</italic> gene expression might contribute to both detoxification and metabolic regulation.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Based on our findings, Nrf2 is involved in metabolic responses during and after spaceflight. Nrf2-inducing chemicals are used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> or are in clinical trials for diabetic kidney disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. An Nrf2-inducing chemical protects metabolism-related organs and tissues and contributes to maintaining metabolic homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Although we have not experimentally examined whether the activation of Nrf2 signalling actually modulates the metabolic response in spaceflight, the available evidence suggests that Nrf2 induction is useful for adaptation to the space environment.</p>
              <p id="Par61">In conclusion, these findings show that space stresses induce metabolic changes in the plasma and eWAT. The altered expression of metabolism-related genes suggests that a metabolic response in plasma occurs in space travel as a result of gene regulation in the eWAT and liver. In addition, the lipid metabolic changes in eWAT after spaceflight are strongly correlated with eWAT lipid droplet size, indicating that these metabolic changes indeed contribute to the health problems observed during space travel. This study also provides important evidence for the contributions of Nrf2 to the metabolic response to space stresses, and Nrf2 may be a new target to maintain metabolic homeostasis during space travel for astronauts, tourists and settlers.</p>

Tail plasma samples (5 µL) were used for the UHPLC-MS/MS analyses (Xevo TQ-S system, Waters). The eWAT samples used for the lipidomics analysis were stored at −80 °C until LC-MS analysis. eWAT samples of 10–50 mg were homogenized in the optimal volume of methanol (10 μL per mg of tissue) and prepared using a previously reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>; the eWAT extracts were then subjected to UHPLC-FTMS (QExactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The UHPLC conditions were modified from a previously reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Separation was performed using a metal-free C18 column (L-column2 ODS, 2.0 mm i.d. × 100 mm, 2-µm particle size; CERI). The mobile phase consisted of 60/40/1 (v/v/v%) acetonitrile/water/ammonium formate (1 mol/L) containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and 10/90 (v/v%) acetonitrile/isopropanol containing 0.1% formic acid (B). Metabolites were separated with a gradient; the initial condition was 30% B at a rate of 0.2 mL/min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% B from 2.0 to 20.0 min and 100% B for 10.0 min. Then, the mobile phase was returned to the initial condition and maintained for 5.0 min until the end of the run. The total run time was 35.0 min. The temperature of the column compartment was 45 °C. The FTMS system was equipped with a heated ESI-II source. The voltages used in positive and negative ion modes were 3.5 and 2.5 kV, respectively. The heated capillary temperature was 275 °C, the sheath gas pressure was 45 psi, the auxiliary gas setting was 10 psi, and the heated vaporizer temperature was 300 °C. Both the sheath gas and auxiliary gas were nitrogen. The collision gas was argon at a pressure of 1.5 mTorr. The FTMS scan type was full MS/data-dependent (dd)-MS<sup>2</sup>. The parameters of the full mass scan were as follows: resolution 70,000, autogain control target under 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>, maximum isolation time 100 ms, and <italic>m/z</italic> range 350–1050.

The UHPLC-FTMS system was controlled by Xcalibur 4.2.28.14 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and data were collected with the associated software. The chemical standards of lipid species were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids and analysed using UHPLC-FTMS to confirm the adduct ion for each group of lipid species, to obtain the fragment ion mass spectra for identification of the fatty acids of lipid species, and to provide the retention time information needed to discriminate species with different numbers of carbons or double bonds within the same group of lipids.</p>
