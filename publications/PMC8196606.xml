                <p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the principal structure of bone tissue. Long-term spaceflights lead to osteopenia, which may be a result of the changes in composition as well as remodeling of the ECM by osteogenic cells. To elucidate the cellular effects of microgravity, human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their osteocommitted progeny were exposed to simulated microgravity (SMG) for 10 days using random positioning machine (RPM). After RPM exposure, an imbalance of MSC collagen/non-collagen ratio at the expense of a decreased level of collagenous proteins was detected. At the same time, the secretion of proteases (cathepsin A, cathepsin D, MMP3) was increased. No significant effects of SMG on the expression of stromal markers and cell adhesion molecules on the MSC surface were noted. Upregulation of <italic>COL11A1</italic>, <italic>CTNND1</italic>, <italic>TIMP3</italic>, and <italic>TNC</italic> and downregulation of <italic>HAS1</italic>, <italic>ITGA3</italic>, <italic>ITGB1</italic>, <italic>LAMA3</italic>, <italic>MMP1</italic>, and <italic>MMP11</italic> were detected in RPM exposed MSCs. ECM-associated transcriptomic changes were more pronounced in osteocommitted progeny. Thus, 10 days of SMG provokes a decrease in the collagenous components of ECM, probably due to the decrease in collagen synthesis and activation of proteases. The presented data demonstrate that ECM-associated molecules of both native and osteocommitted MSCs may be involved in bone matrix reorganization during spaceflight.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) comprises a significant part of connective tissues and determines their mechanical properties. Mechanical strength is of great importance for all connective tissues. This is one of the reasons to pay attention to peculiarities of the ECM under microgravity conditions. Connective tissue ECM is formed mainly by two types of macromolecules, fibrillar proteins and proteoglycans. The first are represented by several types of collagens and elastin. Collagen I is the main structural component of bone tissue that provides its tensile strength [<xref rid="B1-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Proteoglycans consist of proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), non-branching polysaccharide molecules that occupy a large volume and are unable to fold into globules such as proteins. These molecules carry negative charges and, therefore, they can retain a large amount of osmotically active ions and water, which creates a high turgor pressure of the ECM and its compressive strength. Due to proteoglycans, ECM deposits numerous growth factors that belong to the FGF, VEGF, TGF, etc., families, thus ensuring their stable levels in the pericellular space or the release of large amounts during degradation [<xref rid="B2-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Proteoglycan levels determine matrix mineralization and collagen fiber diameters in bone tissue [<xref rid="B4-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>ECM components are associated with the cytoskeleton through cell adhesive structures, whereby mechanical stress is transmitted in the intercellular space and inside the cells, affecting cellular signaling and gene expression [<xref rid="B5-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The ECM continuously undergoes structural changes through synthesis, degradation, mineralization, and other processes [<xref rid="B6-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These processes depend on various factors, the most important being the mechanical load or its critical decrease in spaceflight. For example, a decrease in bone mineral density, which is associated with the reorganization of ECM, was detected after long-term spaceflights [<xref rid="B7-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Osteopenia in microgravity is caused by both systemic and cellular factors. Currently, a decreased support loading, redistribution of body fluid pressure, osteoclast activation, reduction in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and lysis of osteocytes are considered to be the main factors in the development of osteopenia [<xref rid="B10-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, a loss of bone tissue calcium is aggravated by parathyroid hormone regulation, resulting in reduced calcium reabsorption in the kidneys [<xref rid="B7-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To study the effects of microgravity on stromal cells, different cell types were applied as well as different approaches to simulate microgravity [<xref rid="B12-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>The current concept suggests that impaired cell physiology under microgravity is the trigger of negative changes in bone tissue [<xref rid="B17-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is supported by numerous data from in vitro experiments conducted aboard space vehicles and under ground-based microgravity simulations. The reduced osteogenic potential of osteoblasts and low commitment of stromal progenitors in vitro has been convincingly demonstrated [<xref rid="B19-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, a downregulation of osteogenic-associated genes and upstream signaling pathway genes has been observed [<xref rid="B23-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The changes in ECM composition during osteogenic differentiation may alter the mechanical properties of the tissue and also affect certain signaling pathways involved in osteogenic commitment [<xref rid="B25-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>
              <p>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) participate in the maintenance of homeostasis in many tissues, including bone. Being osteoblast precursors, MSCs actively participate in ECM production and remodeling, which have been investigated for medical purposes [<xref rid="B28-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These cells are important for proper execution of osteogenesis and response to microgravity. Under simulated microgravity, MSCs have demonstrated changes in functional state, response to inflammatory stimulation, the production of many proteins, and gene expression [<xref rid="B31-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Multidirectional changes in the transcription of genes encoding ECM proteins and associated molecules were found in response to SMG. The transcriptomic shifts depended on cell type and exposure time [<xref rid="B33-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
              <p>An upregulation of <italic>COL4A5</italic> and the main matrix glycoprotein, fibronectin (<italic>FN</italic>), as well as enzymes involved in ECM remodeling (<italic>MMP1</italic> and <italic>MMP3</italic>) was found after 3 days of RPM exposure of fibroblasts [<xref rid="B37-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. After 7 days of 2D clinorotation, an increased expression of <italic>COL1</italic> and <italic>COL3</italic> was detected in MSCs [<xref rid="B36-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, there are data on downregulation of <italic>Col1a</italic> and <italic>Fbn1</italic> (fibrillin) following 7-day clinorotation [<xref rid="B36-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Regardless of the mode and exposure time, a decreased transcription of osteomodulin (<italic>OMD</italic>) that regulates osteoblast adhesion was demonstrated for preosteoblasts [<xref rid="B20-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The available data do not allow drawing certain conclusions about the patterns of ECM remodeling. Meanwhile, the experimental data in this field could expand the knowledge of how the activity of stromal cells determines changes in bone tissue under microgravity. The purpose of this study was to analyze the peculiarities of ECM changes under the influence of simulated microgravity on MSCs in vitro.</p>

                <p>Primary MSCs (3–4 passages) satisfied the minimal criteria of the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT) statements [<xref rid="B40-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. They had fibroblast-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f001">Figure 1</xref>a).

Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in the presence of the appropriate stimuli was shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f001">Figure 1</xref>c).</p>

                <title>2.2. MSC Commitment to the Osteoblast Lineage</title>
                <p>Inducers of osteogenic differentiation were added to the culture medium for 7 days. Increased activity of alkaline phosphatase was shown using a cytochemistry method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). Alkaline phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of organic phosphate esters in the extracellular space. An increase in the activity of this enzyme is one of the early signs of MSC osteo-differentiation. At the same time, after 7-day exposure, MSCs retained the progenitor properties and did not show signs of matrix mineralization that is the typical marker of the late stage of osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="B41-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
                <p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed more than 2-fold upregulation of osteogenesis-associated genes (<italic>RUNX2</italic>, <italic>ALPL</italic>, <italic>OPG</italic>, <italic>SP7</italic>, <italic>BGLAP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f002">Figure 2</xref>b).

                <title>2.3. SMG Effects on Immunophenotype and Adhesion Molecules</title>
                <p>The flasks with osteocommitted (Ost) and intact (Int) MSCs were placed on the random positioning machine (RPM) for 10 days. A part of the flasks was left as a static control (Stat). During the experiment, the cells retained their adhesive properties. In all experimental groups, the MSCs formed a dense cell monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). Cell viability, morphology, and immunophenotype were studied using flow cytometry. Viability assessment did not reveal the significant cell death under simulated microgravity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The share of living MSCs remained high in all samples (≥94%). To evaluate the cell size and granularity, forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), respectively, were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). It was shown the average size of osteocommitted cells is significantly smaller than that of intact cells. Cytoplasmic granularity did not differ significantly between the experimental groups.</p>
                <p>Analysis of the main MSC markers showed a decrease in CD73, CD90, CD105 expression during osteocommitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This effect was not associated with the average cell size reduction. To demonstrate this, we gated cells of the same sizes (R1) and compared gated MSCs in experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Despite the same sizes in the R1 gates, a significant difference in the expression of stromal markers persisted.</p>
                <p>Osteocommitment led to decreased expression of CD44 (HCAM), CD54 (ICAM), CD51/61 (integrin αv/β3), CD49b (Integrin α2) on cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At the same time, the expression of CD29 (Integrin β1), CD49a (Integrin α1), and CD49e (Integrin α5) did not change.</p>
                <p>No significant effects of 10-day SMG on the expression of stromal markers and cell adhesion molecules were found. Interestingly, that short-term (96 h) exposure of MSCs under SMG reduced the expression of CD105, CD51/61, CD44, and CD54 and altered the transcription activity of several genes associated with adhesion and extracellular matrix [<xref rid="B42-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Probably, longer exposure allows MSCs to adapt to SMG and restore the normal expression of certain surface molecules.</p>

                <p>To assess the content of ECM components after 10 days of RPM exposure, we used Sirius Red F3BA and Fast Green FCF dyes, which selectively bind to collagenous and non-collagenous proteins, respectively. Then, the dyes were extracted, and the optical densities of the solutions were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The results showed an increase in ECM non-collagenous proteins after RPM exposure. These proteins were increased up to 35% in the intact MSCs, while the osteo-MSCs demonstrated a 20% increase. A 15% decrease of ECM collagen components was shown in intact cells after RPM exposure. Some tendency was found in osteocommitted MSCs, but the changes were not significant.</p>
                <p>The conditioned medium was analyzed using Proteome Profiler Human Protease Array Kit. The 7 days of osteocommitment lead to decreased production of cathepsin B and MMP3 (matrix metalloproteinase-3) and increased cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Both intact and osteo-MSCs demonstrated the alteration of protease production in a similar manner under SMG. Increased secretion of cathepsin A, cathepsin D, and MMP3 was detected. Interestingly, RPM exposure resulted in an enhanced level of MMP2 in intact MSCs, while the reverse effect was observed in osteocommitted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
                <p>It should be noted that the MMP3 level decreased in osteocommitted MSCs, but simulated microgravity led to enhanced secretion of this protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f008">Figure 8</xref>).

                <p>After 10 days of RPM exposure, the expression of 84 genes associated with adhesion and matrix production was analyzed. This gene profiler included cell adhesion molecules (transmembrane receptors, cell–cell adhesion, cell–ECM adhesion, other cell adhesion molecules) and ECM molecules (basement membrane constituents, collagens and ECM structural constituents, ECM proteases, ECM protease inhibitors, other ECM molecules). Some low/non-expressed genes were excluded from analysis, and the relative expression of others is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-05428-f009">Figure 9</xref>).

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>The 10-day RPM exposure of MSCs (intact and osteocommitted) did not cause significant changes in morphology, immunophenotype, and cell viability. It should be mentioned that CD90, CD73, and CD105 expression decreased after osteocommittment. At the same time, the 10 days of SMG did not shift these expression patterns. It is known that integrins α2 and aV/β3 are involved in osteogenic differentiation, mediating signaling of MAPK and PI3K kinases that are required for the activation of master osteogenesis regulator runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) [<xref rid="B43-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The decreased expression of these molecules may be compensatory negative feedback to osteogenic stimulation. A similar effect has been previously demonstrated [<xref rid="B45-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The important role of CD90 and CD73 in osteo-differentiation was demonstrated in vivo since relevant knockout mice exhibit signs of osteopenia phenotype [<xref rid="B46-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p>
              <p>We observed the reduced level of collagenous proteins in MCS ECM after 10 days of SMG. Preliminary osteocommitment partly prevented the reduction in collagen content under SMG but did not eliminate the attenuation of collagens in the ECM in comparison with static control. Decrease of collagen production was demonstrated during exposure cultured MSCs to SMG and osteogenic stimuli [<xref rid="B48-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These fibers constitute up to 90% of bone organics and determine the strength of tissues and mechanical resistance to stretching. ECM collagen fibers stimulate MSC osteogenesis due to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling via integrins containing the β1 subunit [<xref rid="B49-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Reduced collagen production by MSCs may cause the decrease in osteogenesis and contribute to the development of osteopenia during spaceflights.</p>
              <p>The experimental results concerning gene expression in osteogenic precursors supported the possibility of decreased collagen production under microgravity. For example, 2–7-day exposure aboard SJ-10 satellite caused a downregulation in several collagen genes in bone marrow MSCs stimulated to undergo osteogenic differentiation [<xref rid="B50-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A similar effect was revealed after 7 days of RPM exposure of osteoblasts [<xref rid="B51-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. COL1A1 expression as well as that of a number of other markers of osteogenic differentiation were downregulated in two types of cell lines during cultivation on board of ISS for 14 days [<xref rid="B52-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It should be mentioned that under gravitational unloading, along with other signs of the bone imbalance, inhibition of collagen production was shown [<xref rid="B53-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p>
              <p>Simultaneously with a decrease in collagen level, we observed an increase of proteoglycans in the ECM after 10 days of SMG. These changes in ECM components can enhance its regulatory role because the deposition of VEGF, IGF, FGF, and other growth factors [<xref rid="B55-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It can be assumed that a similar effect in vivo will result in the decomposition of proteoglycans accumulated during spaceflight and the release of growth factors after returning to normal gravity. It has been shown that proteoglycan overage in bone tissue occurs in some types of osteogenesis imperfecta and makes mineralization difficult [<xref rid="B4-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Analysis of MSC transcriptomic profiles revealed moderate changes in different groups of ECM-associated genes. Among the 16 ITG genes, only ITGA3 and ITGB1 were altered after 10 days of SMG. It should be mentioned that short-term SMG caused impaired cell adhesion in vitro and transcriptomic shifts of adhesion molecules [<xref rid="B42-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It is known that each of the integrin subunits is encoded by an individual gene and, therefore, decreased expression of one integrin subunit can attenuate the cell–matrix interaction. Subunits α5 and β1 associate to form fibronectin receptors, while α3 and β1 form laminin receptors [<xref rid="B57-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Downregulation of α3 and α5 subunits may result in reduced numbers of laminin and fibronectin receptors and, therefore, in a decrease in the adhesion of osteocommitted MSCs. The attenuation of adhesion in intact MSCs may be due to an upregulation of TNC, since an excess of tenascin has been shown to attenuate cell adhesion to fibronectin. In addition, the interaction of tenascin with fibronectin stimulated the expression of a number of protease genes [<xref rid="B58-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p>
              <p>Moreover, the α3 subunit is responsible for activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and is associated with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [<xref rid="B60-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. At the same time, the β1 subunit is associated with MAPK signaling [<xref rid="B40-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These signaling pathways are involved in osteogenic differentiation. It is possible that the integrin-mediated effect on these pathways could be compensated. A similar result was obtained after evaluation of the expression of anchor proteins (catenins) associated with adhesion. CTNNB1 expression was upregulated in osteocommitted MSCs, while CTNND1 was upregulated in intact cells after 10 days of SMG.</p>
              <p>ECM remodeling comprises several simultaneous processes, including synthesis and degradation of different macromolecules. In our work, it was shown that intact and osteocommitted MSCs altered protease production in a similar way to under simulated microgravity. In both cases, an increase in cathepsin A, cathepsin D, and MMP3 secretion was detected. In addition, the level of MMP2 secretion increased in intact MSCs, while it decreased in osteo-MSC. This could be the reason for a lower decrease in collagenous proteins in osteo-MSCs. The activation of protease secretion under microgravity can lead to increased proteolysis and be one of bone resorption factors in vivo. MMP1 breaks down collagen types I, II, and III. MMP2 is specifically active against collagen IV, a major component of basal membranes. MMP3 is involved in the degradation of collagen types II, III, IV, IX, and X, proteoglycans, and fibronectin. This enzyme can also act as an activator of MMP1, MMP7, and MMP9, which makes it an important participant in connective tissue remodeling [<xref rid="B62-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A similar upregulation of MMP1 and MMP3 in fibroblasts during 3-day SMG was shown by Buken et al. [<xref rid="B37-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>
              <p>Cathepsins are lysosomal proteases, most of which have maximal activity at low pH. The degradation of intracellular proteins, hormones, and growth factors, and the regulation of apoptosis are the main physiological functions of cathepsin D. In addition, cathepsins are able to activate proteases. Cathepsin A is involved in hydrolysis of sialic acid in glycoproteins, thus playing a role in their degradation [<xref rid="B64-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This may be especially important for the production of bone sialoprotein, involved in bone ECM mineralization. The study after 15-day spaceflight also demonstrated an upregulation of MMP1, MMP3, and MMP10 in the murine bone marrow MSCs, which indicated an activation of bone resorption and suggested the involvement of progenitor cells [<xref rid="B10-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>The family of metallopeptidase inhibitors (TIMP) is one of the important components for regulation of ECM degradation. In intact MSCs, the expression of TIMP1 and TIMP3 were downregulated after 10 days of SMG, which suggests the probable increased activity of MMPs. It is known that TIMP3 inhibits a wide range of matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP9, MMP13, MMP14, and MMP15 [<xref rid="B65-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The effect of protease inhibitor reduction can be assumed to prevail due to the fact that each of them is capable of inhibiting more than one MMP. This is also indicated by a decrease in MSC collagenous proteins under SMG, since MMPs do respond for the proteolysis of collagens. It should be mentioned that in osteo-MSCs, the TIMP3 expression decreased is less pronounced under SMG. This may explain ECM collagen maintenance in these cells versus intact MSCs.</p>
              <p>RPM exposure for 10 days induces MSC transcriptomic changes, which can lead to a weakening of adhesion to the matrix and slowdown in osteogenic differentiation. An upregulation of TNC expression after RPM exposure should be noted. Similar effects were observed in other experimental studies [<xref rid="B66-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This is of particular interest since an excess of tenascin weakens cell adhesion to fibronectin [<xref rid="B58-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Gene expression changes which can negatively affect cell adhesion under 96 h RPM exposure were shown [<xref rid="B34-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. After 10-day exposure, we did not find significant changes in the expression of molecules responsible for cell adhesion. Upregulation of TNC in MSCs under microgravity could activate matrix protease production, since it was shown that the interaction of tenascin with fibronectin stimulates the gene expression of proteases [<xref rid="B59-ijms-22-05428" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Apparently, there is a relationship between tenascin, protease expression, and cell adhesion under microgravity, and this issue requires further study.</p>
              <p>Thus, after 10 days of SMG, the activation of ECM proteolytic processes was more pronounced in intact MSCs in comparison with osteocommited progeny. This is possible due to the downregulation of protease inhibitor encoding genes and increased secretion of MMPs. In addition, a 10-day RPM exposure provoked transcriptomic changes that can subsequently result in attenuated cell adhesion to the matrix. In the case of osteocommitted MSCs, this may happen due to a downregulation in integrin subunit genes, while in intact MSCs, it may occur due to an upregulation of tenascin. The attenuated adhesion to collagens may also be the reason for the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation via MAPK signaling. Thus, mesenchymal stromal cells of different commitment would differently contribute to the ECM degradation process of bone tissue during spaceflight. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to support and extend the above findings.</p>
