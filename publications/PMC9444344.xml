                <title>SUMMARY</title>
                <p id="P5">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Twins Study created an integrative molecular profile of an astronaut during NASAâs first 1-year mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and included comparisons to an identical Earth-bound twin. The unique biochemical profiles observed when landing on Earth after such a long mission (e.g., spikes in interleukin-1 [IL-1]/6/10, c-reactive protein [CRP], C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 [CCL2], IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra], and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-Î±]) opened new questions about the human bodyâs response to gravity and how to plan for future astronauts, particularly around initiation or resolution of inflammation. Here, single-cell, multi-omic (100-plex epitope profile and gene expression) profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed changes to blood cell composition and gene expression post-flight, specifically for monocytes and dendritic cell precursors. These were consistent with flight-induced cytokine and immune system stress, followed by skeletal muscle regeneration in response to gravity. Finally, we examined these profiles relative to 6-month missions in 28 other astronauts and detail potential pharmacological interventions for returning to gravity in future missions.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P8">Landing on a planet after transit in space is a complex event for the human body, leading to a broad range of physiological and psychological stressors. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Twins Study (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>) resulted in the first-ever multi-omic profile of an astronaut after almost a year (340 days) on the International Space Station (ISS), while leveraging a comparison to his monozygotic Earth-bound twin. More than 300 samples were collected across 19 time points before, during, and after spaceflight, and data were generated across myriad modalities of human and microbial biology, including isolations of stool, saliva, skin, urine, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and immune cells that were CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and CD19<sup>+</sup> enriched and lymphocyte depleted (LD). The study used a wide battery of methods: short-read and long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), RNA sequencing (poly(A), ribo-, microRNA [miRNA]), shotgun metagenome sequencing, 16S rRNA sequencing, targeted proteomics (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [LC-MS]), untargeted proteomics (PECAN, MaxQuant), targeted metabolomics (gas chromatography [GC]-MS), mitochondrial respiration (SeaHorse), oxidative state (electron paramagnetic resonance [EPR]), T cell and B cell receptor (TCR/BCR) profiling, cognition tests, vascular measures, and health biometrics (nutrition, height, weight) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>). Previous results identified a significant increase upon landing of five markers: interleukin-6 (IL-6), c-reactive protein (CRP), IL-10, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP1]), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), which is followed immediately by a decrease in markers that were elevated during flight. These included tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), IL-1Î±, and IL-1Î², which are normally associated with immune dysregulation but are also involved in bone metabolism and early stages of muscle regeneration.</p>
              <p id="P9">To narrow down the roles that these inflammatory proteins and epitopes play during landing, we considered gravity as one of the most prominent changes to affect flight subject (TW) on landing, although we cannot disregard other factors (e.g., environment). Based on previous studies performed on astronauts following 6-month missions, it was determined that in-flight countermeasures were insufficient to fully replicate or replace the daily mechanical loading exerted by gravity (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Genc et al., 2010</xref>), which resulted in decreased muscle volume and strength, particularly in the lower extremities (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Akima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">Trappe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Korth, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2020b</xref>). Moreover, muscle and bone deterioration are time-dependent processes (<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Winnard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, reintroduction to Earthâs gravity after a year of weightlessness would likely cause greater reloading injury and inflammation during muscle regeneration and growth than might be seen after 6 months in space (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Fitts et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Stein, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Smith, 2018</xref>). The thorough biochemical profiling performed in the Twins Study has captured this post-landing phenomenon (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P10">Here, we generated single-cell, multi-omic (protein and RNA) data from the twin astronauts (TW and ground subject [HR]) and examined in greater detail the unique biochemical profiles expressed upon return to unit gravity (1g). Single-cell epitope and expression analysis of peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) showed elevated levels of classical monocytes (CD14<sup>+</sup>, CD16<sup>â</sup>, pro-inflammatory) on landing compared with pre-flight values, which proceeded to decrease post-flight as non-classical monocytes (CD14<sup>â</sup>, CD16<sup>+</sup>, anti-inflammatory) increased. Many of these proteins are pleiotropic, exerting many functions throughout the body, and they are often associated with initiation or resolution of detrimental inflammatory responses. In light of the self-reported flu-like symptoms, skin inflammation, and discomfort experienced by TW on landing, the question arises as to whether such symptoms should be treated pharmacologically to attenuate them for future missions; and if so, how? In this analysis, we describe the major effects and interactions of these proteins with respect to the process of muscle regeneration as well as examine possible pharmacological interventions for future astronauts.</p>

                <title>Biochemical Response to Landing on Earth</title>
                <p id="P11">Biochemical profiling of the flight subject TW revealed a clear molecular signature in response to his return to 1g (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), most notably for the samples collected on day zero (R0) at Johnson Space Center (JSC) crew quarters, ~24 h after de-orbit. During this time, TW engaged in some ambulatory activities, but slept for the greater part of the journey from Kazakhstan to JSC. A second set of samples was then collected on R+5 (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>). The cytokines depicted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> showed relatively stable levels in TW, with a significant spike immediately after landing, with increases at R0 and R+5 in IL-6 (100%), CRP (1,150%), IL-10 (4%), CCL2/MCP1 (475%), and IL-1ra (1,500%), compared to pre-flight means (ANOVA, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>). These cytokines are normally associated with inflammatory immune responses, and by R+60, all biochemical markers had returned to pre-flight levels. These cytokines are also associated with muscle regeneration and indicate a physiological response to muscle exertion in the presence of gravity as opposed to a purely detrimental inflammatory response.</p>
                <p id="P12">Interestingly, these changes are consistent with changes in other astronauts after shorter (up to 6-month-duration) missions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Crucian et al., 2014</xref>). IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, and IL-1ra all showed major increases upon landing compared with pre-flight median levels for each astronaut, although TW showed a more pronounced elevation of these markers after his 12-month mission than the set of 28 astronauts returning from 6-month missions. It should be noted that the IL-6 and IL-10 results for TW were below the assay detection limits for pre-flight and post-flight samples but close to the upper limit of detection for the return time point in the comparable assay plotted in <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>, making absolute quantification difficult.</p>

                <title>Pathway Interactions Driving Muscle Regeneration</title>
                <p id="P13">The prominent cytokines in the landing signatures map to known mechanistic relationships and biological pathways involved in muscle regeneration (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). IL-6 is at the center of these different pathways and holds the most connections to the other markers. Of note, IL-6 has two signaling pathways: trans-signaling and classic signaling (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Scheller et al., 2011</xref>). The former is associated with a pro-inflammatory response (e.g., increases in IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±) and the latter is associated with the anti-inflammatory functions of exercise and homeostasis (e.g., inhibitory effect on TNF-Î± and IL-1) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Scheller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Del Giudice and Gangestad, 2018</xref>). Given this relationship, the data from TW and other astronauts suggest that IL-6 is following a trans-signaling pathway while in flight, since it is elevated along with TNF-Î± and IL-1(Î± and Î²) (ANOVA, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>). However, at R0, IL-6 increased 100%, while TNF-Î± and IL-1 decreased sharply between R0 and R+5. IL-10 and IL-1ra also increased at R0 (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>), as is predicted by the known pathways of muscle regeneration. Taking these combined interactions into consideration, the R0 and R+5 biochemical data from TW suggest that IL-6 mechanism changes upon landing, switching to function through the classical signaling pathway in response to increased muscle loading and gravity.</p>

                <title>In-Flight Marker Shifts</title>
                <p id="P14">A broad range of biochemical markers were elevated during flight and decreased significantly on return (ANOVA, <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>). Although many of these are involved in mediating inflammation, cell growth, and cell prolifer ation, as well as tumor proliferation and vascularization (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>), they are also involved in musculoskeletal pathways. Most notably, these include inflammatory, osteoclastogenic cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², IL-8) (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Amarasekara et al., 2018</xref>) and chemokines (CCL5, CCL3) (<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">Yano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Vallet et al., 2011</xref>), which are involved in osteoclast activation and osteoblast inhibition as well as muscle atrophy. Important mediators include growth factors (fibroblast growth factor [FGF] basic, granulocyte colony stimulating factor [GCSF], granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Nagaraju et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kuwabara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Charoenlarp et al., 2017</xref>), which are associated not only with processes of muscle differentiation and regeneration but also with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and inflammation. As with the cytokines elevated in response to landing, the profiles of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², IL-8, CCL5, and GCSF are similar to those measured in other astronauts (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>). Again, these measured effects are not as pronounced for the astronauts returning from shorter flights compared with TW. This would appear to be a result of these markers not becoming as elevated during the shorter flight. Urinary bone resorption markers that also decreased include urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), urinary C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide (CTX), and urinary N-terminal telopeptide (NTX), among others (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019</xref>). The decrease of these markers immediately following the rise of markers associated with muscle regeneration (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), further support the suggested interpretation of the landing signatures as a progression from muscular atrophy, inflammation, and bone resorption during flight to muscle regeneration and bone anabolism upon landing.</p>

                <title>Single-Cell Epitope and Expression Analysis</title>
                <p id="P15">Immune cell types were also profiled at the epitope and gene expression levels to discern the impact of spaceflight on cellular composition. Time points include pre-flight, landing, and post-flight data; there is no in-flight data available for single-cell analysis. Clusters were identified through projection of both RNA and epitope expression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>). Composition analysis was done after removal of T and B cell populations, as the samples were CD4, CD8, and CD19 depleted (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Although the composition of immune cell populations seemed to be impacted both on landing and during post-landing recovery, these values were not out of the range observed in the matching ground samples. The monocyte population seemed to be most affected in terms of composition, with a large increase in the number of classical monocytes compared with the other profiled cell populations on the day TW returned to Earth. This is supported by the number of cells at day R0 expressing high levels CD14 compared with CD16 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D</xref>â<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). By days 36 and 191 post-flight, the numbers of classical monocytes decreased back to levels similar to the measured pre-flight values, and the ratio of CD14 and CD16 high expressing cells is more similar to the pre-flight time points. By contrast, the circulating monocyte-dendritic cell precursor (MDP) and progenitor populations do increase post-flight; this is supported by an increase in the expression of CD34 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>). There was also an increase in CD274, a marker of monocyte activation, at days 36 and 191 post-flight (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4J</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4K</xref>). Additionally, the expression of CD14 mRNA and CD14 epitope was compared to determine which cells were likely new classical monocytes. Cells were defined to be new classical monocytes if their scaled CD14 mRNA expression was greater than 1, while their scaled CD14 epitope expression was less than 1 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4L</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4M</xref>). The proportion of new classical monocytes to the total monocyte population was then determined for each time point (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4N</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4O</xref>). The increase in new monocytes in the post-flight time points is consistent with the increase in circulating MDP and progenitor cells.</p>
                <p id="P16">In addition to the holistic composition analysis, we determined expression of select genes in pathways related to the measured biochemical response to landing in the monocyte-related population at each time point, including IL-6, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TNFR2, non-canonical nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), and GM-CSF (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Cells were grouped by day into pre-flight (where L is days before launch, L-462, L-448, L-414, L-371 for TW and GD-366 for HR), landing (where R us days post return, R0 for TW and GD+3 for HR), and post-flight (R+36, R+191 for TW and GD+66 for HR) and tested to determine whether the changes in expression were significant for these signatures by Wilcoxon rank-sum test in a pairwise fashion (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). IL-6 pathways are most affected in the classical monocyte population, where we see statistically significant differences (all adjusted p values &lt; 9.33Eâ14) between pre-flight, landing, and post-flight expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>), with an increase at R0 compared with pre-flight and subsequent decrease post-flight. MDPs and intermediate and non-classical monocytes also show significant differences between landing and post-flight measurements as well as between pre-flight and post-flight, with decreases in post-flight values compared with landing and pre-flight (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P17">The TNFR1 and TNFR2 non-canonical NF-ÎºB pathways were also affected. TNFR1 showed statistically significant differences between landing and post-flight measurements for MDPs and classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes, with decreases in post-landing values compared with landing and pre-flight values (all <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &lt; 0.01) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Similar to IL-6, TNFR2 was also most affected in its classical monocyte population, although appearing to have an almost inverse relationship with IL-6 in its pre-flight, landing, and post-flight responses. TNFR2 shows a decrease in expression at R0 compared to pre-flight and subsequent increase post-flight. MDPs and intermediate monocytes also show significant differences between landing and post-flight measurements, as well as between pre-flight and post-flight measurements, with increases in post-flight values compared with landing and pre-flight values.</p>
                <p id="P18">Given the rapid dynamics of the MDPs and other immune precursor populations, we then compared the response to the GM-CSF-associated cells between the pre-flight and landing samples. These data showed that the only population with a significant increase in expression is in the progenitor cells (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). By contrast, when comparing the post-flight samples to either the pre-flight or landing samples, we see significant increases in expression within the classical and intermediate monocytes, as well as the neutrophils. The post-flight progenitor cells also had significantly increased expression compared with the pre-flight samples, but not the landing samples. The increase in GM-CSF response in the circulating progenitor cells at R0 correlates with the increase in their proportion of PBMCs. At R+36 and R+191, the classical and intermediate monocytes had elevated levels of GM-CSF pathway genes. This indicates a general expansion of the monocyte population, as evidenced by the increase in the new classical monocyte population. GM-CSF alone does not influence polarization of the monocytes, which is evidenced by an increase in new classical monocytes being accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of classical-to-non-classical monocytes, consistent with initiation of skeletal muscle repair (<xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Wicks and Roberts, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

                <title>Cytokine Shifts Mediating Inflammation, Muscle Regeneration, and Bone Anabolism</title>
                <p id="P19">The biochemical profiling and single-cell analysis taken together suggest mechanisms involved in a physiological response to muscle regeneration and bone anabolism on landing. Muscle unloading conditions occurred concomitantly with the elevation of biomarkers associated with bone resorption, muscle atrophy, and regeneration during flight in TW. Soon after returning to 1g, muscle activation likely initiated cascades driven by the large increase of muscle-derived IL-6, comparable with signal cascades involving the same pathways and cytokines in studies involving intense exercise. While there are many factors influencing the changes in expression of the measured cytokines, muscle is the largest internal organ with autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine functions and is therefore most likely to be among the greatest contributors to the biochemical changes observed in TW (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Hamrick, 2011</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P20">It is well established that muscle and bone mass are closely linked across growth, development, and aging on Earth. Spaceflight has been shown to cause skeletal muscle atrophy as a result of mechanical unloading, in spite of heavy resistive exercise regimens (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Fitts et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Brooks and Myburgh, 2014</xref>). Ground-based studies have also demonstrated that muscle atrophy is associated with bone loss and conversely, mechanical stimuli from muscle with bone anabolism and osteogenesis (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Hamrick, 2011</xref>). These ground studies suggest that an increase of bone resorption markers in the flight data may be linked to muscle unloading (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al., 2020</xref>) and atrophy, although more flight studies would be needed. The elevated in-flight markers include osteoclastogenic cytokines TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-1Î±, among others, all of which also drive muscle wasting in chronic inflammatory conditions (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Hu, 2018</xref>). Moreover, all the osteoclastogenic cytokines and chemokines, as well as the elevated bone resorption markers shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, decrease significantly immediately after landing, following an ~100-fold increase in IL-6, again likely due to increased muscle loading. Noting that although loads such as standing and walking may not have been high, they were novel in comparison with spaceflight, both by using muscles not applied during exercise countermeasures and by having a higher cumulative load throughout the day.</p>

                <title>Parallels between Pathogenic Immune Response and Muscle Regeneration</title>
                <p id="P21">Under normal weight-bearing conditions, muscle regeneration during acute injury due to exercise can be divided into three major time-dependent phases that parallel an immune response to pathogens: the first and second phases are pro-inflammatory and the third phase is anti-inflammatory (<xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Hu, 2018</xref>). In the first phase, pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-Î± and IL-1 are released to promote requisite inflammation to the affected muscle tissue (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Gordon and Galli, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Gorospe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Radley and Grounds, 2006</xref>). The second phase involves the conversion of monocytes to classically activated, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and the recruitment of T cells, which also express and maintain large amounts of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î². The third phase is marked by the switch from pro-inflammatory M1-type to anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophages, which produce IL-10 to suppress the local inflammatory response and promote regeneration (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Stout and Suttles, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Hu, 2018</xref>). In the case of atrophy from non-use, however, mouse studies have indicated that unloading conditions such as spaceflight can inhibit or delay skeletal muscle regeneration by interfering with the recruitment of macrophages and abnormally persistent neutrophils (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Kohno et al., 2012</xref>). The phenotype is thus predominantly driven by pro-inflammatory M1-type macrophages that are high in expression of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², leading to prolonged inflammation and incomplete muscle regeneration (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Kohno et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P22">The elevated in-flight levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1(Î² and Î±), along with the lack of IL-10 elevation in the biochemical data, suggest that while all three stages of muscle regeneration may be present during flight as a result of daily exercise, the first two pro-inflammatory stages appear to predominate over the third anti-inflammatory stage. On landing, the regeneration process progresses to the final, anti-inflammatory phase of regeneration as is supported by the increase of IL-10 and IL-1ra as well as the simultaneous decrease of TNF-Î± and IL-1(Î² and Î±).</p>

                <title>Shifts in Monocyte Populations and Select Gene Pathways Suggest Muscle Regeneration</title>
                <p id="P23">The single-cell data show a significant increase in the classical monocyte population at R0 compared with the pre-flight samples. Since there are no in-flight data available, it is unknown whether this population was elevated prior to landing. However, this might be the case as this would be consistent with chronic inflammation. Moreover, the change observed in the post-landing single-cell data, showing a progressive decrease in the classical monocyte population (M1 progenitor) and a progressive increase in non-classical (M2 progenitor) monocytes, supports the biochemical data that suggest a disrupted regeneration process in-flight. The decline in the post-landing neutrophil population may be indicative of change in the state of persistence in muscle, or re-acclimation to the terrestrial environment (and microbiome) (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018</xref>), but it is difficult to say without knowing inflight values (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Castro-Wallace et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">McIntyre et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of select gene pathways further supports this interpretation, particularly in the apparent near-inverse relationship between IL-6 and TNFR2, mainly in the classical monocyte population.

                <title>Pharmacological Interventions</title>
                <p id="P24">Insights from the multi-omics data generated in the NASA Twins Study and the comprehensive biochemical profiling analyzed can potentially translate into targeted pharmacotherapies for astronauts to ameliorate symptoms experienced on return to Earth. However, these must be weighed carefully, as many potential interventions would impair muscle regeneration. Here, we review some of the pharmacological measures specific to different cytokines and chemokines with significant shifts in TWâs return, which are also summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
                <p id="P25">Of the five cytokines that spiked on landing, only two appear to be good candidates for pharmacological intervention: IL-6 and IL-1ra. IL-6 is at the center of the pathways involving muscle regeneration, which would make it an ideal target for pharmacological manipulation. However, global inhibition of IL-6 can result in impaired muscle growth (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Scheller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Hoene et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">MuÃ±oz-CÃ¡noves et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, selective inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling is possible using soluble gp130 (sgp130) to bind the IL-6/soluble IL-R6 (sIL-6R) complex in circulation (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, studies suggest that classic signaling may mediate beneficial effects on bone repair and that selective inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling may have therapeutic potential (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Scheller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>). As opposed to selective inhibition of trans-signaling, in-flight enhancement of IL-6 is another possibility. Although IL-6 is already slightly elevated in-flight, the source of IL-6 is dictating an inflammatory, trans-signaling pathway as is supported by the elevated levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1. In studies of IL-6 enhancement, recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) infusion inhibited levels of TNF-Î± similarly to the effects of exercise, or increased production of IL-1ra and IL-10 without increasing TNF-Î± (<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Starkie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Steensberg et al., 2013</xref>). These provide potential options for control of the inflammatory downstream effects of IL-6 trans-signaling while in flight, although not necessarily on landing since there is already an abundance of muscle-derived IL-6. Enhancement of IL-1ra may be a strategy better suited for landing. IL-1ra is involved in the resolution of inflammation in skeletal muscle repair after exercise by blocking IL-1 inflammatory pathways as well as IL-6 trans-signaling without affecting muscle-generated IL-6 (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Nordmann et al., 2015</xref>). A clinical trial by <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Nordmann et al. (2015)</xref> found that IL-1 antagonism with a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of the human IL-1ra (anakinra) improved glycemia and decreased systemic inflammation including trans-signaling of IL-6 without affecting muscle-derived IL-6, which is independent of IL-1 signaling.</p>
                <p id="P26">Inhibition of CRP on landing may be unfavorable for muscle regeneration and must be considered carefully. Like IL-6, CRP has pro- and anti-inflammatory roles in many processes related to inflammation and tissue maintenance (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Del Giudice and Gangestad, 2018</xref>). In the absence of inflammation, CRP production is stimulated by IL-6 via classic signaling. Through this pathway, CRP is acting in an anti-inflammatory role by stimulating the release of IL-10 and IL-1ra, contributing to tissue repair and clearance of damaged cells, as well as resolving inflammation by inducing the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in macrophages, which promotes tissue repair and wound healing (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Del Giudice and Gangestad, 2018</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P27">Although CCL2 is often a pharmacological target for inflammation, it plays an essential role inducing a requisite inflammatory response to repair and regenerate skeletal muscle (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Deshmane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Human clinical trials in most investigational drugs that target CCL2/CCR2 signaling have failed except for plozalizumab (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert et al., 2011</xref>). Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine medication, has been found to inhibit IL-1Î±-elicited CCL2 production without inhibiting IL-8 production (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Oda et al., 2002</xref>). However, in the case of returning astronauts, any attempts to reduce CCL2 production or reduce CCR2 expression would need to be carefully weighed, since poor muscle regeneration may be a significant side effect of this line of therapy and would not be warranted to treat an acute and temporary elevation of CCL2 (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P28">Enhancement of IL-10 would initially seem a plausible avenue, since IL-10 plays a central role in regulating the switch of macrophages from the inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype in injured muscle, as well as inhibiting the production of inflammatory IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², GCSF, and GM-CSF (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Londhe and Guttridge, 2015</xref>). However, clinical studies find that IL-10 supplementation mainly benefits subjects who have endogenously lower expression of IL-10 and who have active disease states (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Marlow et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, although IL-10 is required for normal growth and regeneration of injured muscle, there appears to be a dose-dependent effect, and supraphysiological levels may slow the growth of regenerative fibers (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lauw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Perdiguero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, use of IL-10 must also be carefully considered.</p>
                <p id="P29">In conclusion, these data indicate that the severity of the human bodyâs response to returning to gravity is somewhat dependent on the length of time an astronaut spends in space. While these findings are striking, and the suggested countermeasures plausible, it must be cautioned that these are results of an n = 2 study, plus a small confirmatory cohort of 28 astronauts. More data for longer missions need to be collected to prepare for long-duration Martian missions (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Nangle et al., 2020</xref>), including new, dynamic measures from blood and serum such as cell-free nucleic acids and exomes (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Bezdan, 2020</xref>), miRNAs (Malkani, 2020), telomere dynamics (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Luxton, 2020</xref>), and mitochondrial stress (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Silveira, 2020</xref>). Also, while some of these biochemical and genetic signatures are recurrent, not every astronaut will exhibit the same biochemical profile shifts or respond the same way to the same medical interventions (<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">Vernice et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, such variability is the basis for the field of pharmacogenomics, and personalized approaches to aerospace medicine are now emerging (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Iosim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt et al., 2020</xref>). This catalog of biomarkers, their targets, and methods for pharmacological manipulation can help guide future work and understanding of the bodyâs adaptations to ânormalâ gravity when returning to Earth (1g), or eventually the less strenuous gravity of the moon (16%) or Mars (38%).</p>

                  <p id="P36">An LC-MS/MS based targeted proteomic approach was applied to assess 24 h pooled urine samples targeting a panel of 20 proteins which are found detectable in urine samples derived from healthy subjects and individuals with pathological conditions: podocalyxin (PODXL), renin receptor (RENR), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UROK), pro-epidermal growth factor (EGF), Collagen alpha-1(I) chain (CO1A1), Collagen alpha-1(III) chain (CO3A1), Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), Cathepsin D (CATD), Matrilysin (MMP7), Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IBP3), Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IBP2), Vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1), Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), Syndecan-4 (SDC4), Aquaporin-2 (AQP2), Selenoprotein P (SEPP1), Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (UPAR), Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IBP7), Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), Cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase (CNDP2). Urine (0.2 mL) was supplemented with 1 Î¼g of Î±-amylase from <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus oryzea</italic>, which helps provide bulk protein to optimize protein precipitation and helps control for the variability in digestion from sample to sample. Ice-cold acidified methanol:acetone 50%:50% (v:v, 0.8 mL) was used to precipitate proteins for 24 h at â20Â°C. Precipitated proteins are dried under vacuum and then reconstituted in 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were reduced in 5 mM dithiothreitol for 1 h at 60Â°C, alkylated in 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and then digested with 1 Î¼g trypsin (Worthington Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) for 2 h at 37Â°C with shaking (Thermomixer, 1400 rpm). Deoxycholate was precipitated by the addition of HCl (final concentration of 200 mM), which was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was desalted using solid phase extraction (HLB mElute plate, Waters, Milford, MA). The eluted peptides were dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid, which was then spiked with internal standard peptides. Proteins of interest were quantified using LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to an Easy-nLC liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Selected peptides from the proteins of interest were monitored by selecting their precursor ions in the isolation quadrupole (selection window 1.5 Da) and full scan MS/ MS after HCD fragmentation (NCE 27) in the Orbitrap analyzer using the lowest resolution (17,500) setting to increase scan rate. Scheduled acquisition with five-minute acquisition windows were set up for each peptide precursor using Skyline software (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">MacLean et al., 2010</xref>), allowing a maximum of 30 concurrent PRM experiments at any given time. Acquired data were then processed in Skyline, and automated integration was 10 manually checked for each peptide chromatogram.</p>

Analysis using the data independent acquisition was performed in two steps. A chromatogram library, peptide and, protein identification, and spectral library was performed with narrow mass window selection for the MS/MS (2 m/z) on a pooled sample. The study samples were analyzed with a wider mass window selection for MS/MS (10 m/z).

                  <p id="P45">After log-transformation and scaling by median count, linear models were fit to the data. The false discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated using the âp.adjustâ function in R. Cytokines were considered discriminant when the adjusted p value was below 0.05.</p>

                  <title>Analysis of scRNA and epitope sequencing from NASA Twins Study Samples</title>
                  <p id="P46">Fastq files were uploaded to Seven Bridges Genomics. Data were demultiplexed and sequences analyzed with BDâs Rhapsody pipeline (BD Rhapsody Analysis Pipeline 1.4 Beta) on Seven Bridges (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sevenbridges.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sevenbridges.com/</ext-link>). This generated a sparse matrix file of features by barcodes. This sparse matrix data were then read into R using the R package Seurat 3.2.0 (<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>), and standard quality control was run to remove cells with few genes or likely doublets. Data were then scaled and normalized. Linear dimensional reduction was performed by calculation of PCA from the most variable genes. Cells were then clustered using a resolution value of 0.5 and visualized by UMAP. Module scores were calculated using the AddModuleScore function with a control value of 5. Individual genes and module scores were projected and used to identify appropriate classification of clusters. Clusters were assigned to cell populations based on gene markers. Significance in module scores between cell populations calculated by Wilcoxon rank sum and corrected by Benjamini Hochberg (5% FDR).</p>
