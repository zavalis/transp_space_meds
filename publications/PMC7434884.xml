                <p id="Par1">Historically, International Space Station (ISS) exercise countermeasures have not fully protected astronauts’ musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory fitness. Although these losses have been reduced on more recent missions, decreasing the time required to perform in-flight exercise would permit reallocation of that time to other tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of a new training prescription, ISS crewmembers performed either the high intensity/lower volume integrated Sprint resistance (3 d wk<sup>−1</sup>) and aerobic (interval and continuous workouts, each 3 d wk<sup>−1</sup> in alternating fashion) exercise program (<italic>n</italic> = 9: 8M/1F, 48 ± 7 y, 178 ± 5 cm, 77.7 ± 12.0 kg) or the standard ISS countermeasure consisting of daily resistance and aerobic exercise (<italic>n</italic> = 17: 14M/3F, 46 ± 6 y, 176 ± 6 cm, 80.6 ± 10.5 kg) during long-duration spaceflight. Bone mineral density (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)), muscle strength (isokinetic dynamometry), muscle function (cone agility test), and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) were assessed pre- and postflight. Mixed-effects modeling was used to analyze dependent measures with alpha set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. After spaceflight, femoral neck bone mineral density (−1.7%), knee extensor peak torque (−5.8%), cone agility test time (+7.4%), and VO<sub>2peak</sub> (−6.1%) were decreased in both groups (simple main effects of time, all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with a few group × time interaction effects detected for which Sprint experienced either attenuated or no loss compared to control. Although physiologic outcomes were not appreciably different between the two exercise programs, to conserve time and optimally prepare crewmembers for the performance of physically demanding mission tasks, high intensity/lower volume training should be an indispensable component of spaceflight exercise countermeasure prescriptions.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Exercise countermeasures are employed during spaceflight to combat the deleterious physiologic effects of long-duration microgravity exposure. Early exercise hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) was limited to low running velocities (treadmill with vibration isolation system, TVIS: ~11.3 km h<sup>−1</sup> peak permitted velocity) and low loads (interim resistive exercise device, iRED: 136 kg peak load), making a low intensity/high volume exercise program the default prescription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Despite the near-daily performance of this program, multisystem deconditioning was evident including decrements in muscle mass, strength, and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, cardiorespiratory fitness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and bone mineral density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The effectiveness of high intensity/low volume training (HIT) has been extensively documented in populations ranging from elite athletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> to clinical patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition to the time savings of shorter exercise sessions, there is evidence to suggest that HIT may elicit superior physiologic adaptations compared to traditional lower intensity/higher volume training. For instance, over a 6-week period (5 d wk<sup>−1</sup>), Tabata et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> compared 60 min bouts of continuous exercise (70% VO<sub>2peak</sub>) to 7–8 intervals (20 s at 170% VO<sub>2peak</sub>/10 s rest). Despite cumulative exercise time of only ~2 h compared to 30 h for the continuous group, the HIT group increased both aerobic and anaerobic capacity whereas the continuous, high volume group only improved aerobic capacity. Somewhat longer-duration intervals of 2–4 min have been shown to maintain or improve aerobic capacity during bed rest unloading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and athletic training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. High intensity training also has been employed in resistance exercise and elicits superior increases in muscle mass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and strength compared to lower intensities with equivalent volume load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">To facilitate higher intensity aerobic and resistance exercise, the original suite of ISS exercise hardware was replaced in 2009 with a second-generation treadmill (T2: 19.3 km h<sup>−1</sup> peak velocity) and the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED: 272 kg peak load)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, power issues initially limited T2’s peak velocity to 14.5 km h<sup>−1</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and although crewmembers could lift heavier loads on ARED (up to 6-repetition maximum loads have been used based on crewmember capability and preference)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, they continued to perform both aerobic and resistance exercise 6 days per week. This approach consumed 9–10 h per week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, a significant time commitment that reduced crewmembers’ availability to perform other important mission tasks.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Thus, in light of the potential for similar, if not superior, physiologic protection coupled with meaningful time savings, the purpose of this investigation was to compare physiologic outcomes after ~6 months of long-duration spaceflight in crewmembers who performed exercise countermeasures consisting of either (1) lower intensity/higher volume exercise (6 d wk<sup>−1</sup> resistance exercise and 6 d wk<sup>−1</sup> aerobic exercise) or (2) high intensity/lower volume exercise (3 d wk<sup>−1</sup> resistance exercise and 6 d wk<sup>−1</sup> aerobic exercise). The study’s original hypothesis was that the experimental exercise protocol (Sprint) would better mitigate spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory deconditioning compared to standard of care ISS exercise (Control). Over time, the culture surrounding high intensity exercise during spaceflight changed. Early successes with Sprint, lack of adverse effects, improved pre-flight cardiovascular risk screening, and other factors responsibly led to an evolution of the standard of care. This study is an exemplar of how research should transition to operations; this transition was likely accelerated by having operations colleagues on the research team. This rapid operational success story does pose a unique challenge to the scientific interpretation of the data; we readily acknowledge the complexity of this situation and the limitation of the evolving control group.</p>

              <p id="Par12">We evaluated the protective effects of a high intensity/lower volume integrated aerobic and resistance exercise countermeasure to the multisystem deconditioning of long-duration spaceflight aboard the ISS; we compared these results to those of the somewhat lower intensity/higher volume regimen that is the standard exercise protocol for ISS crewmembers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Overall, we found significant decrements in bone mineral density, muscle strength and endurance, and cardiorespiratory performance after long-duration spaceflight; these changes were mostly independent of the exercise countermeasure that was performed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Spaceflight-induced multisystem physiologic and functional alterations.</title><p>Individual (open symbols) and mean (solid marks) percent losses from last preflight to first postflight test for control (open circles; hyphens) and Sprint subjects (open squares; tildes) for selected bone mineral density, muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle function, and cardiorespiratory fitness parameters.

              <p id="Par13">In these results are a few noteworthy findings that have important application for astronauts’ mission critical task performance (e.g., extravehicular activity). First, the relative change in ventilatory threshold was approximately double that of VO<sub>2peak</sub>; this is similar to previous findings in bed rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Ventilatory threshold and other defined submaximal work levels (e.g., lactate threshold) have been shown to be more predictive of athletic performance than VO<sub>2peak</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; this raises the interesting possibility that ventilatory threshold may be a better parameter for monitoring aerobic fitness in astronauts because it is more sensitive to change, is more aligned with the submaximal nature of occupational work, and may be a better indicator of fitness for duty (i.e., performance). Second, trunk extension strength (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) was notably improved in Sprint subjects which may be related to the higher resistance exercise training intensity. Preservation of lumbar muscle strength may be helpful for prevention of spaceflight-induced back pain or disc herniation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par14">High intensity training, while novel to spaceflight when this study was first implemented, is not a new phenomenon. It has been studied extensively in clinical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, community-dwelling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and athletic populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>; these populations range in age from young children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> to older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. We and others have evaluated HIT in bed rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, a ground-based analog of spaceflight, where it is largely effective to prevent multisystem physiologic deconditioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The appeal of HIT hinges on two potential benefits: (1) superior physiologic adaptations compared to traditional, longer-duration steady state/lower intensity training and (2) shorter/less frequent training sessions that offer different and distinct advantages for each of the aforementioned populations.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Analysis of exercise training logs revealed that aerobic exercise volume was slightly greater in CON while aerobic intensity—at least for a subset of common interval workouts—was similar between the Sprint and control groups; both groups performed aerobic exercise 6 days per week using a combination of interval and continuous workouts. Before and during the earliest part of this study (2011), aerobic interval exercise was employed rarely in the ISS standard care exercise prescription (CON) due to hardware limitations, but by the end of the project (2017) it had become an integral and regular component of the standard aerobic exercise regimen. Although this complicates the research design, it is increasingly important, especially in complex interdisciplinary research that spans many years, to develop methods of accepting and interpreting data when “standard of care” may change over the course of an investigation. In aggregate, our findings show similarity between the current individualized standard care exercise countermeasure and the high intensity/lower volume Sprint protocol with regards to spaceflight-induced changes in bone mineral density, muscle mass, muscle strength and function, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Based on these metrics alone, one would reasonably argue that the two programs are interchangeable. This can be viewed positively as providing flexibility for exercise programming: while some crewmembers may enjoy higher intensity/lower volume exercise such as the Sprint prescription, others may prefer the somewhat lower intensity/higher volume program.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Despite similar physiologic outcomes, the two programs differ in their requirements for one particularly valuable and limited resource: time. Of the current 2.5 h scheduled for the performance of 6 d wk<sup>−1</sup> exercise countermeasures, ~60 min (45–75 min) is allocated to resistance exercise and ~30–45 min devoted to aerobic exercise for a total daily exercise duration of 1.5–2.0 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The low end of this range (1.5 h × 6 d wk<sup>−1</sup>) equates to a weekly exercise total of 9 h. In contrast, Sprint consumes at least 33% less time than the standard exercise program: three 60-min resistance exercise sessions, three 30-min continuous sessions, plus 3 aerobic interval sessions totaling &lt;90 min equals ~6 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. For future exploration missions with compressed timelines, small cabin spaces, and likely a single exercise device on which to perform both aerobic and resistance exercise for an entire crew, brief high intensity exercise prescriptions will be an extremely attractive programming option due to their efficacy and efficiency. Our bed rest studies have demonstrated that the Sprint exercise prescription is similarly effective over a range of exercise modalities and equipment including traditional ISS-like exercise equipment with or without testosterone supplementation and using only a single compact single exercise device that combines rowing and resistance exercise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Resistance exercise differed most markedly between the groups on its frequency. Sprint subjects performed about half of the number of repetitions on ARED, which is important both from a time and equipment usage/maintenance perspective. If equipment availability were to change in the future, or there was concern about wear and tear on exercise equipment, 3 days per week of resistance exercise, if intensity is maintained at a high level, should offer sufficient protection as evidenced by the mostly similar musculoskeletal outcomes we observed in the two groups despite markedly different total volume loads (sets × repetitions × load).</p>
              <p id="Par18">It is extremely important to note that physiologic outcomes across systems in both study groups (pooled) were substantially better than those previously reported in ISS crewmembers. The most modest differences were observed for muscle strength variables. For example, declines in isokinetic strength about the knee (−6%), ankle (−10%), and trunk (−5%) for the present study were notably better than previous crewmembers who exercised with iRED (knee: −14%, ankle: −14%, trunk: −7%) and moderately better compared to the losses of early ARED users (knee: −7%, ankle: −13%, trunk: −5%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although leg press 1RM losses (−3%) were comparable to previously reported ISS values (−3%), the more functional cone test time (+7%) was better preserved than in previous crewmembers (+11%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The greatest improvements were observed in bone health and cardiovascular fitness. Bone mineral density losses from the Russian Mir station, which lacked a resistance exercise capability, were 1.06%/month (lumbar spine) and 1.15%/month (femoral neck)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. When extrapolated to multi-month missions, such losses were alarming. Incremental improvements were made with the addition of iRED resistance exercise on the ISS (−3.7% lumbar spine; −6.1% femoral neck over ~6-month missions)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Further improvement was observed after the installation of ARED (−2.6% lumbar spine; −4.1% femoral neck)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The data reported in this paper of −1.7% (lumbar spine) and −1.7% (femoral neck) over multi-month missions represent another improvement. Such losses are within the precision error of the DXA measurement and can be considered negligible. It remains possible that changes in bone architecture (not evaluated in this report) could still exist, but bone density is now reasonably maintained.</p>
              <p id="Par20">A similar success story is observed for cardiorespiratory fitness. For the cardiorespiratory system, we measured a 6% decrease in VO<sub>2peak</sub> from preflight to postflight while our previous study of ISS crewmembers found a ~15% decrement in aerobic capacity postflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Together, these data suggest that current ISS exercise countermeasures (both standard of care and Sprint) provide considerably better protection of musculoskeletal and cardiorespiratory outcomes during long-duration spaceflight than did previous hardware and training protocols. These excellent outcomes allow us to consider, for the first time, whether the exercise countermeasures are sufficient or whether additional optimization is necessary. This raises interesting questions: Do we need to completely mitigate in-flight loss? If not, how much loss is acceptable? Does the amount of loss that would be accepted depend, at least in part, on the initial starting point for that individual or the mission tasks or landing scenarios that individual will be asked to perform? It is now time to shift the paradigm to consider these individual details and view astronauts as a tactical population akin to the military, police, and firefighters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. These operational professions have evolved from endeavoring to simply maintain an arbitrary fitness threshold to testing and preparing personnel to ensure that they are physiologically capable of meeting the demands of their job. In the last 5 years, both the Canadian Armed Forces and the US Army have completely overhauled their fitness for duty standards; both retired test batteries that largely featured tests of muscle and aerobic endurance and in their place adopted standards that inclusively evaluate aerobic fitness, anaerobic fitness, and muscle strength/power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. These changes were motivated by the inability of the previous fitness tests to predict performance in the field. In this new perspective that tightly links and subordinates testing and training to job performance, it is easy to envision a primary role for HIT in the preparation and training of soldiers and astronauts alike. Indeed, the developers of these new military fitness standards highlight the direct applicability of high intensity/low volume interval training (in contrast to legacy training that centered on low intensity/high volume exercise) to enhanced health and performance in military personnel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par21">To fully extend this paradigm to astronauts and long-duration spaceflight, we must consider the key functions of exercise countermeasures that are essentially threefold: (1) to prevent long-term negative health consequences, (2) to ensure safe return to Earth, and (3) to facilitate optimal performance and the achievement of critical mission objectives. The two latter purposes are particularly salient to the “tactical population” view and the role of high intensity interval and strength training in astronaut fitness for duty. Return to Earth from the ISS is currently accomplished via the Russian Soyuz capsule in a well-supported terrestrial landing operation that requires relatively little physiologic effort of returning crews (e.g., they are physically extracted from the capsule). Upcoming flights aboard new commercial and NASA spacecraft will splashdown in the ocean with vehicle recovery and crew extraction nominally performed by the U.S. Navy and Air Force. However, in a contingency situation (e.g., an off target splashdown and/or a cabin emergency necessitating immediate evacuation), crewmembers will be required to egress the capsule unaided into a small, tethered life raft. Not surprisingly, preliminary testing with suited human subjects indicates that the physiologic demand of this relatively brief, off-nominal operation is moderate to high (unpublished data). Although unlikely, this operation represents a potential scenario for which crewmembers must be physiologically prepared upon return to Earth’s 1<italic>g</italic> environment. Much more certain—if not further into the future—are terrestrial exploration missions that will include unaided egress and a host of demanding surface operations (e.g., hill climbs and descents, habitat construction, materials transfer, and geologic equipment operation); potential off-nominal tasks include incapacitated crewmate rescue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The functional relevance and metabolic specificity of high intensity resistance and aerobic interval exercise to the performance of critical mission tasks suggest that HIT should be a key component of astronaut exercise training and countermeasures.</p>
              <p id="Par22">This investigation has several limitations. First, astronauts self-selected into the group of their choosing. This was necessary because of the voluntary nature of spaceflight research studies as well as crewmembers’ reluctance to relinquish control of the fundamental nature of their exercise programs especially early in the study. Second, as with many spaceflight studies, the investigation has a relatively low number of participants, increasing the likelihood of a Type II error. Third, by its very nature, the standard care exercise countermeasure program employed by CON subjects included a degree of individualization and temporal change; this is in contrast to the Sprint protocol which was an inflexible experimental protocol. As previously noted, due to the study’s operational environment, the standard care exercise prescription evolved over the ~6 y study duration to include higher aerobic exercise intensities. Finally, not all post-flight testing was completed at the same time; for instance, although we were able to perform VO<sub>2peak</sub> tests for experimental subjects (SPRINT) on <italic>R</italic> + 1, most CON subjects were tested on <italic>R</italic> + 3, the typical timeframe for returning ISS crewmembers.</p>
              <p id="Par23">In summary, we evaluated the physiologic effects of a high intensity/lower volume experimental exercise countermeasure compared to the standard higher volume program performed by long-duration ISS crewmembers. Both exercise programs provided substantially better physiologic protection than historic exercise programs, and for current ISS missions, either program is an excellent option. The Sprint training program had outcomes that were as good as or, for a few variables, slightly better than control and offers several distinct advantages: (1) Sprint can be performed in a substantially shorter amount of time with less exercise equipment usage and (2) it may provide a more occupationally specific training experience that will better prepare crewmembers to optimally perform critical mission tasks while remaining safe and healthy.</p>

                  <p id="Par27">All subjects were matched with a NASA Astronaut Strength, Conditioning, and Rehabilitation (ASCR) specialist approximately two years in advance of their mission. Each subject’s ASCR developed an individualized exercise program based on their group assignment. Subjects also performed preflight exercise training to familiarize themselves with the inflight exercise devices and protcols and for preflight conditioning; exercise programs were not standardized during the preflight phase.</p>
                  <p id="Par28">The Sprint exercise prescription is an evidence-based, integrated training program that consists of high intensity, lower volume exercise 6 d wk<sup>−1</sup> (3 days of resistance and 6 days of aerobic)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Subjects in this group completed high intensity interval aerobic exercise (3 d wk<sup>−1</sup>) and continuous aerobic exercise (3 d wk<sup>−1</sup>) on alternating days (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Specifically, each of the three interval workouts was completed once per week (8 × 30-s intervals; 6 × 2-min intervals; and 4 × 4-min intervals); continuous aerobic exercise consisted of 30-min bouts at 75% VO<sub>2peak</sub> (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Aerobic intensities were initially established based on heart rate (HR) at a percentage of VO<sub>2peak</sub> and HR response to exercise during preflight. Exercise prescriptions were adjusted during flight based on in-flight training, crewmember communication with their ASCR, and in-flight VO<sub>2peak</sub> cycle tests (not reported here). HR was monitored continuously during training sessions.</p>
                  <p id="Par29">Resistance training for Sprint followed an undulating periodized model and was performed on the same day as the continuous aerobic exercise. Most days and when possible, continuous aerobic exercise was performed second, 4–6 h after the resistance exercise session to optimize adaptations. For the typical 6-month mission, resistance training was comprised of a single 24-week mesocycle. After an initial 2-week acclimatization period, load and repetitions were varied on a daily basis (high volume = 4 sets of 12 repetitions, moderate volume = 4 sets of 8 repetitions, low volume = 4 sets of 6 repetitions). Loads were prescribed such that the fourth set of each exercise was performed at near maximal to maximal intensity for the prescribed number of repetitions. Further, subjects were instructed to perform the fourth set of each exercise at each workout to muscle failure with loads for subsequent sessions adjusted accordingly. Thus, all sessions were defined as high intensity with the volume and load varying throughout the week. Subjects rotated among three routines throughout a mission (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Sprint subjects performed upper body resistance exercise similar to that of control subjects (described below) 3 d wk<sup>−1</sup>. Time to perform the Sprint program was approximately 6 h per week (1.5 h continuous, &lt;1.5 h intervals, and 3 h resistance exercise).</p>
                  <p id="Par30">Control subjects participated in the standard care exercise countermeasure protocol. The program typically consisted of 1.5–2.0 h per day total of aerobic and resistance exercise, each performed 6 days per week. Although 2.5 h were scheduled for daily exercise on the ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, typically, exercise time was divided into 30–45 min of aerobic training and 60–75 min of resistance training with hardware configuration and postexercise hygiene comprising the remainder of total allotted time. Aerobic training consisted of interval or continuous steady-state exercise on either CEVIS or T2. The CEVIS protocols were developed using the preflight VO<sub>2peak</sub> test with prescribed work rates (W) between 70 and 100% VO<sub>2peak</sub>. The ASCRs adjusted the protocols during the mission based on individual performance during training sessions and crew feedback. The T2 protocols were based on pre-flight training and prescribed at 70–100% HR<sub>max</sub>. For most crewmembers, external (harness/bungee) loading began at 60% bodyweight (static load measured when standing stationary on the treadmill belt) and increased to ~75–80% bodyweight as tolerated throughout the mission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Resistance training followed a 9-day periodized program with linear progression of loads and undulating volume across two 12-week mesocycles (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). After a 2-week acclimatization period, loads were set at 70% of the repetition-maximum (RM) prescribed for that session (e.g., for a 4 × 6-repetition session, loads in Week 3 were 70% of 6RM) with loading intensity increasing 5% each week. Strength increases over the first mesocycle allowed most crewmembers to reach intensities of 110–120% of their early mission RMs by week 12. For the second mesocycle, loads were reduced to 70% of the crewmember’s new RM (determined from recent training session loads) and the progression of the first mesocycle was repeated. Thus, resistance exercise loading intensity and progression were lower and more conservative, respectively, compared to the Sprint protocol; this was compensated for with twice the workout frequency (6 d wk<sup>−1</sup> vs. 3 d wk<sup>−1</sup>). A variation of squat, deadlift, and heel raises were each prescribed daily for CON subjects followed by rotating exercises focusing on upper body and stability musculature. Heel raises were prescribed as 4 sets × 20 repetitions. Time to perform the CON program was approximately 9–10 h per week (3–4 h continuous and interval aerobic exercise and 6–7 h resistance exercise).</p>

An anatomic reference (knee = 90°, ankle = 0°, trunk = 0°) was measured with a hand-held goniometer during subject set-up for each joint tested. Knee testing was conducted in the seated position over a range of 95° (flexion) to 20° (extension). Ankle testing was performed prone over a subject’s maximal active range of motion rounded down to the nearest 5°. For example, if a subject could attain −18° of ankle flexion and 37° of ankle extension, range of motion was set at −15° (dorsiflexion) to 35° (plantarflexion).

Ventilation and expired gas fractions (F<sub>E</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>E</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) were measured continuously using the Portable Pulmonary Function System (PPFS), a metabolic gas analyzer commissioned by the European Space Agency and manufactured by the Danish Aerospace Company (DAC, Odense, DK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. VO<sub>2pk</sub> was defined as the highest 30-s average and was confirmed by the attainment of at least two of three criteria: (1) respiratory exchange ratio of &gt; 1.09; (2) HR &gt;90% of age-predicted maximum; (3) a plateau in VO<sub>2</sub> (an increase of &lt;150 mL min<sup>−1</sup>) from the previous stage. Ventilatory threshold was defined as the point at which VCO<sub>2</sub> began to increase disproportionate to VO<sub>2,</sub> and V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> increased with no comcomitant increase in V<sub>E</sub>/VCO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>.</p>

                  <title>Statistical analysis</title>
                  <p id="Par43">Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata, IC software (v15.1) setting two-tailed alpha to reject the null hypothesis at 0.05. Our experimental design was a mixed-factorial with repeated observations collected preflight and postflight in which astronauts either participated in the Sprint intervention or the standard ISS exercise protocol. All outcomes were collected preflight and postflight with repeated postflight observations on some outcomes. We evaluated the effects of the Sprint exercise protocol (relative to standard of care) and spaceflight (preflight vs. each postflight) in separate mixed-effects models per dependent variable, with a priori simple interaction terms comparing each postflight to preflight, and simple interaction effects evaluating the relative change from preflight by group. Each of these models included a random y-intercept to accommodate the within-subjects experimental design, and degrees of freedom calculated per our repeated-measures experimental design. Each statistical test also underwent a rigorous examination of the distribution of model residuals before hypothesis testing and while nearly all of our analyses were satisfactory, it was necessary to use the inverse-cubic transformation for one outcome (cone test performance) to meet model assumptions, and to occasionally eliminate an overly influential observation (standardized residuals &gt;3 and failure of the normality test). The data contained in this study constitute private medical information. As such, they are only available upon request in a deidentified fashion from NASA’s Life Sciences Data Archive (Life Sciences Data Archive).</p>
