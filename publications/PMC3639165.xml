              <abstract>
                <p>Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Manned space missions conducted over the past 50 years have expanded our knowledge of the universe, and have led to the identification of a range of challenges that must be addressed as we move towards the next phase of human space exploration. A key concern is how microgravity and other aspects of the spaceflight environment affect bacterial growth, physiology and virulence. Several in-flight studies have reported that the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight can alter bacterial growth and physiology, including increased final cell density, antibiotic resistance, and virulence (reviewed by Horneck <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0062437-Horneck1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>). However, the effects of spaceflight on microbial community behaviors, such as biofilm formation, have not been systematically addressed. Furthermore, spaceflight has been shown to have harmful effects on astronauts including decreased immune system function <xref rid="pone.0062437-Crucian1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Recent in-flight studies using <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models have also shown that spaceflight can suppress the innate immune system <xref rid="pone.0062437-Baqai1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Marcu1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The combined microgravitational effects of decreased immune function in space travelers and increased resistance and virulence in bacteria may be detrimental to the health of the crew during long-term space exploration.</p>
              <p>To date, spaceflight studies on bacterial behavior have been conducted using suspension cultures. However, such cultures do not typically represent real-world situations because the majority of bacteria in nature exist in surface-associated microbial communities known as biofilms. Bacteria in biofilms often exhibit increased resistance to environmental stress, antibiotics, and host defense systems <xref rid="pone.0062437-HallStoodley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Thus, many problems caused by biofilms such as biofouling, corrosion, and infectious diseases are difficult to control using conventional antimicrobial treatments <xref rid="pone.0062437-HallStoodley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Videla1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Indeed, abundant biofilms were found in the Russian Mir space station and were responsible for increased corrosion and a blocked water purification system <xref rid="pone.0062437-StorrsMabilat1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Ground-based studies have indicated that corrosion caused by biofilms can be detrimental to materials that were used on the International Space Station and other spacecrafts <xref rid="pone.0062437-Gu1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. An experiment using simulated microgravity showed that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> grown in simulated microgravity form thicker biofilms and exhibit increased resistance to stress compared to normal gravity controls <xref rid="pone.0062437-Lynch1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In experiments conducted aboard STS-95, McLean <italic>et al.</italic> observed that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is able to form biofilms during spaceflight <xref rid="pone.0062437-McLean1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, their experimental system did not enable quantitative comparisons of biofilms formed during spaceflight and normal gravity. More recently, Wilson <italic>et al.</italic> observed that <italic>Salmonella</italic> cultured during spaceflight exhibited increases in cellular aggregation and clumping, processes that are associated with biofilm formation <xref rid="pone.0062437-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Despite such evidence that biofilm formation may be altered in a low gravity environment, systematic studies comparing biofilm formation during spaceflight and normal gravity have not been reported.</p>
              <p>To examine the role of microgravity on microbial biofilm formation, we conducted two sets of experiments aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-132 and STS-135) where we examined the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen and a model organism for biofilm studies. Previous studies have examined how planktonic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells respond to simulated microgravity and the spaceflight environment <xref rid="pone.0062437-England1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0062437-Crabb3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. CrabbÃ© <italic>et al.,</italic> identified 167 genes and 28 proteins that were differentially regulated during spaceflight, and showed that the global regulator Hfq plays a key role in how <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> responds to microgravity <xref rid="pone.0062437-Crabb3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. To study <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation during spaceflight, we used specialized hardware designed for growing cells during spaceflight, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s001">Figure S1</xref>). FPAs have been used in several recent studies of bacterial growth and physiology during spaceflight <xref rid="pone.0062437-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Crabb3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Klaus1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Briefly, an FPA is a glass barrel that can be divided into compartments by rubber stoppers. During spaceflight, a plunging motion can be used to mix the components loaded into the different compartments via a bevel on the side of the glass barrel. For our experiments, a mixed cellulose ester membrane disc was used as a biofilm substrate. A modified artificial urine media (mAUM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s005">Table S1</xref>) was loaded into the first compartment containing the membrane. mAUM was used because it provides a physiologically relevant environment for the study of biofilms formed both inside and outside the human body <xref rid="pone.0062437-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The second compartment was filled with inoculum stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). For microscopy samples only, a third compartment was filled with a paraformaldehyde solution. As illustrated in the timeline shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s002">Figure S2</xref>, biofilms were formed under static conditions in FPAs at 37Â°C for 72 h. Subsequently, the temperature was decreased to 8Â°C to minimize further growth, and fixative was added to the microscopy samples. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after landing and processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.</p>
              <p>Here, we report the first evidence that spaceflight affects biofilm formation by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, with increased numbers of viable cells, increased biomass, and increased thickness observed in spaceflight biofilms compared to normal gravity controls. Biofilms formed by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during spaceflight also exhibited a column-and-canopy-shaped architecture that has not been observed previously. We show that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in formation of this novel architecture, and relate the mechanism to structured biofilm formation on Earth.</p>

Overnight shaking cultures of all strains were cultured at 37Â°C in nutrient broth (NB) (Difco BD). To prepare inocula, cultures were washed and resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of â¼6Ã10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL.

To ensure reproducibility in media composition, RPMI 1640 amino acid solution (50Ã; Sigma, MO, cat #: R7131,) and L-glutamine solution (200 mM; Sigma, MO, cat #: G7513) were substituted for peptone and yeast extract. The concentration of calcium chloride dihydrate was lowered from 2.5 mM to 0.25 mM to minimize precipitation during storage at 8Â°C. Sodium nitrate, 6 mM, was added to serve as a terminal electron acceptor and enable cell growth when the conditions in the FPAs become anaerobic. Higher concentrations of sodium nitrate were avoided to minimize any effects on aerobic growth and limit the accumulation of nitrite, which can inhibit cell growth. Phosphate concentration was lowered to 5 mM to decrease phosphate availability. mAUM includes 2 mM citric acid and 5 mM phosphate. To test the effects of phosphate availability on biofilms, the phosphate concentration was increased to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi). To test the effects of carbon source, 2 mM citric acid was substituted by 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). The pH of all media was adjusted to 7.0.</p>

                <title>Spaceflight and Ground Control Cultures</title>
                <p>Spaceflight and ground control cultures were grown in specialized hardware, known as a fluid processing apparatus (FPA), designed by Bioserve Space Technologies (University of Colorado). FPAs consist of a glass barrel, rubber stoppers, and a solid or gas exchange (GE) insert (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Glass barrels and rubber stoppers were lubricated by coating with Sigmacote (Sigma, MO) and autoclaved before use. First, a 13 mm diameter Millipore mixed cellulose ester membrane disc (catalog #: GSWP01300) was attached to a solid or GE insert with 3 M autoclavable double-sided tape. Second, a solid or GE insert was inserted to the edge of the bevel in the glass barrel. Next, 2.5 mL of media and 0.5 mL of inoculum were added to the FPA and separated by a rubber stopper. A third compartment, for microscopy samples only, was filled with 2.4 mL of 9% paraformaldehyde. Three biological replicates were prepared for each experimental condition.</p>
                <p>To facilitate group activation during spaceflight, eight FPAs were loaded into a single group activation pack (GAP) that enables the simultaneous plunging of rubber stoppers to mix contents of the compartments in all eight FPAs. GAPs were stored in a Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) that accommodates 16 GAPs and enables temperature control. Cultures were grown following the experiment timeline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Three or five days before shuttle launch, all FPAs and GAPs were loaded. Samples were stored at 8Â°C. Four or five days before shuttle landing, the media and inoculum were combined and subsequently incubated at 37Â°C for 72 h. One or two days before shuttle landing, the temperature was decreased to 8Â°C and the microscopy samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde. An astronaut aboard the shuttle manually changed the incubator temperature and conducted the activation and termination mixing steps. Samples were obtained approximately 6 h after shuttle landing and were processed immediately. Ground controls were conducted at Kennedy Space Center in parallel with spaceflight samples.</p>

                <p>To assess the effects of spaceflight on biofilm formation, we cultured <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms and quantitatively compared biofilm formation between spaceflight and normal gravity. The number of viable cells within the biofilms was determined by plate counting. In addition, the biomass (Âµm<sup>3</sup> biofilm/Âµm<sup>2</sup> membrane) and mean thickness (Âµm) of the biofilms were determined from images obtained from confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with the aid of COMSTAT software <xref rid="pone.0062437-Heydorn1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

                <p>We tested the role of phosphate availability and carbon source on biofilm formation during spaceflight because previous reports have shown that spaceflight-dependent responses in planktonic cultures of <italic>Salmonella</italic> were modulated by nutrient availability <xref rid="pone.0062437-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. When the concentration of phosphate in mAUM was increased from 5 mM to 50 mM (mAUM-high Pi), biofilms cultured during spaceflight showed a 5-fold increase in viable cells (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>), increased biomass volume (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>), and increased mean thickness (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g001">Figures 1AâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s008">Table S4</xref>). To assess whether the effect of spaceflight on biofilm formation is dependent on carbon source, we substituted 2 mM citric acid in mAUM with 2 mM glucose (mAUMg). As with mAUM, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms cultured in mAUMg and mAUMg-high Pi during spaceflight exhibited a 6- to 12-fold increase in viable cell counts (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>), along with corresponding increases in biomass (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>) and mean thickness (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>), compared to normal gravity controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062437-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s008">S4</xref>). Overall, we have observed that spaceflight induced an increase in the number of viable cells, biomass, and mean thickness of biofilms regardless of phosphate concentration or carbon source. The experiments with mAUM and mAUM-high Pi were conducted both on STS-132 and aboard STS-135. The results from STS-135 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g001">Figure 1</xref>) were consistent with those from STS-132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Planktonic growth was also observed to increase during spaceflight only under the low phosphate conditions found in mAUM and mAUMg (manuscript in preparation). However, no differences between spaceflight and normal gravity planktonic cell growth were observed when the concentration of phosphate in the media was increased to 50 mM, indicating that the observed increases in biofilm biomass are not solely due to increases in bacterial growth.</p>

                <p>On Earth, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> forms mushroom-shaped, structured biofilms under hydrodynamic conditions, such as those found in flow-cell systems, in media containing glucose as a carbon source and flat biofilms in media with citrate <xref rid="pone.0062437-Klausen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0062437-Shrout1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Under static conditions, structured biofilms are generally not observed because of limited nutrient availability and aeration <xref rid="pone.0062437-HallStoodley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Merritt1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To assess whether spaceflight causes any structural differences in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms, we compared CLSM images obtained from samples grown in spaceflight and normal gravity. The increased thickness of the biofilms formed in mAUMg during spaceflight is readily apparent from side view images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms grown during spaceflight exhibited a structure consisting of columns overlaid with a canopy, while biofilms cultured in normal gravity showed flat structures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the column-and-canopy structure can be seen clearly when slices of the biofilm, approximately 5.8 Âµm thick, were prepared from partial <italic>z</italic> stacks. The slice closest to the substratum clearly shows cell aggregates that have formed column-like structures with significant unoccupied space. Farther away from the membrane, biofilms grown in spaceflight showed dense, mat-like structures that form a canopy over the columns. In contrast, the normal gravity samples showed uniformly dense structures. Comparisons of the <italic>z</italic> stack slices showed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown during spaceflight formed column-and-canopy structured biofilms in mAUM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s004">Figure S4</xref>), as well as mAUM-high Pi and mAUMg-high Pi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s008">Table S4</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, such structures have not been reported previously. Further, the presence of three-dimensionally structured, as opposed to flat, biofilms was especially surprising due to the static environment in our biofilm culture system.</p>

                <p>Quantitative image analysis comparing the amount of unoccupied space within the biofilm structure also indicated a significant structural difference between biofilms formed in normal gravity and those formed during spaceflight. Specifically, we compared the void fraction of biofilms using the biomass and mean thickness values obtained from CLSM image analysis. Biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a 1.8-fold increase in void fraction compared to normal gravity controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062437-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s007">S3</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>We have shown that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> forms column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms during spaceflight and that flagella-driven motility plays a key role in the formation of this unique structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g004">Figure 4</xref> summarizes how biofilms formed under the spaceflight culture conditions compare with those formed under two common laboratory culture conditions, static and hydrodynamic <xref rid="pone.0062437-Merritt1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Sternberg1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Under hydrodynamic conditions, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can form mushroom-shaped structured biofilms, while flat biofilms are generally observed under static conditions <xref rid="pone.0062437-Klausen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Under static conditions during spaceflight, however, biofilms with column-and-canopy structures were observed. Flagella-driven motility plays a key role the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms formed during spaceflight and the mushroom-shaped biofilms formed in hydrodynamic conditions on Earth. However, the formation of mushroom-shaped biofilms is dependent on a carbon source <xref rid="pone.0062437-Harmsen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, while we have observed that the formation of column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is independent of carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062437.s004">S4</xref>). Both the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms and the mushroom-shaped biofilms have two-layered structures, and the mushroom âstalks" and columns are likely formed using the same mechanism, further evidenced by the fact that flagella-driven motility is required for both. While the top layer of the mushroom-shaped biofilms is an isolated cap structure, the top layer of the column-and-canopy-shaped biofilms is a flat mat-like structure. The canopy is likely an extension and connection of the isolated âcapsâ observed in mushroom-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062437-g004">Figure 4</xref>). While still an active area of research, the size of mushroom âcapâ has been observed to be limited under hydrodynamic conditions in normal gravity by a combination of flow <xref rid="pone.0062437-Stoodley1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, gravity or natural dispersal mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0062437-HallStoodley1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In contrast, the fluid dynamics surrounding cells in microgravity are extremely quiescent because of diminished gravity (â¼10<sup>â6</sup> g) <xref rid="pone.0062437-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062437-Benoit1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Under microgravity conditions, the virtual absence of flow and gravity may promote the unlimited expansion of the mushroom âcapsâ resulting in the formation of the intact canopy on top of the relatively widely spaced columns. The formation of flat biofilms with the GE inserts may be due an increase in biofilm growth rate, either by preventing the formation of the stratified structure or expanding into the space available under the canopy. However, it is possible that increased oxygen availability inhibits the formation of the column-and-canopy structure.</p>

              <p>We speculate that the increases in biofilm formation observed with the GE inserts are primarily due to increased oxygen availability. With the solid inserts, the conditions in the FPA are most likely microaerophilic to anaerobic as the cells consume the oxygen available in the liquid and air bubble present in the closed system. While the GE inserts were designed to provide an aerobic environment in the FPAs, results from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> gene expression studies have indicated that growth is likely oxygen limited even with the GE inserts and that differences in oxygen gradients within the FPAs likely exist between normal gravity and spaceflight conditions <xref rid="pone.0062437-Crabb3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the present study, the direct attachment of the biofilm substrate to the GE inserts maximized the oxygen available for surface-associated cells and minimized the differences in oxygen availability between spaceflight and normal gravity conditions. Overall, in the samples grown with the solid inserts, oxygen is likely a limiting substrate for growth. When the GE inserts were used to increase the oxygen availability, an increase in biofilm was observed and the difference between normal gravity and microgravity diminished. Therefore, the advantage conferred by microgravity is dependent upon resource availability, where changes in mixing, diffusion, sedimentation and other environmental factors play a more significant role under such limiting conditions. This observation is similar to results from Wilson <italic>et al.</italic>, who showed that an increase in nutrient availability minimized the differences in virulence observed with <italic>Salmonella</italic> between normal and microgravity <xref rid="pone.0062437-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. We anticipate that these data will lead to the development of mathematical models describing the physico-chemical environment experienced by the cells under microgravity and normal gravity conditions and insights into the nature of the differences that cause the observed changes in growth and dependence on nutrient availability.</p>
              <p>We have demonstrated that spaceflight can trigger changes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm growth and architecture. To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first evidence that spaceflight influences community-level behaviors of bacteria. Our findings indicate that altered biofilm formation during spaceflight may have detrimental impacts on long-term spaceflight missions, where increases in biofouling and microbially-induced corrosion could have profound impacts on mission success. Furthermore, it will be important to explore the effects of such changes on human health through pathogenic and beneficial interactions between humans and microbes during spaceflight.</p>
              <p>While further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the formation of the unique biofilm architecture observed during spaceflight, this work provides a set of data exploring conditions and parameters that are not possible on Earth. Thus, furthering our understanding of how environmental parameters alter biofilm formation by this key opportunistic pathogen. The unique morphology of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms formed in microgravity suggests that nature is capable of adapting to non-terrestrial environments in ways that deserve further studies, including those exploring long-term growth and adaptation to a low gravity environment.</p>
