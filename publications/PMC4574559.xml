              <abstract>
                <p>Network structures created by hydroxycinnamate cross-links within the cell wall architecture of gramineous plants make the cell wall resistant to the gravitational force of the earth. In this study, the effects of microgravity on the formation of cell wall-bound hydroxycinnamates were examined using etiolated rice shoots simultaneously grown under artificial 1 <italic>g</italic> and microgravity conditions in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility on the International Space Station. Measurement of the mechanical properties of cell walls showed that shoot cell walls became stiff during the growth period and that microgravity suppressed this stiffening. Amounts of cell wall polysaccharides, cell wall-bound phenolic acids, and lignin in rice shoots increased as the shoot grew. Microgravity did not influence changes in the amounts of cell wall polysaccharides or phenolic acid monomers such as ferulic acid (FA) and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, but it suppressed increases in diferulic acid (DFA) isomers and lignin. Activities of the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and cell wall-bound peroxidase (CW-PRX) in shoots also increased as the shoot grew. PAL activity in microgravity-grown shoots was almost comparable to that in artificial 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots, while CW-PRX activity increased less in microgravity-grown shoots than in artificial 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots. Furthermore, the increases in expression levels of some class III peroxidase genes were reduced under microgravity conditions. These results suggest that a microgravity environment modifies the expression levels of certain class III peroxidase genes in rice shoots, that the resultant reduction of CW-PRX activity may be involved in suppressing DFA formation and lignin polymerization, and that this suppression may cause a decrease in cross-linkages within the cell wall architecture. The reduction in intra-network structures may contribute to keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions.</p>

              <p>Environmental stimuli such as gravity, light, temperature, and water have a fundamental effect on processes in the plant life cycle. Of these stimuli, gravity is always present, and has a constant direction and magnitude. When ancestral plants moved from the sea to the land around 450 million years ago, the development of a tough body to resist the force of gravity was critical for their existence [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Terrestrial plants have evolved in the presence of gravity and have developed a cell wall to support their body and keep it upright against gravitational force at 1 <italic>g</italic>, as do the bones and muscles of an animal. The cell wall gives protoplasts structural (mechanical) rigidity and thus directly determines the size and shape of plant cells. Thus, the cell wall plays an important role in the regulation of growth and morphogenesis in plants [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Plant cell walls are composed of a variety of polysaccharides, proteins, and phenolic compounds. Based on the differences in matrix polysaccharide composition, plant cell walls are divided into two groups, type I and type II wall [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Gramineous (cereal) plants such as rice, wheat, maize, oat, and barley have the type II wall, while most other monocotyledons and dicotyledons have the type I wall [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The type I wall contains a large amount of pectic polymers, such as rhamnogalacturonans and arabinogalactans, and xyloglucans. On the other hand, the type II wall contains only a small amount of pectic polymers and xyloglucans, but a large amount of arabinoxylans and Î²-1,3:1,4-glucans (Î²-glucans). In addition to cell wall polysaccharides, the type II wall contains a significant amount of phenolic acid monomers such as ferulic acid (FA) and <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, which are ester-linked to arabinoxylans [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of these monomers, some FA residues undergo a coupling reaction to produce diferulic acid (DFA), which forms cross-links between arabinoxylans, the major matrix polysaccharides of the type II wall [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ferulate network (cross-linkage of matrix polysaccharides by DFA) forms a tight network within the architecture of the cell wall [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DFA and FA levels have indeed been shown to influence the regulation of cell wall strength in gramineous plants [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several biochemical steps are involved in the formation of the ferulate network. In shoots of oat, rice, maize, and wheat, the DFA content changed in parallel with the FA content [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that the rate of the DFA formation is largely dependent on the amount of FA in cell walls. Hydroxycinnamate monomers, including FA and also <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, are synthesized in the cytoplasm via the phenylpropanoid pathway, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first step of the pathway and plays a rate-limiting role in it [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, the change in PAL activity closely correlated with the rate of increase in the amount of wall-bound FA in some gramineous shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to the amount of wall-bound FA, the coupling process of FA, catalyzed by cell wall-bound peroxidase (CW-PRX), is functionally important in the mechanism of DFA formation [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Treatment of maize suspension cells with hydrogen peroxide activated apoplastic peroxidases and thus stimulated the DFA formation [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the promotion of DFA formation was found to be closely associated with the increase in CW-PRX activity in segments of oat shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We found that an increase in DFA content was found to be closely correlated with increased CW-PRX activity in rice shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, both PAL and CW-PRX play key roles and are deeply involved in the mechanism in regulation of ferulate network formation in gramineous shoots.</p>
              <p>We have previously studied the effects of gravity on cell wall properties in plant organs using centrifugation techniques. Centrifugation produces conditions of hypergravity, i.e., the gravitational forces of more than 1 <italic>g</italic>. Hypergravity treatment has been shown to increase the rigidity (mechanical strength) of cell walls [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In terms of the chemical properties of cell walls, continuous hypergravity treatment (300 <italic>g</italic> for 2â4 d) stimulated the formation of ferulate networks within the cell wall architecture of dark-grown wheat shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, hypergravity treatment increased the activity of CW-PRX in the stem tissues of azuki bean seedlings [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results suggest that a hypergravity environment increases CW-PRX activity in stem tissues of terrestrial plants and that in case of gramineous plants, such an increase in CW-PRX activity may stimulate ferulate network formation, resulting in making the firm cell wall structure against the increased gravitational force. From these findings, we hypothesized that, in contrast to hypergravity, an environment of microgravity may reduce the formation of hydroxycinnamate cross-links in gramineous cell walls by affecting activities of enzymes such as PAL and CW-PRX. We carried out a space experiment called Ferulate to examine above hypothesis. In this experiment, we compared the properties of rice shoots grown in space under artificial 1 <italic>g</italic> and microgravity conditions; experiment was conducted at the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) on the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

                <p>Rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L., cv. Koshihikari) was used for the experiment. Three days before the launch, rice caryopses were sterilized in 5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 h and then thoroughly washed with sterilized water. Twenty-five sterilized caryopses were aligned along a groove on 11 mL of 1% (w/v) agar (Bacto Agar, BD, NJ, USA) in a black polycarbonate culture dish (W Ã D Ã H = 40 Ã 40 Ã 30 mm, outer dimensions) that shaded caryopses from light irradiation. We prepared 48 culture dishes. After planting, culture dishes were stored in a Measurement Experiment Unit (MEU) and kept at 2â4Â°C before and during the flight, until the start of the growth experiment on the ISS. One MEU contained 12 culture dishes. In the preliminary experiment, we checked that the storage at 2â4Â°C prevented germination of planted rice caryopses for one month and that cold-stored caryopses kept their ability to germinate and grow during the storage period.

In orbit, the MEUs were stored in the Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) at 2Â°C. Twelve days after the launch, the MEUs were removed and transferred to the CBEF of the Kibo Module.

Temperature inside the CBEF was increased to 22.5Â°C under microgravity conditions for culture dishes in both compartments. Rotation was started when the temperature inside the MEUs reached 20Â°C. The temperature of culture dishes increased at the same rate in the microgravity and artificial gravity compartments, reaching 20Â°C and 22.6Â°C at around 100 min and 3 h, respectively, after being transferred to the CBEF (<xref rid="pone.0137992.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The caryopses were allowed to germinate and grown in darkness for 99 h (4 d), 127 h (5.3 d), or 136 h (5.6 d) at 22.6Â±0.1Â°C. At the end of each culture period, eight of culture dishes for each gravity condition were taken out of the MEU, immediately transferred to the MELFI and stored at -80Â°C. The samples were brought back to earth aboard Space Shuttle STS-133 on March 9, 2011, and transported to the laboratory at Osaka City University. Seedlings were kept frozen during the flight and transportation to the laboratory and were stored at -80Â°C until the analysis.</p>

Excised shoots were immediately boiled for 10 min in 80% (v/v) ethanol and then stored in fresh 80% ethanol until analysis. Before the mechanical properties of the cell wall were measured, the ethanol-fixed shoots were rehydrated for several hours at room temperature in several changes of water.

                <p>The germination rate of microgravity-grown caryopses, approximately 95%, was almost the same as that of artificial 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown ones.

In contrast, under microgravity conditions, shoots were not straight but bent toward their caryopses and roots grew in various directions with some emerging into the air (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). In other words, rice seedlings show automorphogenesis under microgravity conditions in space, as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>

In the previous space experiment [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], elongation growth of rice coleoptiles was stimulated by approximately 5% in space compared with on the ground, in which plants were cultivated independently in space (in orbit) and on the ground. In contrast, the present space experiment cultivated rice seedlings simultaneously in orbit under both artificial 1 <italic>g</italic> and microgravity conditions. The discrepancy in the effect of microgravity on growth may be due to different cultivation systems including incubators and cultivation containers, and to different cultivation conditions such as temperature and gas environments.</p>
                <p>In the present space experiment, we prepared 8 culture dishes (total 200 caryopses) for each day and each gravity condition. After the cultivation, plant materials were kept frozen in culture dish on the ISS and during the flight aboard Space Shuttle and the transportation to the laboratory. The number of recovered shoots was approximately 90% of planted caryopses for 4 d seedlings, approximately 70% for 5.3 d seedlings, and approximately 50% for 5.6 d seedlings. The 5.3 d and 5.6 d samples, particularly 5.6 d sample, contained a number of broken shoots. The 4 d seedlings that had short shoots did not contain broken shoots. Therefore, we assume that the frozen long shoots may suffer physical damage (shock) during the recovery and transportation. This problem needs a further consideration.</p>

                <title>Mechanical properties of the cell wall</title>
                <p>The mechanical properties of the cell wall of rice shoots were measured by the stress-relaxation method [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The T<sub>0</sub>, a stress-relaxation parameter, is associated with viscosity according to the theoretical Maxwell viscoelastic model [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, T<sub>0</sub> has been considered to represent the viscous nature of cell walls: an increase in T<sub>0</sub> indicates that the cell walls have become more viscous or stiff, whereas a decrease indicates that they have become less viscous or looser. Indeed, changes in T<sub>0</sub> have been reported to correlate with the capacity of cell walls to extend (cell wall loosening) in growing plant stems [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
                <p>The T<sub>0</sub> value at 4 d of rice shoots grown under microgravity was almost comparable to that of shoots grown under artificial 1 <italic>g</italic> conditions (<xref rid="pone.0137992.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, T<sub>0</sub> values of microgravity-grown shoots were significantly lower than those of 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots at both 5.3 d and 5.6 d, although the values increased during the cultivation period (<xref rid="pone.0137992.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the analysis of the significance of differences among each gravity condition by the Tukeyâs test showed that T<sub>0</sub> values of 1 <italic>g</italic>- and microgravity-grown shoots significantly increased from 4 d to 5.3 d (P &lt; 0.05), but no significant differences were observed between 5.3 d and 5.6 d. The Tukeyâs test also showed that at both 5.3 d and 5.6 d, T<sub>0</sub> values of microgravity-grown shoots were significantly lower than those of 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots (P &lt; 0.05) similar to the result of the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. These results suggest that shoot cell walls became stiff over the course of the growth period and that this cell wall stiffening was suppressed in the microgravity environment. The present results are consistent with the results of the previous space experiment, in which cell wall extensibility remained higher in space-grown rice coleoptiles than in ground-grown ones [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>

                <p>Our previous study showed that the cell walls of etiolated (dark-grown) rice shoots contained three major DFA isomers: 5â5, 8-<italic>O</italic>-4, and 8â5 (8â5 benzofuran) forms [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A similar distribution of DFA isomers has been observed in the cell walls of wheat shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The amounts per shoot of these three DFA isomers increased substantially from 4 d to 5.3 d (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), as did FA content (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The amount of DFA isomers in microgravity-grown shoots was significantly lower than in 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots on 5.3 d, while the amounts were almost the same in shoots from both conditions on 4 d (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This indicates that a microgravity environment reduced DFA formation, that is the coupling of FA residues, in shoot cell walls. While gravitational conditions did not affect the amount of cell wall polysaccharides (<xref rid="pone.0137992.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the concentration of DFA in cell walls was lower in microgravity-grown shoots than in 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots. In cell walls of gramineous shoots, the decrease in the amount of DFA contributes in maintaining the cell wall extensible or loosened [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, decreased ferulate network formation probably contributes to keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions. In contrast, hypergravity treatment increased DFA content in cell walls of wheat shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>

Lignin thus forms a complex net of cross-links among cell wall components and secures them. Hypergravity has been shown to increase the lignin content of stem organs [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We therefore analyzed lignin content in our space-grown rice shoots. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0137992.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the lignin content increased dramatically from 4 d to 5.3 d. Similar to DFA isomers, the amount of lignin in microgravity-grown shoots was significantly lower than in 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots on 5.3 d, although the amounts were almost the same in shoots from both conditions on 4 d (<xref rid="pone.0137992.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These results suggest that, as with DFA, a microgravity environment reduced lignin formation and that the reduced amount of lignin may contribute to suppressing cell wall stiffening under microgravity. In contrast to our results, lignin content was almost the same in wheat seedlings grown on the ground and in microgravity conditions in space, when seedlings were cultivated under light irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This result suggests that light irradiation may negate the effects of microgravity on the lignin formation.</p>

                <p>The CW-PRX has been thought to catalyze the coupling reaction of FA to produce DFA [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CW-PRX might also be involved in lignin formation, particularly polymerization of lignin [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our previous study, hypergravity treatment increased lignin content and CW-PRX activity in stems of azuki bean seedlings [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. CW-PRX activity may thus be a crucial factor in the regulation of DFA and lignin formation under altered gravity conditions. In the present study, CW-PRX activity was measured using two substrates, guaiacol and FA. As with PAL (<xref rid="pone.0137992.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), the activity of CW-PRX increased substantially from 4 d to 5.6 d, irrespective of substrates, but the increases in CW-PRX activity in microgravity-grown shoots were significantly smaller than those in 1 <italic>g</italic>-grown shoots (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The amounts of DFA isomers (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and lignin (<xref rid="pone.0137992.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) changed in parallel with CW-PRX activity. These results suggest that suppression of the increase in CW-PRX activity may be involved in the reduction of DFA and lignin formation under microgravity conditions. We have reported that both CW-PRX activity and lignin content increased gradually from the upper, immature (growing) region toward the basal, mature region of azuki bean stems and that there was a close correlation between the lignin content and the enzyme activity [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the increase in CW-PRX activity was associated with the cessation of growth of rice coleoptiles [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since CW-PRX is responsible for making firm cell wall architecture by promoting the formation of intra-network structures such as ferulate networks and lignin, an important role of CW-PRX may be to lead the cell wall development such as the transition from a flexible, immature wall to the rigid, mature wall.</p>

                <p>Peroxidases in plant cells are divided into two major groups, class I and class III. Class I and III are considered as intracellular peroxidases and secretory peroxidases, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137992.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. CW-PRX belongs to the class III peroxidases. Class III peroxidases usually form large multigenic families and the rice genome contains 138 class III peroxidase genes [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To investigate the expression levels of CW-PRX, we analyzed class III peroxidase gene expression using microarray analysis data. Of 138 candidate genes, signals of 117 genes were detected, but the fluorescence intensity values of many genes were negligible. Twenty-five genes had a high value of fluorescence intensity (more than 10,000) and the intensity values of these genes changed during the growth period (<xref rid="pone.0137992.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, we calculated the difference (increase or decrease) in fluorescence intensity between 4 d and 5.6 d (<xref rid="pone.0137992.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The intensity values of most of the genes increased from 4 d to 5.6 d. In particularly, the values of genes no. 11, no. 65 and no. 125 increased greatly during this period and their values were lowered under microgravity conditions. In the previous study, we analyzed the expression levels of rice class III peroxidase genes during shoot development by the quantitative real-time RT-PCR [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We have designed a set of primers based on the conserved region of six class III peroxidase genes. The expression levels measured using such primers showed a good accordance with the CW-PRX activity in rice shoots [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using these primers, the expression level of peroxidase genes on 5.6 d was analyzed. The expression level in shoots grown under microgravity conditions (72Â±7.0%, n = 4) was significantly lower than that grown under artificial 1 <italic>g</italic> conditions (100Â±5.1%, n = 4). These results indicate that a microgravity environment lowered the expression levels of class III peroxidase genes in rice shoots. In a recent report, it was shown that a microgravity environment reduced the expression levels of some class III peroxidase genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings and the reduction of peroxidase gene expression was involved in reduced root hair growth under microgravity conditions [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. From these findings, we assume that a microgravity environment represses the expression of certain class III peroxidase genes in shoots of terrestrial plants and that the modification of gene expression levels may be involved in the modulation of CW-PRX activity under microgravity conditions.</p>

Therefore, we also analyzed the expression levels of lignin-related genes using data of the microarray analysis (<xref rid="pone.0137992.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).

                <p>Plants are constantly exposed to environmental stimuli such as gravity, light and water status, and they continually respond to them. Various compounds in plant cells act as signaling molecules that mediate responses to stimuli. Tamaoki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reported that hypergravity treatment stimulated endogenous auxin accumulation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> inflorescence stems, suggesting that auxin dynamics may be involved in plant responses against altered gravitational force. In addition, it has been shown that hydrogen peroxide, a requisite substance for peroxidase reaction, functions as a signaling molecule in plants and it is involved in gravitropism [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Indeed, exogenously applied hydrogen peroxide inhibited gravitropism and induced horizontal curvature of primary roots of grass pea seedlings [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, the hydrogen peroxide signaling may also be involved in responses against altered gravity conditions such as microgravity and hypergravity. In a recent report, it was shown that the level of hydrogen peroxide in callus cell cultures of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> changed in transient microgravity phases during parabolic flights [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings suggest that long term microgravity environment might alter the cellular hydrogen peroxide level by which the downstream signaling events including gene expression would be modulated.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The results of the present study showed, for the first time, that a microgravity environment could suppress the formation of ferulate networks in cell walls of rice shoots by modifying the expression levels of certain class III peroxidase genes and thus the activity of CW-PRX. The lowered activity of CW-PRX was also associated with a decrease in lignin formation. Reduced formation of structures within the cell wall, via the effects on the ferulate network and lignin, may be involved in keeping the cell wall loose under microgravity conditions. Opposite changes have been observed in plant shoots grown under hypergravity conditions [<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0137992.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests that the network structures mediated by hydroxycinnamates may serve a load-bearing function and contribute to the rigidity of the cell wall against the force of gravity. Taken together, the present results provide evidence that gravitational stimuli modify the metabolism of cell wall hydroxycinnamates and thus regulate the mechanical strength of the cell wall of gramineous plants.</p>
