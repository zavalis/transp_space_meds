              <abstract>
                <p>Space mutation causes genetic and phenotypic changes in biological materials. Transposon activation is an adaptive mechanism for organisms to cope with changes in the external environment, such as space mutation. Although transposon alterations have been widely reported in diverse plant species, few studies have assessed the global transposon alterations in plants exposed to the space environment. In this study, for the first time, the effects of transposon alterations in soybean caused by space mutation were considered. A new vegetable soybean variety, ‘Zhexian 9’ (Z9), derived from space mutation treatment of ‘Taiwan 75’ (T75), was genetically analyzed. Comparative analyses of these two soybean genomes uncovered surprising structural differences, especially with respect to translocation breakends, deletions, and inversions. In total, 12,028 structural variations (SVs) and 29,063 transposable elements (TEs) between T75 and Z9 were detected. In addition, 1336 potential genes were variable between T75 and Z9 in terms of SVs and TEs. These differential genes were enriched in functions such as defense response, cell wall-related processes, epigenetics, auxin metabolism and transport, signal transduction, and especially methylation, which implied that regulation of epigenetic mechanisms and TE activity are important in the space environment. These results are helpful for understanding the role of TEs in response to the space environment and provide a theoretical basis for the selection of wild plant materials suitable for space breeding.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Soybean (<italic toggle="yes">Glycine max</italic> (L.) Merr.) is an important oil crop and a high-protein food crop widely grown in China and elsewhere in the world. Soybean is also a popular vegetable in China and East Asia. To develop new varieties of elite vegetable soybean and to meet the growing market demand, our research group selected a new vegetable soybean variety, ‘Zhexian 9’ (Z9), by a pedigree breeding method from the wild type ‘Taiwan 75’ (T75), using space mutation treatment facilitated by the recoverable satellite Shijian 8. Shijian 8, the first dedicated breeding satellite in China, was launched at 15:00 on 9 September 2006, at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The satellite was in orbit for 15 days. The satellite recovery capsule landed in central Sichuan Province at 10:43 on 24 September. The perigee altitude of satellite operation was 180 km, the apogee altitude was 469 km, and the orbital inclination was 63°. During satellite operation, the temperature in the recovery cabin ranged between 20.72 and 7.21 °C. The radiation dose to the sample-carrying part of the satellite module was 2.894 mGy and the average gravity was 1.3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> g [<xref rid="B1-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The T75 seeds were affected by the synergy of space radiation, space microgravity, and other space-related factors. The variety Z9 was selected using a pedigree breeding method for 6 years. Z9 exhibits superiority in a broad array of agronomic traits, including yield, good eating quality, and resistance to soybean mosaic virus and salt stress [<xref rid="B3-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the progeny of Z9 are more susceptible to phenotypic variation than T75.</p>
              <p>Space mutation is a technology that makes use of space environmental factors to cause changes in the genetic characteristics of biological materials, which are then screened and cultivated to potentially select new strains or varieties. The space environmental factors include cosmic irradiation, microgravity, and space magnetic fields, which might induce DNA breakage, recombination, genomic instability, and transposon activation [<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A hypothesis was formulated that transposable elements (TEs) are involved in transgenerational transmission and accumulation of mutations by the offspring of space-mutated materials. The TEs might promote genomic restructuring and plasticity to generate genetic, biochemical, and phenotypic novelties to adapt to external changes, such as the space environment, pathogens, wounding, temperature, drought, or X-ray irradiation [<xref rid="B8-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The transposons in plant genomes are extremely rich and diverse and have played an important role in genome structure, function, and evolution. The first TE nomenclature organized TEs into two classes according to their transposition intermediates in 1989 [<xref rid="B11-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: (1) an RNA intermediate for retrotransposons (class I elements); and (2) a DNA intermediate for DNA transposons (class II elements). This classification has been further refined since 2007, which splits TEs into the two cited classes (Class I and Class II), then into subclasses, orders, and superfamilies.</p>
              <p>Mounting evidence indicates that TEs constitute the genomic fraction that is susceptible and responsive to environmental perturbations and hence most likely to manifest genetic instabilities in times of stress [<xref rid="B12-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It was further established that a major reason for the inducibility of TE activity is their normally repressive control by epigenetic mechanisms such as cytosine DNA methylation, which are sensitive to perturbations [<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, there must be a close relationship between transposon activation and DNA methylation. The enrichment of genes affected by transposons observed in Z9 is similar to the genes affected by methylation reported by other researchers [<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which supports the preceding conclusion.</p>
              <p>Considering the characteristics of the spaceflight environment and the proven inducibility of TEs, we speculate that some TEs are activated in the space environment, resulting in a suite of changes in the genome. We used space mutation of T75 to obtain a new variety (Z9) with several characteristics optimized. In this study, we conducted a detailed comparative annotation and analysis of the two genomes to investigate the effects of spaceflight manifested in Z9 compared with the wild type T75.</p>

                <title>2.1. Agronomic Trait Differences between T75 and Z9</title>
                <p>Significant differences in the number of branches (BN), number of pods per plant (PN), number of nodes in the main stem (NN), lowermost pod height (BPH), plant height (PH), number of seeds per plant (SN), seed weight per plant (SWPP), and 100-seed weight (SW) between T75 and Z9 were observed in 2021 (<xref rid="ijms-23-13721-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These differences indicated the rich phenotypic diversity of Z9 compared with T75. The data for agronomic characters from two consecutive years were basically consistent (<xref rid="app1-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). Z9 produced smaller seeds but a greater number of seeds and seed weight per plant compared with T75. Consistent with these results, in our previous research we showed that Z9 exhibits superiority for a suite of agronomic traits, including yield, good eating quality, and resistance to soybean mosaic virus and salt stress, compared with T75.</p>

                <p>To understand the genomic differences and commonalities between the two sample groups (T75 and Z9) and Williams 82 (the most commonly used soybean reference genome), we compared the T75 and Z9 genomes to each other and with the Wm82 reference genome for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions/deletions (InDels, length &lt; 70 bp) and SVs, which included translocation breakends (BND), deletions (DEL), duplications (DUP), insertions (INS), inversions (INV), and copy number variation (CNV).</p>

These results confirmed the similarity of the genetic background between T75 and Z9 and the strong repeatability between the two replicates. The distributions of SNPs and InDels between T75 and Z9 varied on the chromosomes, which were mostly consistent with gene density (<xref rid="ijms-23-13721-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
                <p>We used the software Manta (1.4.0) and CNVnator to detect SVs between T75 and Z9. The SVs are polymorphisms that are known to impact genome composition at the interspecific level and are associated with phenotypic variation. The numbers of BND, DEL, DUP, INS, INV, and CNV between T75 and Wm82, Z9 and Wm82, and T75 and Z9 are shown in <xref rid="ijms-23-13721-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.

The most frequent SV types detected were BND, DEL, and INS between T75 and Z9.</p>
                <p>The distribution of SVs between T75 and Z9 varied on the chromosomes.

                <p>The aforementioned comparisons also indicated that Z9 was more closely related to T75 than to Wm82. Many variations of Z9 may occur owing to its spatial induction from T75.</p>

The left part of <xref rid="ijms-23-13721-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the total differential TE distribution on each chromosome and indicates that TE variations were greatest in chromosomes 16, 18, and 19, whereas the smallest were in chromosomes 5, 11, 15, and 17. We then compared each chromosome at the TE subfamily level. The abundance of most TE subfamilies was similar to the total TE of each chromosome; that is, the TE variations were unevenly distributed across the 20 chromosomes of the T75 and Z9 genomes. Thus, TEs may show a preference for chromosomal insertion and the TE subfamilies might reflect this preference, and a single subfamily does not show a preference different from other subfamilies. We also observed that the number of retrotransposons (Class I) was much larger than the number of transposons (Class II), which was consistent with the distribution of the two types in plants [<xref rid="B17-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

Analysis of GO term enrichment revealed that variable genes tended to be enriched in functions such as response to stimulus and stress, nitrogen compound metabolic process, reproduction, carbohydrate metabolic process, signal transduction, lipid metabolic process, regulation of biological quality, carbohydrate metabolic process, polysaccharide metabolic process, phosphorylation, growth, glucan metabolic process, cell wall, and methylation (<xref rid="ijms-23-13721-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B).

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>The spaceflight environment contains complex mutagenic factors that might activate TEs and cause a series of changes in the genome [<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In plants, the transcriptional activation of TEs has been reported to be induced by a wide array of activating stimuli [<xref rid="B15-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Transposon activation has caused copy number variation or translocation of a DNA fragment [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We used space mutation of T75 to obtain a new variety (Z9) with several characteristics optimized, including yield, good eating quality, and resistance to soybean mosaic virus and salt stress. The spaceflight environment caused numerous phenotypic mutagenic changes to T75 and, in addition, the offspring of Z9 were more prone to phenotypic variation in actual production. Given that most of the phenotypic variations were heritable, we consider that the phenotypic variation and genetic variation between T75 and Z9 are interrelated. Considering all of these observations, we inferred that TEs might play an important role in the space mutation of T75, even after multiple generations of selective breeding to obtain Z9.</p>
              <p>We detected 1336 potential genes that were variable between T75 and Z9 based on 29,063 differential TEs and 12,028 SVs. The variable genes might be caused by space mutation, which is associated with the phenotypic mutagenesis in Z9 compared with T75. The variable genes tended to be enriched in functions such as epigenetics, defense response, cell wall-related processes, auxin metabolism and transport, and signal transduction. Although space breeding experiments of different plants have yielded diverse results owing to a variety of factors, changes in cell wall-related processes and defense responses have been consistently detected [<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The present results at a genetic level were consistent with this finding.</p>
              <p>The cellular epigenetic maintenance machinery of certain rice genotypes is susceptible to perturbation under the spaceflight environment, which results in not only epigenetic changes per se but also de-repression and transposition of certain potentially active TEs, and these cause further genetic changes [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The genetic changes in epigenetic-related genes might conversely regulate epigenetics and TE activity. This suggests that the epigenetic maintenance machinery and TE activity might constitute a regulatory loop. Twenty-eight potential genes involved in methylation were variable between T75 and Z9. Four of these genes (Glyma13g05430, Glyma13g38290, Glyma19g13480, and Glyma19g17460) encode histone lysine methyltransferases, which direct H3K4 (an extensively reported epigenetic marker for transcriptional initiation) methylation in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="B20-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Extensive previous studies have shown that histone lysine methylation plays a critical role in epigenetically regulating various biological processes, including fiber cell wall development [<xref rid="B23-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These results support the inference that the genetic changes caused by TE activity in turn affect epigenetics. We also observed similar gene enrichment in epigenetic changes of Arabidopsis seedlings under spaceflight [<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and TE alterations of Z9 mutated by spaceflight. Thus, spaceflight is strongly associated with epigenetic regulation and transposon activation. Below, the enriched GO terms of variable genes between T75 and Z9, which are similar to gene enrichment in epigenetic changes of Arabidopsis seedlings under spaceflight, are discussed in detail in the following sections.</p>
              <p>It is reasonable to consider that the defense response is stimulated in plants during spaceflight. To survive in stressful environments, such as space, TEs might promote genomic restructuring and plasticity to generate genetic, biochemical, and phenotypic novelties to adapt to external changes [<xref rid="B24-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We detected 278 potential genes involved in stimulus or stress response that were variable between T75 and Z9. This is consistent with the phenotypic variation of Z9. These potential genes might play a role in the enhanced resistance to soybean mosaic virus and salt stress of Z9 compared with that of T75 [<xref rid="B3-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The present research is consistent with previous results that TE dynamics are impacted by response to stress and thus may reflect the evolution and adaptation of their host to the environment [<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>The spaceflight environment could alter cell shape and cell wall components as a result of cell wall perturbation and change the expression of genes involved in cell wall structure [<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We observed that 27 potential genes involved in the cell wall were variable between T75 and Z9. Two of these genes (Glyma10g07310 and Glyma07g27450) encode pectinesterase (PE; E.C. 3.1.1.11), which is an enzyme responsible for the demethylation of galacturonyl residues in high-molecular-weight pectin and is considered to play an important role in cell wall metabolism [<xref rid="B26-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. One of the 27 genes, Glyma13g27250, encodes cellulose synthase, which is an important enzyme for cellulose production in the plasma membrane of plant cells [<xref rid="B27-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The cell wall is composed of a cellulose–hemicellulose network and pectic polysaccharides, which is essential to maintain the mechanical strength of the cell wall [<xref rid="B29-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The plant cell wall rigidity could be altered under microgravity, which is one factor of the spaceflight environment [<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These results show that genetic modification via TEs of the cell wall biosynthetic process is an important step in gravity resistance.</p>
              <p>Gravity sensing in plant cells involves auxin metabolism, transport, and signal transduction [<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The morphogenesis of plant organs could be changed owing to the effects of microgravity on the polar transport of auxin [<xref rid="B30-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We determined that 26 potential genes involved in auxin metabolism and auxin transport were variable between T75 and Z9. Seven of these genes encode ABC transporters, which play a role in the transport of the phytohormone auxin [<xref rid="B31-ijms-23-13721" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The enrichment of differential genes encoding ABC transporters implies that auxin transport can be modulated in response to spaceflight and may be caused by TE activity. Abundant differential genes (77 of 1336) were enriched in signal transduction, including auxin, ethylene, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid. Alterations in the signal transduction genes, especially auxin-related genes, may play important roles in T75 adaptation to the spaceflight environment and the optimized characters in Z9.</p>
              <p>This study is the first to evaluate the TE variation in the genome structural changes of soybean under space breeding. Transposon insertion exhibits a certain degree of randomness; that is, it may be conducive to plant adaptation to the environment, or it may not be conducive to plant growth. At an advanced stage of space breeding, we might have eliminated the mutations that are not conducive to plant growth. Therefore, we may have lost a small proportion of the differential genes in the advanced breeding process. However, this will have little impact on the present analysis and understanding of the overall TE variations.</p>
              <p>In the initial stage of this experiment, two soybean varieties, T75 and ‘Zhexian 4’, were carried by the recoverable satellite Shijian 8. The latter variety showed no visible variation, whereas T75 exhibited abundant visible variation. Because there was only one sample that was non-sensitive to space mutagenesis, we did not include it in this report. However, we preliminarily analyzed the difference in transposons between Zhexian 4 and T75 and detected transposon alterations in some methylation-related genes, including genes encoding histone-lysine <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-methyltransferase. Combined with the following points: (1) the progeny of Z9 were more susceptible to phenotypic variation than T75; (2) 28 potential genes involved in methylation were variable between T75 and Z9; and (3) similar gene enrichment was observed between T75 and Z9, and in epigenetic changes of Arabidopsis seedlings under spaceflight. Assuming that transposon insertion exhibits a certain randomness, we conclude that DNA methylation is closely associated with TE activation and is likely to interact with each other. Previous reports have shown that certain genotypes are preferentially susceptible to space mutation. Therefore, we infer that transposons at certain sites are susceptible to environmental mutagenesis and operate in conjunction with methylation to adapt to environmental changes. Of course, more samples are needed to confirm this hypothesis and apply it to a selection of aerospace breeding materials. We consider that these issues warrant further investigation.</p>
