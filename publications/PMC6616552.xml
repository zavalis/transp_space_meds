                <p id="Par1">Over the course of a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) crew members are exposed to a number of stressors that can potentially alter the composition of their microbiomes and may have a negative impact on astronauts’ health. Here we investigated the impact of long-term space exploration on the microbiome of nine astronauts that spent six to twelve months in the ISS. We present evidence showing that the microbial communities of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nose and tongue change during the space mission. The composition of the intestinal microbiota became more similar across astronauts in space, mostly due to a drop in the abundance of a few bacterial taxa, some of which were also correlated with changes in the cytokine profile of crewmembers. Alterations in the skin microbiome that might contribute to the high frequency of skin rashes/hypersensitivity episodes experienced by astronauts in space were also observed. The results from this study demonstrate that the composition of the astronauts’ microbiome is altered during space travel. The impact of those changes on crew health warrants further investigation before humans embark on long-duration voyages into outer space.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Astronauts spending six months to a year at the International Space Station (ISS) undergo a wide variety of stresses that can impact crew health and productivity. These stresses range from environmental factors (e.g. microgravity and increased radiation) to social stresses (e.g. isolation, anxiety and sleep deprivation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Space flight presents the further danger of isolation from medical experts, making preventative measures to ensure astronaut health paramount. For decades NASA has studied the effects of space travel on humans and has sought to identify factors that can be regulated to improve the chances of astronauts returning to Earth healthy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As the duration of space missions increases, it becomes more and more important to maintain long term health in space to keep astronauts functioning at a high level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Previous inflight studies have shown that astronauts have reported a range of health issues ranging from GI distress, respiratory illness and skin irritation and infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Many of these symptoms have been associated with a weakening of the immune function as shown by reactivation of Epstein Bar Virus (EBV), and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) during space flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Altered production of cytokines including increases in white blood cell counts have been measured during space flight and associated with altered adaptive immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Further studies have shown astronauts experience immune dysregulation, changes in neutrophil functions, and neuroimmune response during space flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A recent study documented a persistent skin rash in an astronaut at ISS that also correlated with immune dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In addition to physiological changes and reductions in immune response experienced by astronauts, microgravity can also cause changes in homeostasis and microbial biochemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Terrestrial studies of the human microbiome suggest that many of the maladies experienced by astronauts can be caused or exacerbated by microbiome dysfunction. Early astronaut microbiome studies documented the diversity of microbes associated with astronauts and the transfer of the pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> from one astronaut to another<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. While these early studies collected a wide range of samples, they were limited to investigating the small fraction of organisms that could be grown in pure culture. This study documented the diversity of microbes associated with astronauts before, during and after long duration space missions at the ISS using culture independent 16S rRNA gene analysis. The evidence presented herein shows that space travel can have both transient and longer lasting impacts on the microbiome of astronauts, and that these changes are associated with alteration of immune function.</p>

                <p id="Par5">To determine the effects of spaceflight on the human microbiome, we performed a longitudinal study on nine astronauts spending from six to twelve months at the ISS. During the study, astronauts collected microbiome samples from their forehead and forearm skin, their two nostrils, tongue and stool, as a proxy of the gastrointestinal tract (GI) microbiota, at ten different time points before, during and after the mission (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, the crew collected in-flight microbial environmental samples from six different surfaces and one sample from the water reservoir in the ISS to study the interplay between the ISS microbial communities and the crew’s microbiome. Thereafter, we extracted the DNA from all microbial samples and sequenced the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to assess their microbial composition. Also, to investigate possible interactions among astronauts’ stress levels, immune response and their microbiota, each astronaut collected saliva to measure cortisol levels and virus reactivation as well as blood samples to evaluate cytokine concentrations in plasma (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study experimental design.

However, in the GI, Shannon alpha diversity and richness significantly increased in space and returned to their baseline preflight levels after crew members return to Earth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

In addition, we observed a significant reduction in alpha diversity of the nares microbiome during space flight that returned to preflight levels after returning to Earth. Contrary to alpha diversity, overall species richness of nasal microbiota did not change significantly during the mission, indicating that the inflight changes in alpha diversity were due to a reorganization of the relative abundance of microbial taxa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Changes in alpha diversity and richness of the astronauts’ microbiome.

This analysis showed that compositional changes of the nose, skin and GI microbiomes were rapid and became evident by FD7. These changes persisted for at least six months until the end of the mission at the ISS.

                <p id="Par12">To investigate the influence of the ISS as a contained and human built environment on the crew microbiomes, differential abundance analysis of bacterial taxa was performed between samples collected before, during and after the mission to the ISS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref> and Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). In addition, for each of the five crew microbiomes, we defined a core microbiome, composed of all bacterial taxa that were represented in at least 75% of all preflight samples (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). This analysis identified 17 gastrointestinal genera whose abundance significantly changed in space (adjusted p-value by the false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05).

                <p id="Par13">Examination of skin samples also revealed changes in the relative abundance of several bacterial phylotypes during the space mission, corresponding to 49 and 43 genera in the forearm and forehead respectively, ten of which belonged to the respective core microbiomes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref> and Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Noteworthy, skin microbial communities whose abundance decreased in space were mostly Gram-negative Proteobacteria with a predominance of Gamma and Betaproteobacteria. These groups included bacteria from the genus <italic>Moraxella, Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. In contrast, most of the skin bacteria that became more abundant inflight belonged to the phylum Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, including bacteria of the genus <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>. Postflight samples showed a similar trend as inflight samples, with lower Proteobacteria and higher Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria compared to Preflight skin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par14">In addition, we observed a similar but milder response of the nares microbiota to the space environment with a significant drop in two genera of Gram-negative bacteria that were also reduced in skin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref> and Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Likewise, nose inflight samples showed increases in five bacterial genera, four of which became more abundant on the skin of astronauts inflight. Five out of the seven genera that changed during spaceflight were also part of the nares core microbiome. Many of the observed changes in the nares microbiota dissipated after the astronauts returned to Earth, with higher abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, and lower levels of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> in postflight samples. In the tongue, only two Gram-positive genera, that also belonged to the core microbiome, were found significantly reduced during spaceflight, <italic>Rothia</italic> and an unclassified genus of the family <italic>Corynebacteriaceae</italic>, which also remained reduced in postflight samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par15">The analyses of alpha and beta diversity above showed that the GI microbiota of AstB was compositionally different and responded differently to the ISS environment compared to the GI microbiome of the other four astronauts that also collected inflight stool samples. The composition of the GI microbiome of AstB was compared to that of Astronauts C, D, F, and G across either preflight or inflight samples (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Those comparisons exposed three genera that were differentially abundant in both pre and inflight samples between AstB and the other four crew members. Before flight, 23 genera differed between the two groups of samples. One third of them belonged to the families <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> and were particularly enriched in the GI microbiome of AstB, while genera from the families <italic>Prevotellaceae</italic> and <italic>Veillonellaceae</italic> were more predominant in the GI of the other four astronauts.

Contrary to AstB, the GI microbiota of astronauts C, D, F and G became more similar in space. To identify the bacterial species that made the largest contribution to the compositional similarity across astronauts in space, we compared the coefficient of variation (CV) of their relative abundance among preflight versus inflight GI microbial samples. This analysis revealed that only a few bacterial genera, including <italic>Pseudbutyrivibrio</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus 2</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Blautia</italic>, <italic>Fusicatenibacter</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> accounted for more than 90% of the total CV reduction observed in the GI microbiome of AstC, D, F and G during their trip to the ISS (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>).</p>

To investigate the composition of the microbial communities that inhabit the ISS and their interaction with the astronauts’ microbiome, we assessed alpha and beta diversity measurements of the microbiota of six different ISS surfaces (named ssA to ssF, see methods for details) and how they compare to the microbiomes of the crew.</p>
                <p id="Par19">An initial comparative analysis of weighted and unweighted beta diversity distances showed that the microbial profiles of the six ISS sites surveyed were very similar (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). However, PCoA plots showed that the composition of the six ISS microbiomes significantly changed over time, during the 33 months we surveyed the station, with samples collected at early and late time points forming discrete groups (p = 0.001, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). Given that the ISS microbiota resembled that of the astronauts’ skin (see above), we hypothesized temporal changes could be influenced by the arrival of new crew members to the ISS every three months. To test this hypothesis, we compared the microbial composition of the ISS samples from early and late time points to the skin microbiome of astronauts that traveled to the ISS at the beginning or end of the study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This analysis showed that while there were no differences in the species present/absent between skin and ISS samples at either early (p = 0.36) or late (p = 0.5) time points, early skin microbiome samples had a significantly different composition to late ISS microbiome samples (p = 0.001) and vice versa (p = 0.001). Moreover, comparative analysis showed that the mean BC dissimilarity distance between the skin and ISS samples collected by the time astronauts were leaving the ISS (time point FD180) were significantly smaller than the distance between ISS and skin samples collected at FD7, when crew members had just arrived at the ISS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C,D</xref>). The similarity between the skin and environmental microbiomes was only evident when considering the type of microbial species present in the skin and the ISS environment (unweighted BC distance), but not their relative abundance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C,D</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Comparative beta diversity analysis between the astronauts’ skin microbiota and environmental bacteria at the ISS.

                <p id="Par22">Reactivation and shedding of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein bar virus (EBV) and Herpes simplex virus (HSV1) as well as diurnal salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were measured prospectively in 10 astronauts before, during, and after their mission at the ISS to assess astronauts’ stress (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S18</xref> and Table <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Two astronauts did not shed any virus in any of their samples collected during the study. VZV reactivation was detected in the saliva of four crew members. Except for AstD, that showed VZV reactivation by L-60, no VZV was detected in saliva before flight. However, VZV was significantly reactivated in space, reaching a peak by FD90. After 30 days of the return to Earth, three of the astronauts became negative for VZV except for AstD that remained positive for up to 180 days (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). EBV and HSV1 were detected in the saliva of three and five astronauts respectively, but no association was found between detection in saliva and space flight.</p>
                <p id="Par23">No significant changes in levels of salivary cortisol were detected during the entire mission in any of the crewmembers. The inflight salivary concentration of alpha-amylase, however, was higher than preflight values reaching a maximum by the end of the mission in the ISS. DHEA, showed an opposite trend, becoming less abundant by FD90 at the ISS.</p>

              <p id="Par24">During a space mission, astronauts are exposed to a series of stressors that are likely to affect the composition of their microbiome. Previous studies performed under real or simulated microgravity conditions on culturable commensal and opportunistic pathogenic bacteria suggested that space travel may cause functional changes of the crew microbiome, including bacterial virulence, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In addition, studies using culture-based methodologies on astronaut samples collected before and after space flights have identified shifts in the microbial composition of the oral, nasal and intestinal microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. However, it is likely that these compositional changes are only reflective of the small number of culturable species and were not reflective of overall changes to astronaut microbiomes. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first project to study the impact of long-term space travel on the astronauts’ GI, skin, tongue and nose microbiomes using 16S rRNA molecular markers from human samples collected in space. Our main goal was to determine the extent of microbiome perturbations experienced during long duration space missions by both astronauts and the ISS environment, and correlate those changes to observed changes in astronaut health. It should be noted though that the nature of this study is exploratory and based on a very low number of participants (n = 9, for stool n = 5) due to the limited availability of astronauts that travel to the ISS. Only six astronauts live and work on the ISS at any given time, and there are huge demands on their time that limit the sampling that can be performed. The low number of participants dramatically reduces the statistical power to detect small fluctuations in astronaut microbiomes and extrapolation of these results to crew members of future space missions should be done with caution. The authors hope that this correlative study will help create a baseline of microbiome changes that can inform future studies of astronauts that include increased sampling of a more diverse range of participants that will allow researchers to draw more robust conclusions and lead to the development of predictive models.</p>
              <p id="Par25">It has been previously proposed that the diversity of commensal bacteria that inhabit different ecological niches of the human body are likely to decrease during long space missions, increasing the risk of opportunistic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, our results showed that the Shannon alpha diversity and richness of the GI microbiota significantly increase during six-month missions to the ISS. Also, analysis of stool sample beta diversity showed that compositional differences between pre and inflight GI microbial communities were explained by both shifts in their relative abundance and the acquisition or loss of species during the trip to space (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par26">Investigations of individual astronauts showed that only four out of the five astronauts that collected stool samples in space exhibited increases in GI alpha diversity while at the ISS. AstB’s GI microbiome remained relatively unchanged over the course of the study and had the highest number of bacterial species among all five astronauts tested (p &lt; 0.05). It is possible that the highly diverse intestinal flora of AstB made it more resilient to perturbations when exposed to the space environment, as has been previously proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Our results are also in agreement with a 16S rRNA gene analysis of the intestinal microbiota from mice flown for 13 days on the Space Shuttle Atlantis that did not find any changes in bacterial alpha diversity between pre and postflight stool samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. These results do however highlight that comparative analysis between pre and postflight samples does not reflect the changes to the human microbiome that were observed during space flight. Increasing the frequency and number of participants for inflight sampling should be a priority of future studies.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Analysis of astronaut GI microbiome beta diversity also revealed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota changed in space and tended to become more similar across astronauts, even though not all crew members spent mission time together in the ISS (see diagram from Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). It is likely that a driver of this compositional convergence in the GI was the astronauts shifting to the ISS food system, which while diverse (200+ choices), is more similar than the astronauts eating habits on Earth. While many studies have documented rapid microbiome adjustment to changes in diet, the contribution of confounding factors associated with space travel (e.g. microgravity, stress or immune dysregulation) cannot be ruled out.</p>
              <p id="Par28">It is not clear whether the observed alterations in the GI microbiome during spaceflight pose a risk to astronauts’ health. Changes such as the increase in alpha diversity and the relative abundance of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> species, a commensal intestinal bacterium associated with a healthy GI tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, appear to indicate that the ISS environment has a neutral or beneficial effect on the intestinal health of the crew. However, changes in the relative abundance of <italic>Fusicatenibacter</italic>, <italic>Pseudobutyvibrio</italic>, <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and <italic>Parasutterella</italic>, and the increase of some pro-inflammatory cytokines present conflicting indicators that suggest that increases in alpha diversity and richness during spaceflight are not reflective of an increase in GI health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Indeed, our study identified space-associated increases in the relative abundance of <italic>Parasutterella</italic>, which has been positively associated with chronic intestinal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, we found a space-associated reduction in the relative abundance of intestinal <italic>Fusicatenibacter, Pseudobutyvibrio</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, three bacterial genera with anti-inflammatory properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. <italic>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</italic> is reduced in the GI of patients with active ulcerative colitis and ameliorates colitis in a mouse model of IBD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Also, our study found that the levels of intestinal <italic>Fusicatenibacter</italic> negatively correlated with the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1b, that were slightly but significantly increased in space (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). <italic>Pseudobutyrivibrio</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, two bacterial taxa whose abundance has been found inversely correlated with several inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, stimulate the production of SCFA in the intestine, which contributes to the integrity of the gut epithelium and reduces the intestinal inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. These results suggest that the observed alterations in the composition of the GI microbiome may contribute to the moderate increase in the inflammatory immune response observed in the crew during space flight. If that is the case, then treatments known to block inflammation in the GI, such as the administration of prebiotics or treatment with the probiotic bacteria <italic>A. muciniphila</italic>, could be implemented in space to reduce the risk of diseases associated with chronic inflammatory responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The response of the forehead and forearm skin microbiota to the ISS environment varied among astronauts, with alpha diversity and richness going up or down, depending upon the individual, but was consistent within astronauts between forehead and forearm skin. It is not clear what factors contributed to this differential response to space travel. It is possible that the composition of the microbial communities of the skin, skin-specific properties such as moisture and pH and/or astronauts’ personal hygiene habits have played a role in the differential response of the skin microbiota to spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par30">In spite of the bimodal variance amongst astronaut skin microbiomes, we found shifts in the microbial composition that were common across all crew members during space flight. These changes involved a significant inflight reduction of Proteobacteria, mostly Gamma and Betaproteobacteria, with a concomitant increase in Firmicutes, including Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species. It is difficult to predict whether these compositional changes may have deleterious consequences to astronauts’ health. Previous studies have found that patients with atopy have lower Proteobacteria diversity on their skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In particular, Gammaproteobacteria have been found inversely associated with inflammation and allergy sensitization. Moreover, studies have shown that skin Gammaproteobacteria of the genus <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, which is reduced in space (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), positively correlated with the baseline expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in healthy young individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> and conferred protection against allergic responses in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Among the most common clinical episodes astronauts experience during space travel are a high frequency of skin hypersensitivity reactions/rashes and skin infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that the reduction of skin Gammaproteobacteria may contribute to the occurrence of these clinical episodes. It is not clear why Gamma and Betaproteobacteria abundance decreased in the skin of crew members during spaceflight. A study by Ruokolainen <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that there is a positive association between the proportion of forest and agricultural lands that compose the environment and the relative abundance of skin Proteobacteria in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Based on that study, it is possible that the lack of a “green” environment plus the constant filtration of environmental air in the ISS contributes to the overall reduction of skin Proteobacteria. Another factor that could contribute to changes in the microbial communities of the skin is the alteration of the skin structure during spaceflight. A pilot study based on a single crew member spending six months in the ISS found a delayed cellular proliferation of the basal skin layer together with a thinning of the upper layer of the epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, which could increase the exposure of the microbial communities that reside in the deeper layers of the skin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. This change in skin structure might also facilitate the establishment of skin infections by opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species that increased during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. While changes in the skin microbiome likely contribute to the high frequency of skin infection episodes recorded in space, the observed correlations cannot inform causation due to a wide range of confounding factors.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Compared to the skin microbiome, fewer inflight changes were found in the nose microbiome. These changes partly resembled those undergone by the microbiome of the skin and were characterized by a drop in both alpha diversity and two Gram-negative bacterial genera together with an increase in five genera including <italic>Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium-1</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>. The observation that no significant change in species richness in the nares microbiome suggests that the lower inflight alpha diversity was due to a less even relative abundance of bacterial species in the nares, rather than to a loss of species. During space travel, astronauts have reported experiencing prolonged congestion symptoms, rhinitis and sneezing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A number of studies have found a higher abundance of Staphylococcal bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> and a reduction in diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> has also been found positively associated with other respiratory diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. While other factors could be playing a role in the upper respiratory symptoms experienced by the crew at the ISS, an elevated relative abundance of nasal Staphylococcal bacteria is consistent with these symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Our study also found elevated levels of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> in the nares microbiome during spaceflight. Oral administration of some <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species has been shown to ameliorate allergic rhinitis symptoms in human patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> and in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Whether the observed increase of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> abundance in the nares may have a similar protective effect on astronauts during spaceflight warrants further investigations.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Our data show that inflight compositional changes in the GI, nose and skin microbiomes occur very early during the space mission and in most astronauts are readily evident by FD7. In addition, we found that these changes remain relatively stable in space, at least for up to 180 days.</p>
              <p id="Par34">It is known that stress may have a deleterious effect on the human microbiome and the immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. In this study we measured latent herpes virus reactivation and the concentration of stress hormones in saliva, markers frequently used to assess astronaut stress during space missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This analysis found four astronauts with significantly elevated levels of salivary VZV DNA by FD90 compared to preflight samples. Also, our analysis did not find any associations between EBV or HSV1 virus reactivation and space travel. However, of the three astronauts positive for EBV, two had elevated levels of EBV DNA in saliva during space flight and the remaining astronaut shed VZV in space. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that astronauts with latent EBV infections often experience viral reactivation well before their departure to space and many remain positive after their return to Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Also, our assessment of VZV DNA in saliva agrees with studies showing that VZV reactivation in astronauts occurs mainly during the space mission and continues after astronauts return to Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. It is yet not clear the medical implications of latent virus reactivation during space flight, considering that none of the participating subjects had episodes of mononucleosis or reported the appearance of blisters and therefore, the observed reactivations were subclinical.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Our analysis also detected significant changes associated with space flight in two out of the three stress hormones measured. Salivary alpha-amylase, a marker associated with psychosocial stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, was found elevated after the second half of the space mission. Alpha-amylase has been also proposed as a positive surrogate marker of activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, the elevated levels of alpha-amylase could be reflective of the increased sympathetic activity experienced by astronauts in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. In addition, our study found that DHEA concentration in saliva was lower than the preflight baseline starting at FD90 and tended to remain low up to 180 days after the return to Earth, as it has been previously reported for other space missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that DHEA levels are increased by acute stress and that may have a beneficial effect on helping people cope with unwanted neurobehavioral effects caused by stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. DHEA has also been shown to have a protective effect against a number of infections in mice, including viral infections such as herpes simplex type 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> and play a role in the regulation of the immune response during acute stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Whether the inflight reduction in DHEA contributes to VZV and EBV reactivation during space missions warrants further investigations.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Our study did not detect any significant change in the salivary concentration of cortisol during flight, even though previous studies have found that this hormone increase during a mission to space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. One possible explanation of this discrepancy is that salivary cortisol levels start high early in the morning and rapidly decrease during the day. Participating crewmembers collected their saliva samples at the beginning of the day, but the specific time of collection was not fixed. Therefore, it is possible that the noise introduced in the data by shifts in saliva collection times plus the low number of participating subjects reduced the detection power of our assay. However, we cannot rule out other potential factors.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Examination of six distinct surfaces of the ISS revealed that there is a strong interaction between the forehead and forearm skin microbiome of astronaut crew members and the ISS environments surveyed in our study. Studies of the environmental microbiome of family homes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup> and sterile rooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup> have demonstrated the rapid transfer of skin associated microbes from individuals to the areas they reside in. Also, a previous 16S rRNA gene survey of the ISS environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup> observed an abundance of human skin associated microbes throughout the ISS but was not able to compare those samples to the skin microbes of the astronauts residing at ISS at the time.</p>
              <p id="Par38">The ISS is an extremely isolated environment with a low influx of new microbes, so it is not surprising that the surfaces of ISS resemble astronaut skin microbiomes. It is interesting to note that most microbes detected on surfaces within the ISS are transient, and that shortly after one crew departs and a new crew arrives, the distribution of microbes on the ISS changes to reflect its new crew’s skin microbiome. It is also important to note that samples taken from ISS surfaces later in the study no longer had any similarity to earlier crew member skin microbiomes. Still, we found that a small proportion of the environmental bacteria were ubiquitously present in the ISS and therefore, are likely either long-term residents of the space station or microbes that are extremely common on humans. These results agree with a previous 16S rRNA gene survey that showed that the bacterial communities of the ISS mostly belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref></sup>. The same study also found that <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> were common in the ISS. In addition to these two genera, our study also found a high prevalence of species of the genera <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Cloacibacterium</italic> on ISS surfaces. Although many species of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Cloacibacterium</italic> are non-pathogenic natural commensals of the human skin and mucosa, there are a few species that are considered opportunistic pathogens that lead to a number of human infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the virulence characteristics of these bacterial species need to be further investigated before evaluating their potential risk to astronauts’ health during long-duration space missions. It is noteworthy that even though highly prevalent residents of the ISS represented less than 4% of the OTUs identified on ISS surfaces, more than 65% of them had their abundance differentially changed on the two skin sites. It is not clear why there was an overrepresentation of Beta and Gammaproteobacteria species in the ISS while the abundance of the same bacterial OTUs drops on the astronauts’ skin. One plausible explanation could be that potential changes in the skin structure during long stays in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> enhances the translocation of Beta and Gamma proteobacteria from the crew’s skin to the ISS environment. The accompanying increase in the relative abundance of skin <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Bacilli</italic> could then be the direct result of the drop of skin Proteobacteria or due to factors associated with the ISS environment that favor their growth or prolong their survivability.</p>
              <p id="Par39">It should be noted that general trends described in this paper do not necessarily reflect what happens at the single subject level. For example, although <italic>Akkermansia</italic> abundance drops in inflight stool samples of all 5 astronauts, this change is only statistically significant in two out of the five astronauts. This could be due to a drop in statistical power when the analysis is done at the individual level or could indicate that the differences are actually reflective of individuals having different reactions to spaceflight based on a range of factors like their own personal chemistry or diet habits. Studies involving a far larger number of individuals will be required to determine global patterns of microbiome change to spaceflight, model microbiome responses in space to enable prediction of changes likely for an individual and differentiate benign microbiome perturbations from those that are likely to negatively impact any given astronaut’s health.</p>

Of the nine participants, four opted out of in-flight stool collection. Two of the astronauts were women, and seven were men. Astronauts participate in many studies while on earth or at ISS, and astronauts participating in studies that would influence or manipulate their microbiome (e.g. taking a probiotic) directly or indirectly were not eligible.

There is no true positive control for a human microbiome due to high variability between individuals, so sampling began 240 days before flight (L-240) to establish a baseline of microbiome variability and content. Four samples (L-240, L-150, L-90, and L-60) were taken pre-flight. Three in-flight samples (FD7, FD90 and FD180) were collected for nine of the astronauts. An additional FD360 time point was taken by the 1-year astronaut.

The 22 bead populations vary by fluorescence intensity so that they may be resolved for individual analysis. Bead cytokine concentrations were then washed and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody, specific for each cytokine, but fluorescing along a single channel distinct from the bead populations. The assay was performed in a 96 well plate, and analysis was performed using a Luminex Magpix instrument (Luminex, Inc., Austin, Texas). Samples from a single crewmember were processed in a single batch.</p>

                  <p id="Par47">Inference on the dynamic effect of flight on cytokine expression levels was based on regression models for 19 of the 22 cytokines originally considered. For 17 of these cytokines, expression values were transformed to satisfy statistical model assumptions for mixed-effects regression such as normality and homoscedasticity, however, the particular transformation used depended on the cytokine (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In addition, expression values for five cytokines were sometimes below detectable limits (left censoring). For two of these five, we were still able to compare the time periods using right-censored lognormal regression on the reciprocal expression levels; however, there were too many censored observations to allow analysis for the remaining three cytokines (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). For each of the 19 cytokines analyzed, we considered four comparisons (FD7, FD180, R + 0, and R + 180) with respect to the baseline time point at L-60. Thus overall, we made 76 tests of the null hypothesis of no effect. To correct for multiplicity, statistical significance was defined as p-values being less than a threshold calculated by controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR) to an acceptable level using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (82) as implemented in Stata 15 software (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: Stata Corp LP). For reporting purposes, we used the threshold p &lt; 0.0063 corresponding to a FDR of 5%, However the level of FDR necessary to consider a particular test result and all others with smaller p-values significant, known as the “q”-value was also calculated and included in Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>.</p>

                  <title>Exploring possible association between changes in cytokine expression and bacteria relative abundance</title>
                  <p id="Par48">In an exploratory analysis, we used Somers’ D to quantify relations between expression levels for each of 22 cytokines in combination with relative abundance for each of 32 OTUs found to undergo change during spaceflight (FDR ≤ 0.1) in the GI. Somers’ D is a non-parametric measure of association related to Kendall’s Tau. Kendall’s Tau can be expressed as the probability of “concordance” minus the probability of “discordance” between randomly selected pairs taken from two disparate but quantitative measures “<italic>Y</italic>” and “<italic>X</italic>”. In this application, “<italic>Y</italic>” is the bacterial relative abundance and “<italic>X</italic>” is the cytokine expression level. Because we are interested in comparing changes within subjects the pairs were restricted to the same subject’s test sessions comprising L-60, FD7, FD180, R + 0, and R + 180. Only data from stool and blood samples that were taken at approximately these times were used in this analysis. In the definition of Tau, “concordance” means that the change in relative abundance from one session to another and the corresponding change in expression level were in the same direction. “Discordance” means that the changes were in opposite directions. Somers’ D is defined similarly, except that the probabilities are conditional, excluding ties in the first measure (relative abundance). This is appropriate in this application because we only considered changes in relative abundance that were at least two-fold. Being a difference of two probabilities, Somers’ D is scaled within the range of −1 (perfect discordance) to +1 (perfect concordance) between the two variables of interest.</p>
                  <p id="Par49">To implement the analysis, we first transformed relative abundance (<italic>RA</italic>) to discrete levels that differed by at least twofold by defining <italic>Y</italic> as the nearest multiple of log(2) in log(<italic>RA</italic>) for <italic>RA</italic> &gt; 0. For the case <italic>RA</italic> = 0, we defined <italic>Y</italic> to be one multiple of log(2) less than the lowest level for <italic>RA</italic> &gt; 0. By using <italic>Y</italic> instead of <italic>RA</italic> in the calculation of D, we ensured that only changes in <italic>RA</italic> of at least twofold are considered. Defining <italic>Y</italic> as above and <italic>X</italic> = the log transform of cytokine expression, we used the command <italic>somersd</italic> as implemented in the Stata 15 Statistical Software (Release 15) to calculate D, its standard error, and corresponding <italic>p</italic>-value for 704 = 32 × 22 combinations of bacteria and cytokines. To flag combinations as having shown “significant” association, we again used the method described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup> to control the false discovery rate (FDR) to 1%, corresponding to a <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of 0.00038. Because the resampling method used to obtain the standard error of D is not reliable for very small samples, we excluded from consideration any combination that failed to support at least 10 comparisons with RA &gt; 0 and cytokine expression above the lowest detectable limit. As a result, <italic>p</italic>-values were actually calculated for only 487 of the original 704 combinations.</p>
