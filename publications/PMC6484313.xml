                <p>Impaired osteoblast proliferation plays fundamental roles in microgravity‐induced bone loss, and cell cycle imbalance may result in abnormal osteoblast proliferation. However, whether microgravity exerts an influence on the cell cycle in osteoblasts or what mechanisms may underlie such an effect remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we confirmed that simulated microgravity inhibits osteoblast proliferation. Then, we investigated the effect of mechanical unloading on the osteoblast cell cycle and found that simulated microgravity arrested the osteoblast cell cycle in the G<sub>2</sub> phase. In addition, our data showed that cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts from simulated microgravity was mainly because of decreased cyclin B1 expression. Furthermore, miR‐181c‐5p directly inhibited cyclin B1 protein translation by binding to a target site in the 3′UTR. Lastly, we demonstrated that inhibition of miR‐181c‐5p partially counteracted cell cycle arrest and decreased the osteoblast proliferation induced by simulated microgravity. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase in primary mouse osteoblasts partially through the miR‐181c‐5p/cyclin B1 pathway. This work may provide a novel mechanism of microgravity‐induced detrimental effects on osteoblasts and offer a new avenue to further investigate bone loss induced by mechanical unloading.</p>

              <p>Bone is a dynamically remodelled tissue that requires gravity‐mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of the mineral content and structure.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Numerous studies have shown that mechanical stimulation increases bone formation in modelling the skeleton, whereas reduced mechanical loading, as observed in patients subjected to prolonged immobilization or bed rest and in astronauts in a microgravity environment, results in reduced bone mass.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Impaired osteoblast proliferation is believed to play an important role in microgravity‐induced bone loss.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> The mechanisms by which microgravity exerts these detrimental effects on osteoblast proliferation remain unclear and merit further research.</p>
              <p>Accumulating evidence has indicated that an imbalance of cell cycle progression may result in abnormal cell proliferation and even carcinogenesis.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Cell cycle arrest induced by microgravity has been observed in many cell types, including myoblasts,<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Arabidopsis cells,<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> leucocytes<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Although microgravity has been implicated in halting cell cycle progression, the precise mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. Cell cycle progression is critically regulated by the sequential activation of cyclins and cyclin‐dependent kinases (Cdks).<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> In mammalian cells, the transition from the G<sub>2</sub> phase into mitosis is controlled by the activation of the maturation promoting factor, the major component of which is the cyclin B1‐Cdc2 kinase complex.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> The Cdc2 (also known as Cdk1) catalytic subunit is regulated by a series of coordinated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Activation of Cdc2 is prevented by its phosphorylation at Thr14/Tyr15 by the protein kinases Wee1 and Myt1.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Dephosphorylation of Thr14/Tyr15 by the protein phosphatase Cdc25 eventually activates the Cdc2‐cyclin B1 complex, which allows for progression to mitosis.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Cdc2 activity is also regulated by the availability of the cyclin subunits. During the S phase, cyclin B1 mRNA and protein begin to accumulate, and their levels are highest during the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> As cells progress through mitosis, cyclin B1 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the anaphase‐promoting complex.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> In addition, the activated cyclin B1‐Cdc2 kinase complex translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, which is required for cells to enter mitosis.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>
</p>
              <p>Recent studies have shown that in addition to the ubiquitination and anaphase‐promoting complex mentioned above, there are other factors that participate in cyclin B1 regulation.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> MicroRNA (miRNA), which is a family of small, single‐stranded non‐coding RNA molecules, has been well studied and it functions in the silencing and post‐transcriptional regulation of gene expression.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Gene expression is repressed by miRNAs through base‐pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> It is estimated that miRNAs regulate more than 30% of human protein‐coding genes, demonstrating the essential role of miRNAs in modulating gene expression.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Several studies have shown that miR‐199a‐5p,<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> miR‐410<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> and miR‐379<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> mediate the cell cycle by directly regulating cyclin B1 (Ccnb1) expression in several cell types of cells. However, the function of these miRNAs in osteoblasts has not been confirmed.</p>
              <p>Taken together, these data suggest that impaired osteoblast proliferation plays an important role in microgravity induced‐bone loss and that cell cycle disorders may lead to decreased osteoblast proliferation. In addition, miRNAs may take part in the regulation of the cell cycle in osteoblasts. However, little is known about whether microgravity exerts an influence on the cell cycle in osteoblasts, and the possible mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In the present study, we have been suggested that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in primary mouse osteoblasts through a miRNA/cyclin pathway. We therefore examined the effects of simulated microgravity on osteoblast proliferation and cell cycle progression with methods including 5‐ethynyl‐2′‐deoxyuridine (EdU) labelling, immunostaining approaches and flow cytometry. Then, we used real‐time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and specific immunostaining approaches to examine the effects of simulated microgravity on the function of the cyclin B1‐Cdc2 kinase complex. In addition, we assessed the role of cyclin B1 and miR‐181c‐5p in mediating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in primary mouse osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions. This study may provide a novel mechanism for bone loss caused by mechanical unloading.</p>

                <p>Primary mouse osteoblasts were isolated as described previously.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Cells were used at passages 3‐5. Then, cells were confirmed to be osteoblasts using a phenotype characterized by Runx2 and ALP expression and the capacity to form mineralized bone nodules (data not shown). To better observe the effects of simulated microgravity, cells were cultivated for 24 hours with serum‐free medium to implement cell cycle synchronization and serum starvation induced growth arrest in the G<sub>1</sub> phase. In addition, nocodazole (RiboBio, China) is frequently used to synchronize the cell cycle. Cells treated with nocodazole arrest at mitosis, and this treatment served as a positive control. 2T3 cells were subjected to luciferase assay after transfection for further analysis.</p>
                <p>For transfection of plasmids or miRNA regulators, Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, USA) was used according to the manufacturer′s instruction. pcDNA3.1‐cyclin B1 or pcDNA3.1 empty vector (Berke, China) was transfected at a concentration of 200 ng/μL, and inhibitor‐miR‐181c‐5p or inhibitor negative control (NC) (RiboBio) was transfected at the concentration of 100 nmol/L. The sequences of miR‐181c‐5p (Accession mimat0000674) inhibitor and the negative control are listed as follow: miR‐181c‐5p inhibitor, 5′‐UUG UAA GUU GGA CAG CCA CUCA‐3′, and the negative control, 5′‐GCA GUA CGC CCC AGG CGC UUU‐3′. Normal or transfected cells were then subjected to clinorotation for 48 hours and harvested for further analysis.</p>

Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with oscillation with primary antibody against either histone H<sub>3</sub> (phospho Ser10) (1:300, ab5176; Abcam), Cdc2 (1:300, ab18; Abcam), Cdc2 (phospho Tyr15) (1:200, ab18; Abcam) or cyclin B1 (1:100, ab32053; Abcam). Then, cells were incubated in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature using Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Invitrogen, USA). Cells were counterstained for 10 minutes in the dark with the nuclear dye Hoechst (Hoechst AG, Germany) diluted 1:4000 in PBS. The fluorescence was captured and observed using an inverted microscope linked to a laser scanning confocal microscope (FluoView1000; Olympus).<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>

                <title>Simulated microgravity inhibits osteoblasts proliferation</title>
                <p>To assess the effects of simulated microgravity on osteoblast proliferation, EdU labelling experiments were performed. As shown in Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A and B, the number of EdU‐positive cells was decreased in cells under the simulated microgravity condition compared with cells in the control group. Subsequently, we employed the cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8) assay to further define the role of simulated microgravity in the inhibition of osteoblast proliferation. The time dependent growth curve of cells was shifted downwards after 48 hours treatment with simulated microgravity, indicating that simulated microgravity inhibits osteoblast proliferation (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). These results are in agreement with the EdU labelling assay. In addition, PCNA expression analysis was conducted to confirm the influence of simulated microgravity on osteoblast proliferation. Our results showed that there was a decreased expression of PCNA in the simulated microgravity group compared with that of the control group (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). These results are in agreement with the previously described experiments.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity has no effects on the cellular localization, expression and activity of Cdc2 kinase</title>
                <p>In the eukaryotic cell cycle, activation of Cdc2 kinase is required for cells to enter mitosis. We asked whether the simulated microgravity‐induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest in primary mouse osteoblasts was because of the inactivation of the cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase complex. As this complex is maintained in an inactive form through phosphorylation of the Cdc2 residues Thr14 and Tyr15, we performed an immunostaining assay to study the cellular localization and expression of Cdc2 and Cdc2 (phospho Tyr15) in osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions. As shown in Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A, Cdc2 expression in the control and simulated microgravity groups was localized intracellularly, but was not nuclear. In contrast, Cdc2 had translocated into the nucleus in nocodazole‐stimulated cells (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Interestingly, there was no difference in the cellular localization and fluorescence intensity of Cdc2 in the control and simulated microgravity groups (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A). Similarly, there was no difference in the cellular localization and expression of Cdc2 (phospho Tyr15) in the control and simulated microgravity groups (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B), but the expression of Cdc2 (phospho Tyr15) was decreased in cells pretreated with nocodazole (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B).</p>

                <p>Subsequently, a dual luciferase reporter system was constructed containing either the wild‐type Ccnb1 3′UTR sequence (WT) or an Ccnb1 3′UTR mutant sequence (MUT) to test whether miR‐181c‐5p directly inhibits cyclin B1 protein translation by binding to a predicted target site in the 3′UTR (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B). The luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that mimic‐181c‐5p decreased WT Ccnb1 3′UTR luciferase reporter activity, whereas inhibitor‐181c‐5p increased WT Ccnb1 3′UTR luciferase reporter activity, but not MUT Ccnb1 3′UTR reporter activity (Figure <xref rid="jcmm14220-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C).

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>In this study, we found that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle to be arrested in the G<sub>2</sub> phase in primary mouse osteoblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cell cycle arrest in osteoblasts caused by simulated microgravity is mainly because of the decreased cyclin B1 expression. Lastly, we showed that miR‐181c‐5p directly inhibits cyclin B1 protein translation by binding to a target site in the 3′UTR, and this is partially responsible for the cell cycle arrest and cell proliferation inhibition in osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions. Our study demonstrates that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase in primary mouse osteoblasts partially through the miR‐181c‐5p/cyclin B1 pathway.</p>

Thus, several ground‐based rotational devices (in particular, clinostats) have been developed to simulate microgravity for cell‐based studies. These devices simulate microgravity by constantly rotating around at least one axis to produce a vector‐averaged gravity such that cells have insufficient time to sense the gravity vector. Exposure to such rotational systems significantly inhibits the proliferation, differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, thereby exerting similar effects to true microgravity on osteoblasts.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>
</p>
              <p>Decreased osteoblast proliferation is thought to play a central role in microgravity‐induced bone loss.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">48</xref> Our previous study has revealed that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation in MC3T3‐E1 pre‐osteoblasts.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Several studies have reported that skeletal unloading leads to bone loss, at least in part because of the disrupted insulin‐like growth factor, and results in reduced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">49</xref> In the present study, we confirmed that impaired cell proliferation is observed in primary mouse osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>It is generally accepted that induction of cell cycle arrest is a main reason for abnormal cell proliferation.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Therefore, we evaluated the effects of simulated microgravity on the cell cycle distribution of primary mouse osteoblasts in vitro in this study. Flow cytometry results revealed that simulated microgravity significantly increased the proportion of cells in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. Further analysis confirmed that cells in the M phase were decreased significantly under simulated microgravity conditions using immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis of phospho‐histone H<sub>3</sub>. Thus, it is clear that simulated microgravity could induce primary mouse osteoblast cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase. These observations are consistent with previous studies. Cogoli‐Greuter et al reported that mechanical unloading inhibits cell cycle progression by arresting cells in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase in leucocytes.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Yan et al illustrated that clinorotation could inhibit proliferation in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells because of the arrested cell cycle in G<sub>2</sub>/M.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> Benavides et al demonstrated that simulated microgravity slowed the proliferation of myoblasts by arresting their exit from the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> There are also reports, however, which demonstrate that microgravity induces cell cycle arrest in other phases. For example, Kamal et al demonstrated that the number of cells in the S phase increased significantly under simulated microgravity conditions in Arabidopsis cells, which led to a reduction of the proportion of cells in G<sub>1</sub>.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Dai et al showed that simulated microgravity inhibits population growth of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and causes cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> This variation in results may be because of the different species and sources of cells, or the different ground‐based rotational devices.</p>
              <p>In eukaryote cells, the cyclin B1‐Cdc2 kinase complex plays a central role in cell cycle transition from the G<sub>2</sub> phase into mitosis.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Tran et al reported that fibroblast growth factors inhibit the activity of the Cdc2 kinase complex to induce a transient G<sub>2</sub> arrest in chondrocytes.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">50</xref> Others have shown that sterigmatocystin induces cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub>phase in human gastric epithelium cells partially through the down‐regulation of Cdc2 kinase expression and activity.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Li et al demonstrated that Cdc2 kinase complex activity is decreased in human herpesvirus 6‐infected T cells leading to cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Intriguingly, in this study, we found that simulated microgravity induces primary mouse osteoblast cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase, but has no effects on the cellular localization, expression and activity of Cdc2 kinase. The activity of Cdc2 kinase is also regulated by the activation of its cyclin subunits. Thus, we further tested the effects of simulated microgravity on cellular localization and the expression of cyclin B1 in osteoblasts. Our findings showed that simulated microgravity has no effects on the cellular localization of cyclin B1, but markedly suppresses its expression in primary mouse osteoblasts. Then, we examined cell cycle distribution and cell proliferation following the up‐regulation of cyclin B1 expression to confirm that the reduction of cyclin B1 was involved in the cell cycle arrest and decreased osteoblast proliferation in primary mouse osteoblasts under simulated microgravity. Our results demonstrated that the overexpression of cyclin B1 rescues the cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase and partially recovers the inhibition of osteoblast proliferation induced by simulated microgravity. This is consistent with other observations that overexpression of cyclin B1 in human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells enhances cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref>, <xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> In this study, we found that overexpression of cyclin B1 showed no effects on G<sub>2</sub> phase in the normal condition; it decreased the proportion of cells in the G<sub>1</sub> phase and increased the proportion of cells in the S phase. One explanation could be that there are appropriate and proper proportions of cyclin B1 and Cdc2. Even if we up‐regulated the cyclin B1 expression, there may be not enough active Cdc2 to combine with and to form the cyclin B1‐Cdc2 kinase complex in the normal condition. Another possible explanation could be that the mechanisms of cyclin B1 in regulating cell cycle are very complicated in primary mouse osteoblasts. Our data suggested that the cell cycle arrest and impaired osteoblast proliferation in primary mouse osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions could be attributed to decreased cyclin B1 protein levels.</p>
              <p>There are many factors can regulate the expression of cyclin B1. Recent works have shown that minute virus of mice infection reduced the protein and RNA levels of cyclin B1 by targeting FoxM1 in human NB324K and murine A9 cells.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Others have reported that long non‐coding RNA 00312 down‐regulates cyclin B1 and inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> Zhang et al demonstrated that IL‐18 can augment cell proliferation via the p38/ATF2 pathway by targeting cyclin B1, cyclin B2, cyclin A2 and Bcl‐2 in BRL‐3A rat liver cells.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> These experiments implied that changes in cyclin B1 expression induced by different factors coincide with the alteration of cyclin B1 mRNA. However, our findings show unchanged expression of cyclin B1 mRNA levels, which does not correlate with the decreased expression of cyclin B1 protein levels in primary mouse osteoblasts under simulated microgravity. Therefore, this result indicated that a post‐transcriptional regulation mechanism may take part in regulating the expression of cyclin B1 protein.</p>
              <p>The small non‐coding RNA molecules miRNAs function in RNA silencing and post‐transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Recently, three miRNAs have been linked to regulation of cyclin B1 expression under different experimental conditions using luciferase‐based reporter assays. Kim et al have shown that Ccnb1 is a target of miR‐199a‐5p in mouse keratinocytes.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> Others have validated that Ccnb1 is target of miRNA‐410 as its overexpression reduces Ccnb1 protein levels and decreases cell proliferation of gonadotroph tumours.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> Khan et al reported that miR‐379 regulates cyclin B1 expression and is decreased in breast cancer.<xref rid="jcmm14220-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> To further explore whether a miRNA family is important for the alteration of cyclin B1 expression in primary mouse osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions, a bioinformatics analysis was performed with TargetScan, miRanda and miRWalk, the miRNA target prediction software, to screen for cyclin B1‐targeting miRNAs. Based on these analyses, the top ten miRNAs that received the highest composite score were selected for the expression assay. We examined all ten miRNAs by qPCR to screen which miRNAs may affect cyclin B1 expression in osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions. Our results showed that simulated microgravity only increases the expression of miR‐181c‐5p, indicating that miR‐181c‐5p may be involved in regulation of cyclin B1 expression under simulated microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>Some aspects of the mechanisms by which miR‐181c regulates gene expression are already known.

Furthermore, miR‐181c‐5p negatively regulated cyclin B1 expression at the post‐transcriptional level. These data identify a novel mechanism and a target site for miR‐181c‐5p that warrants further study. To further uncover the role of miR‐181c‐5p in regulating cyclin B1 expression, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation under simulated microgravity conditions, we tested the effect of miR‐181c‐5p inhibitor in primary mouse osteoblasts. Our data suggested that the up‐regulation of miR‐181c‐5p in simulated microgravity is, at least in part, involved in the regulation of cyclin B1 expression, cell cycle arrest and impaired cell proliferation in osteoblasts under simulated microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that there are some limitations to our study. We noticed that miR‐181c‐5p inhibitor partially counteracts the decreased cyclin B1 expression, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of osteoblast proliferation induced by simulated microgravity. However, other underlying mechanisms for regulation of cyclin B1 expression, cell cycle distribution and cell proliferation in osteoblasts that experience mechanical unloading remain to be investigated. Additionally, we have tested the role of miR‐181c‐5p in osteoblast proliferation, but whether our findings can be extended to osteogenic differentiation and mineralization warrants further studies. Furthermore, the in vitro results obtained using primary mouse osteoblasts in this study have not yet been confirmed in vivo. Accordingly, we plan to confirm our findings in vivo in a future study.</p>
              <p>In summary, our study provides a new finding that simulated microgravity inhibits cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase in primary mouse osteoblasts via suppression of cyclin B1 expression. Moreover, down‐regulation of cyclin B1 expression, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of osteoblast proliferation is partially related to the up‐regulation of miR‐181c‐5p, which is induced by simulated microgravity. This work may provide a novel mechanism of microgravity‐induced adverse effects on osteoblasts, which offers a new avenue to further investigate bone loss induced by microgravity.</p>
