              <abstract>
                <p>The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (<italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic> cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> var <italic toggle="yes">japonica</italic>); and green leaf lettuce, (<italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic> cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Future space missions and habitats will likely include crop production systems designed to provide a fresh, nutritious component to the crew diet. Understanding the complexities of plant growth systems designed with the unique challenges of space exploration missions and the associated plant microbiome is essential for sustaining the health of crop systems as well as the human consumer [<xref rid="B1-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Molecular biology methods to characterize whole microbial communities through omics approaches have led to the understanding of organism and habitat-specific microbiomes. Plants and their associated microbiota exist in a complex association with important functions critical to plant growth and health. Microbes are recruited and assembled on or in plant tissues and organs from reservoirs such as the soil, rhizosphere, and phyllosphere [<xref rid="B3-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Soil microbial communities are highly diverse and are horizontally transferred to the root where, at the rhizosphere, a dynamic and complex ecosystem develops [<xref rid="B7-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Initial soil microbiome composition can influence plant pathogen interaction and disease resistance [<xref rid="B13-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A plant’s phyllosphere hosts a diverse community of microbes that can also influence plant health and physiology [<xref rid="B14-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

              <p>The International Space Station (ISS) is an inimitable, closed environment that has been continuously inhabited by astronauts starting with Expedition 1 in November of 2000. Unlike terrestrial, built environments, the exchange of microbes from outside the ISS is infrequent and primarily limited to the exchange of international crews after months of residency on the space station, along with re-supply missions. Since 2014, plants, primarily leafy greens, have been grown in the NASA Veggie hardware which are small growth chambers on the ISS (ORBITEC now Sierra Space., Madison, WI, United States) [<xref rid="B25-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Fifteen technology demonstrations directed by NASA to grow a variety of crops have been completed to date and currently there are two Veggie units (Serial number (SN) 001 and Serial number 002) in operation on ISS. The Veggie chambers (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) utilize a fan to circulate the air from outside of the chamber throughout the plant growth area facilitating an exchange of airborne microbes between the ISS atmosphere and the chamber interior. Air drawn from the ISS cabin flows from the bottom of the plant canopy to the top of the growth chamber volume. Air filtration is not present apart from screens to filter out large particles within the Veggie facility before entering the cabin [<xref rid="B27-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Environmental conditions in which ISS grown crops have been cultivated are unlike terrestrial counterparts, in addition to an absence of gravity and natural convection. Carbon dioxide levels can reach approximately 7 to 10 times higher than ambient earth atmosphere in the closed atmosphere of the ISS, temperatures are typically between 18 °C and 23 °C and humidity is low (40–50%), however temperature and humidity can be higher inside the Veggie chamber. A collapsible, transparent bellows contains the plant growing area and any plant debris. During the on-orbit operation, the plant crops are tended, harvested, and consumed by the crew and are intended to provide a nutritional supplement to their diet. At the completion of a harvest, all plant growth containers, known as plant pillows, are discarded, or stored frozen for return to Earth and the bellows and other surfaces are cleaned with disinfectant wipes in preparation for the next crop. </p>
              <p>Microbial analyses using culture-based and culture-independent methods of Veggie-grown crops and growth chamber components have been completed to provide baseline data to ensure the microbiological safety for consumption by the astronauts. Subsequently, an in-depth characterization of bacterial and fungal communities associated with three crop grow-outs of red romaine lettuce that may impact astronaut and plant health has been reported [<xref rid="B28-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>Plants grown in Veggie are susceptible to abiotic factors inherent in microgravity plant cultivation such as water stress and humidity control.

The introduction of microbes from the air, water, or human interaction onto the plant surfaces of an edible crop potentially establishes a risk to the consumer. Crew safety and health is of paramount consideration when supplying a fresh food source through Veggie crop production and the characterization of the microbial communities in Veggie furthers the assurance that these crops are appropriate and safe for human consumption.</p>
              <p>The VEG-03D, E, and F series of technology demonstrations discussed in this work are the first mixed crop use of the Veggie facility with the growth of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (<italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic> cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (<italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> var <italic toggle="yes">japonica)</italic>; and green leaf lettuce, (<italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic> cv. ‘Waldmann’s Green’). </p>
              <p>In addition to the demonstration of a mixed cultivar approach and continuous harvest using two Veggie systems, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the bioburden and composition of the microbial communities within the Veggie plant growth units at different locations including above ground plant tissues, roots of 3 plant cultivars, Veggie facility surfaces, and plant pillow materials. We identified through culture- based and culture-independent methods dominant and shared genera of bacteria and fungi in plants, growth substrate, and Veggie facility surfaces. This study demonstrated simultaneous multi-species leafy green growth and the influence of the plant leaf and root associated microbial communities across plant species and Veggie growth chamber components.</p>

                <p>The overall emergence rates for mizuna and red romaine lettuce were 91.6% and 83.3%, respectively. Green leaf lettuce seeds averaged 66.6 percent germination (75% in VEG-03D vs. 62.5% in VEG-03E/F) with two stunted seedlings. After thinning, one healthy green leaf lettuce seedling failed to develop further, resulting in only two out of four pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03E and F compared to two out of two pillows with healthy green leaf lettuce plants in VEG-03D. Except for the two green leaf lettuce plants, all other plants appeared healthy. Tip burn was observed later during the grow-outs in red romaine lettuce plants. In addition, older mizuna leaves also turned yellowish with a dry edge. All these signs occurred after the 30–31-day harvest, and increased with time, especially for mizuna, indicating a possible lack of nutrients with the age of the plant. No signs of disease were found in these plants. Water usage was relatively constant with about one liter consumed per plant per 30 days (<xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). Mizuna required a slightly higher water volume to maintain hydration and plant health compared to both lettuces. These experiments were performed by the crew in a semi-autonomous manner; the water volume was adequate for maintaining plant health, but may not have been optimal, and may have varied among the crew members who tended these plants. </p>

                <title>3.6. Microbial Diversity</title>
                <p>Alpha and beta diversity represent the variation within and between samples. Alpha diversity of VEG-03D, E, and F, determined by the Shannon Index, ranged between 0.1 (very low) and 2.0 (<xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Tables S2–S4</xref>). Arcillite substrate and root tissue had the highest diversity indices followed by the wick, then leaf tissue. Leaf tissue for all plant types had the lowest alpha diversity. Alpha diversity for the swabs taken for the three experiments fell between 0.8 and 1.4. The distribution as determined by the Pielou Evenness Index measurement indicated the genera present were not evenly distributed with values ranging from 0.3 for substrate to 0.1 for leaf tissue. This trend was consistent between all three experiments (<xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Tables S2–S4</xref>).</p>
                <p>Beta diversity as determined between samples with the Bray–Curtis calculation in QIIME 2.0 was conceptualized as PCoA plots (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A–E). Beta diversity was calculated between all leaf tissues returned from ISS (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> and <xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Table S6</xref>). Just over 50% of the variation between plant types could be explained in the 2 axes of the PCoA (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Plants from VEG-03D presented a visual clustering of leaves for all plant types with the exception one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences. The corresponding Adonis statistics provides a permutation statistic of the analysis of variance which provides an R<sup>2</sup> value indicating the % variance explained by each group. The lower the R<sup>2</sup> value the more similar the samples. The R<sup>2</sup> value for all plant types (0.397) indicated that approximately 40% of the variation is derived from the influence of the tech demo (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.001) versus only 10% (0.101) was due to the plant type. The influence of the plant type was not significant.</p>
                <p>Beta diversity was also compared among the plant types to include the plant leaf and root and the Veggie pillow substrate and wick. Each crop type was considered separately within the three experiments (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). VEG-03D contained the following: one pillow with mizuna mustard (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>A), two pillows with red romaine lettuce (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>B) and one pillow with green leaf lettuce (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>C). The PCoA of the three plant types with their associated pillow components in VEG-03D captured a high percentage of the variation within a single axis, with 67%, 76%, and 79%, respectively.</p>
                <p>The PCoAs for VEG-03D indicate that the green leaf lettuce leaf microbiome was more dissimilar from the root, wick, and substrate. However, the root and substrate were similar. Approximately 99% of the variation accounted for within the pillow sample set was due to the sample type itself (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>C and <xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Table S6</xref>). The additional two crops grown in VEG-03D displayed the same trends with root and substrate microbiomes more similar while the plant leaf microbiomes were dissimilar containing a greater amount of variation (97% and 84% for mizuna and red romaine lettuce, respectively) (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Table S6</xref>). In all pillow samples, the wick, which did not cluster with root and substrate, appeared to be more variable.</p>
                <p>The variation captured for the VEG-03E and F experiments was lower than seen in VEG-03D with approximately 40% of the variation explained in the first principle component for VEG-03E (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>D) and approximately 50% for VEG-03F (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>E). In these two experiments, the wick again appeared to have the greatest variance from other components. Leaf, root, and substrate were more similar.

There were few genera common to all four components in each of the three technical demonstrations, (VEG-03D, E, F) and ranged between one and nine genera. VEG-03D green leaf lettuce plant and pillow samples had the highest number of shared genera with nine (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A). In all three tech demos the wick component revealed a high number of unique genera between 2–19; the highest number of unique genera occurring in VEG-03E mizuna mustard pillow wicks (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>B). </p>
                <p><xref rid="life-11-01060-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>A illustrates a high number of genera shared between wick, substrate, and root tissue in VEG-03D with 26 in mizuna, 22 and 31 in red romaine lettuce, and 27 in green leaf lettuce.

                <p>Root tissue had few unique genera, but in all crops the root had high numbers of shared genera with substrate (6–28) and between root, substrate, and wick (22–31) which included more than 40% of the genera present (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).

                <p>Overall, characterization of genera in the four plant and pillow components revealed few unique species in each of the components but indicated a higher number of shared species especially among root, substrate, and wick (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
                <p>A closer inspection of the top community constituents revealed that variations in the bacterial makeup between pillow sections (wick, substrate, and root) differed from the leaf tissue (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>, <xref rid="life-11-01060-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> and <xref rid="life-11-01060-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>). VEG-03D which included analysis of all three leafy green crops grown yielded several bacterial constituents seen in all plant types (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>).

                <p>The VEG-03E samples and pillows returned from ISS were mizuna mustard (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f011" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>) while VEG-03F were red romaine lettuce (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f012" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref>).

              <p>The Veggie plant growth units deployed on the ISS have provided a platform to grow leafy greens for astronaut consumption since 2014. This series of tech demonstrations was the first time that mixed cropping was tested in Veggie, with three leafy greens. Plant growth was successful, however, there may have been an influence on growth based on plant type and position in the Veggie. It was observed in VEG 03-D that the mizuna canopy shaded the adjacent red romaine lettuce plant possibly limiting exposure to light and effecting maintenance. Germination was lower with the green leaf lettuce resulting in fewer and smaller plants. Mixed cropping could also have an impact on the transfer of plant-specific phyllosphere microbiota between crop types [<xref rid="B14-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B16-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
              <p>Microbiological food safety of Veggie-grown crops is assured by routine culture-based pathogen screening and bacterial and fungal enumeration on crops grown in ground analogs as well as samples returned from ISS. The bacterial and fungal count data and pathogen screening performed on the plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F indicates from a microbial food safety perspective, the crops are low risk to the crew. With approximately 10% of a microbial community identified with culturable methods, sequencing of both bacterial and fungal constituents provides additional identification of the community microbiota [<xref rid="B42-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These data allow for the identification of the non-culturable microbes including the identification of beneficial microbes and microbes of concern and the confirmation of the negative culture-based screening results for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>. Many of the genera isolated and identified from the Veggie plant phyllosphere are present in terrestrially grown leafy greens. Several surveys of leafy greens revealed that <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas</italic> species dominate the phyllosphere.

              <p>Bacterial counts (CFU/g) from field and hydroponic grown lettuce have been reported in the range of 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> and fungal counts (CFU/g) between 8 × 10<sup>2</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> [<xref rid="B43-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The bacterial and fungal counts on leaves of plants grown in VEG-03D, E, and F were in the range of the reported values for farm or market produce counts of similar type. However, when compared to the analysis of red romaine lettuce from previous Veggie tech demos [<xref rid="B28-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the bacterial and fungal counts per gram of red romaine lettuce leaf tissue from VEG-03D and F were higher.

VEG-03A and VEG-03D were run in the same Veggie facility (SN 002) and during plant growth, in both cases, the humidity was higher than other grow-outs. Humidity is a factor that can influence the microbial density and community in the phyllosphere and the surface of the leaf. It has been demonstrated that higher humidity and leaf wetness increases fungal abundance on plants including fungal plant pathogens [<xref rid="B29-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B52-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. </p>
              <p>The characterization of the spatial distribution of microbiota on the Veggie facility surfaces, plant growth pillows, and multi-species plant tissues was performed to elucidate possible sources and routes of transfer of microbes around the Veggie facility and plants. Generally, surface sample microbial count data showed low counts on the interior bellows surfaces, and below detection level counts mostly in VEG-03E. After harvest, the bellows are cleaned thoroughly by the crew with disinfectant wipes, perhaps minimizing microbial proliferation. The pillow surfaces had the highest counts of all surfaces sampled and are in close proximity with the moist wicking material, the plant and any plant debris which could facilitate inoculation and growth. Bacteria and fungi were recovered from the fan screen in all cases. The genera of bacteria and fungi cultured and identified have also been identified in studies to monitor the microbial profiles of the ISS. <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Pantoea</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Penicillium</italic> were all identified in an examination of ISS air filters and dust samples [<xref rid="B54-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

In addition, studies done on the microbial communities associated with surfaces on the ISS identify many of the same genera identified from the Veggie surface samples collected in this study [<xref rid="B30-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

The leaves, Veggie surfaces and ISS samples had 47 common genera suggesting microbial transfer and colonization between these locations (<xref rid="app1-life-11-01060" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Beta diversity analysis of all plants grown in the three tech demos resulted in a tight clustering of plants from VEG-03D with the exception of one green lettuce leaf demonstrating similarity of the microbial communities within VEG-03D. VEG-03E and F grown later do not cluster tightly indicating potential diversity differences (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). These differences could be the result of many factors, including the different configuration of the three crops in each Veggie, the environmental conditions present at the time of the grow-out, i.e., temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> and humidity, crew interaction, microbes present in the surrounding air, and irrigation water. Previous studies on field-grown leafy greens have shown that seasonal and temporal variation exists on the phyllosphere microbial communities, effected by leaf age, weather, location and soil type [<xref rid="B14-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B57-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
              <p>Unlike terrestrial agriculture, a sanitized, soilless substrate is used in Veggie to support root growth. It is aseptically packed into sterile “pillows” along with controlled release fertilizer [<xref rid="B34-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The seeds are surface sanitized before planting, removing most epiphytes from the seed surface, and the water used to hydrate the plant pillows is relatively clean water from the ISS potable water system [<xref rid="B35-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B58-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Consequently, the horticultural practices employed in Veggie may limit the sources of microbiota contributing to the development of the plant microbiome. As a whole, the phytomicrobiome is shaped and recruited by the plant from its associated habitat [<xref rid="B3-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B59-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Rhizosphere microbiomes assemble through the selection of soil microorganisms by the production of plant root exudates [<xref rid="B60-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The Veggie soilless substrate is essentially microbe free until the introduction of water, seed germination and exposure to the ISS environment. Water and air from the ISS have been monitored by NASA for many years and two genera commonly identified from the potable water are <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ralstonia</italic> [<xref rid="B58-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B63-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The dominant bacterial genera in Veggie samples analyzed in this study, <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic>, was found across plant types and Veggie facility materials in both culture and molecular assays. The genus <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic> contains over 60 known species and was abundant in many of the Veggie samples, primarily in the pillow substrate, root tissue, and wicks, but in very low abundance or was absent in leaf tissue indicating the genus may have been introduced through the water source or possibly was present in the seed. <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic> has been identified as a potential, beneficial plant-associated microbe, however some species are implicated in human opportunistic infections [<xref rid="B21-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B64-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] <italic toggle="yes">Ralstonia</italic>, also found in ISS water, was identified in community sequencing across all plant type roots, wicks, and substrate. Some species of <italic toggle="yes">Ralstonia</italic> have the potential to cause stress in plants or may be an opportunistic pathogen [<xref rid="B66-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B68-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas</italic> sp., present in the top 15 genera in community sequencing in all samples but one mizuna plant and pillow from VEG-03E may be a saprophytic epi-endophyte on plant tissue [<xref rid="B16-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B64-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B69-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="B71-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It has been reported to be a potential promotor of plant growth by producing plant stimulating hormones as well as increasing disease resistance [<xref rid="B71-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. These demonstrations, D and F were completed in the same Veggie unit, SN 002, and therefore not surprising that similar microbes would be detected. Several genera were identified by sequencing in VEG-03D and F but not in E. The genera <italic toggle="yes">Enterobacter</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Chitinophaga</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Novosphingobium</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Bradyrhizobium</italic> are a few that were identified in all of the Veg-03D samples as well as some of the VEG-03F samples. <italic toggle="yes">Chitinophaga</italic> sp., works with certain fungal species as an endosymbiont to enhance nutrient uptake and growth [<xref rid="B66-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B72-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The presence of <italic toggle="yes">Chitinophaga</italic> could be correlated with stress conditions and environmental disturbances [<xref rid="B66-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B72-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In VEG-03D <italic toggle="yes">Methylobacterium</italic> was identified in red romaine and mizuna while <italic toggle="yes">Janthinobacterium</italic> was isolated in red romaine only. Recently it was reported that 4 strains of <italic toggle="yes">Methylobacterium</italic>, one a newly characterized strain, were isolated on the ISS with the Microbial Monitoring experiments [<xref rid="B73-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Methylobacterium</italic> are involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol activity against plant pathogens [<xref rid="B74-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and is a methylotrophic with the ability to utilize methanol produced by plants as a carbon source [<xref rid="B76-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] <italic toggle="yes">Janthinobacterium</italic> is a soil bacterium with a wide range of metabolic activities, including antimicrobial properties and resistance to stressors such as UV radiation and cold temperatures providing a benefit to plants [<xref rid="B77-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. During the grow outs of VEG-03E and F, the genera <italic toggle="yes">Nevskia</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Spirosoma</italic> were present in VEG-03E but not seen in VEG-03F. This could be due to a natural variation between mizuna and red romaine lettuce as each plant may have its own native microbiota, or it may have been introduced. These bacteria were detected in root and leaf samples from previous Veggie tech demos, VEG-01A, B and VEG-03A [<xref rid="B28-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. If the source of these bacteria is the water initially introduced into the soilless substrate and subsequently wicked to the seeds, this suggests possible mechanisms of transfer of water borne bacteria from the seed to the root or recruitment by the root from the surrounding substrate. An in-depth genomic analysis would have to be performed to elucidate possible sources of microbial transfer.</p>
              <p>All the bacteria cultured and identified from root samples, <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Flavomonas</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Leifsonia</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Methylobacterium</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Microbacterium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rhizobium</italic> were also identified in the wick samples. Presumably, the sources of these bacteria are the ISS water, the endophytic seed population, circulating air, and/or human interaction with the plants, therefore diversity of the root microbiome could be limited by the populations in these sources. Eleven of the 12 identified isolates found on the leaf samples were not isolated from the roots, in corroboration with the 16S rRNA analysis of community comparison which revealed no shared species between the leaf and root. In the culture-based assays, 6 of the leaf-isolated bacteria were also found on the wicks. Different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities [<xref rid="B80-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Patterns of genera common across the substrate, root, wicks, and leaves suggest alternate modes of bacterial and fungal transmission. For example, the substrate, roots, and wicks share the highest number of genera for all pillow sample sets tested while the leaves share a higher number of genera with the wicking material (<xref rid="life-11-01060-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). This suggests the possibility of horizontal transfer of bacteria from substrate to root or the converse. The substrate starts as a sterile matrix therefore the introduction of microbes could be primarily limited to the ISS potable water, microbes within the ISS, those harbored on the Veggie surfaces, or the endophytic seed microbiota. The seed microbiome of two of the three crops, red romaine lettuce and mizuna mustard, have been investigated at KSC in numerous studies since the inception of the Veggie technology demonstrations. The microbiome of both sanitized and unsanitized seeds indicated that in all seeds, abundance of microbial communities/genera was low and the genus <italic toggle="yes">Thermogemmatispora</italic> predominated, and then declined post-germination., In addition, <italic toggle="yes">Trichodesmium</italic> and some genera of cyanobacteria were detected along with low abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Corynebacterium</italic>. These latter three appear to persist in the plants after germination [<xref rid="B82-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Very few genera are shared between the leaf and substrate and the leaf and root whereas the wick has more genera in common with the leaf than the substrate and root, indicating a vertical transfer from the above “ground” wick material and the shoot of the plant. Resident microbial populations on the leaf may be transported from the ISS environment, including the circulating air and human interaction. Human associated <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> was identified on the leaves, surfaces, and wicks from cultured isolates and for 16S community sequencing, it was the dominant bacteria among the top 15 identified in one VEG-03E mizuna leaf sample. Other potential human and plant associated bacterial genera identified were <italic toggle="yes">Erwinia, Burkholderia</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Clavibacter.</italic> Extensive genotyping of these isolates would be required to evaluate the strain and the ability to infect the host.</p>
              <p>Four of the fungal species identified, <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> spp., <italic toggle="yes">Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Penicillium</italic> spp., <italic toggle="yes">Rhodotorula</italic> spp. were found in all tech demos. In previous studies of Veggie-grown plants, <italic toggle="yes">Fusarium oxysporum</italic> was not found on the first growth of lettuce or surfaces of Veggie from the tech demo designated VEG-01A but has since been isolated in all subsequent tech demos [<xref rid="B28-life-11-01060" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (unpublished data). This suggests that once bacteria or fungi become established in Veggie units and the ISS environment, unless eliminated by the cleaning and maintenance protocols, they could persist as members of the facility microbiome and consequently the plant microbiome.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, characterization of the microbiome of ISS plant growth systems and crops is critical, not only for near term assurance of crop food safety, but also for the understanding and development of sustainable crop systems for space exploration missions. Sources of external contamination, i.e., irrigation water, air, and human handling can be monitored and controlled. Strategies, such as the introduction of defined beneficial microbes to enhance plant growth and prevent human and plant pathogen invaders may need to be evaluated and implemented after careful study of the impact to these unique space agricultural systems.</p>
