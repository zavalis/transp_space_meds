                <p id="Par1">The heterotrimeric flavin adenine dinucleotide dependent glucose dehydrogenase is a promising enzyme for direct electron transfer (DET) principle-based glucose sensors within continuous glucose monitoring systems. We elucidate the structure of the subunit interface of this enzyme by preparing heterotrimer complex protein crystals grown under a space microgravity environment. Based on the proposed structure, we introduce inter-subunit disulfide bonds between the small and electron transfer subunits (5 pairs), as well as the catalytic and the electron transfer subunits (9 pairs). Without compromising the enzyme’s catalytic efficiency, a mutant enzyme harboring Pro205Cys in the catalytic subunit, Asp383Cys and Tyr349Cys in the electron transfer subunit, and Lys155Cys in the small subunit, is determined to be the most stable of the variants. The developed engineered enzyme demonstrate a higher catalytic activity and DET ability than the wild type. This mutant retains its full activity below 70 °C as well as after incubation at 75 °C for 15 min – much higher temperatures than the current gold standard enzyme, glucose oxidase, is capable of withstanding.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Technological developments with respect to electrochemical glucose sensors are largely dependent on the continued innovation of the capabilities of glucose-sensing enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Three different electrochemical sensing principles for enzymatic glucose sensors have been reported: first-generation sensors utilize oxygen as an electron acceptor; second-generation sensors employ artificial electron acceptors or mediators; and third-generation sensors use neither oxygen nor mediators, but rather electrons can transfer directly to the electrode surface from the enzyme. Glucose sensors that are currently on the commercial market for diabetes management, such as disposable sensor strips for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and implantable sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, employ first- and second-generation principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Generally, these electrochemical sensors are developed by utilizing glucose oxidase (GOx) (β-D-glucose:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> or various glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) which possess either nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD), nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) or flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as their cognate redox cofactors. GDHs harboring FAD (FADGDH) as their redox cofactor can be divided into three distinct groups according to their origin: bacterial, fungal, and insect. Considering the substrate specificity and availability of various electron mediators, fungi-derived FADGDHs are currently the most popular enzymes for use in sensor strips in second-generation SMBG sensors. Commercially available electrochemical implantable sensors for CGM systems rely on first- or second-generation principles, and they all utilize GOx, mainly due to its inherent stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Third generation glucose sensors, which employ a glucose oxidizing enzyme capable of direct electron transfer (DET) with the electrode, are ideal for CGM systems compared to first- and second-generation sensors because of several key advantages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, the availability of glucose oxidoreductases inherently capable of DET is limited. One of the most prominent GDHs capable of DET is the bacteria-derived FADGDH complex, with the first reported example derived from <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> (BcGDH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. BcGDH is a glucose oxidoreductase with dye-mediated dehydrogenase activity, but lacks oxidase activity since it is unable to utilize oxygen as an electrode acceptor. The DET ability of this enzyme was first demonstrated by immobilizing the enzyme with carbon paste to an electrode in the absence of any additional electron acceptor, and the catalytic current responded in a glucose concentration-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Since then, various DET-type biodevices have been reported using BcGDH, such as enzyme fuel cell-based sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, BioCapacitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, amperometirc sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, open circuit potential based sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and impedimetric sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Bacteria-derived FADGDH complexes are composed of three distinct subunits: a catalytic subunit harboring an FAD cofactor in its catalytic center with an iron sulfur cluster (Fe-S; 3Fe-4S) as the primary electron acceptor of FAD, a small subunit which is a hitch-hiker protein necessary for the bacterial TAT secretion system, and an electron transfer subunit harboring three heme <italic>c</italic> units. This enzyme can transfer electrons liberated from glucose oxidation directly to the electrode without any redox mediator as a consequence of the architecture of the electron transfer subunit. The electron transfer subunit is required for DET, and followingly, the dissociation of the electron transfer subunit eliminates BcGDH’s DET ability. For BcGDH to be suitable for CGM systems, destabilization of the quaternary structure of BcGDH, specifically the dissociation of the electron transfer subunit from the catalytic subunit conjugated with the small subunit through a disulfide bond, should be prevented.</p>
              <p id="Par5">We recently reported the crystal structure of the BcGDH catalytic and small subunit complex (PDB:6a2u)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Through structural analysis, an intrinsic disulfide bond between the catalytic (Cys213) and small subunit (Cys152) was determined. The cysteine residue forming the disulfide bond in the catalytic subunit is located in proximity to the cysteine residues which form the Fe-S cluster. In the structure of the catalytic/small subunit complex, the Fe-S cluster and this disulfide bond are located at the surface of the catalytic subunit. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the cysteine residue which forms the disulfide bond between catalytic and small subunits is critical for stability at high temperatures, whereas catalytic activity of the mutant was comparable to the wild type at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. From this observation, we concluded that the intrinsic disulfide bond between the catalytic and small subunits in BcGDH might stabilize the catalytic subunit, especially its Fe-S cluster.</p>
              <p id="Par6">We also reported previously that chemical crosslinking of BcGDH with glutaraldehyde improved its thermal stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This observation suggested that quaternary structure stabilization may be achieved via the construction of a stable BcGDH complex harboring an electron transfer subunit. However, the rate of chemical crosslinking processes is difficult to control and random modification of residues can occur, which could result in a decrease in catalytic activity or change in DET ability. A more reliable method to stabilize the quaternary structure of this enzyme would be to introduce disulfide bonds among the residues of its inter-subunit regions: either between the catalytic and electron transfer subunits and/or the small and electron transfer subunits. We hypothesize that these disulfide bonds—in addition to the intrinsic disulfide bond between the catalytic and small subunits—will improve enzyme stability without compromising its catalytic activity or DET ability. However, the crystal structure of a BcGDH complex with an electron transfer subunit, or any homologous FAD-dependent dehydrogenase complex harboring multiple heme <italic>c</italic> electron transfer subunits, has yet to be elucidated, making it a challenge to design such disulfide bonds. The nature of these enzymes proves crystal formation difficult: FAD-dependent dehydrogenase complexes are membrane-bound hydrophobic enzymes and also form heterogeneous complexes in solution.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been conducting High-quality Protein Crystal Growth experiments (JAXA PCG) in the Japanese Kibo module on the International Space Station (ISS). Owing to the unique environment in space where there is no convection to disrupt liquid solution nor precipitation causing heavier molecules to sink, many crystals of various proteins have been successfully created in this way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To improve the stability of the DET-type FADGDH complex via quaternary structure engineering, we elucidated the partial structure of this enzyme complex by preparing a protein crystal of BcGDH heterotrimer complex in space through JAXA PCG experiments. Utilizing the provisional crystal structure containing a partial structure of the third heme <italic>c</italic>, within the electron transfer subunit, which is the primary electron acceptor of the iron sulfur cluster in the catalytic subunit, we constructed a structural model showing the putative inter-subunit region. Based on the structural model, 14 candidate amino acid residues were selected to form disulfide bond pairs between the small and electron transfer subunits (5 pairs), as well as the catalytic and electron transfer subunits (9 pairs).</p>
              <p id="Par8">The engineering of BcGDH resulted in enzyme super-stabilization: the constructed mutant did not lose activity for at least 30 minutes in solution at 70 °C, making its thermal stability much higher than GOx. Surprisingly, the mutant enzyme showed 70% higher catalytic efficiency compared with the control BcGDH. We conjecture that this phenomenon is attributed to the disulfide bond formation which shortens the distance between the catalytic subunit and electron transfer subunit, and also possible contribution of disulfide bond to foster inter-molecular electron transfer. Electrochemical evaluation of enzyme-functionalized electrodes with the mutant BcGDH confirmed its DET ability, with a higher current density than those electrodes with control BcGDH alone. This DET-type FADGDH with engineered quaternary structure, based on the structural information obtained from crystals grown in a space microgravity environment, is a promising enzyme candidate for future third-generation CGM systems.</p>

                <p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the proposed structure of a BcGDH complex composed of the catalytic, small, and third heme <italic>c</italic> region of the electron transfer subunit; hereafter, α denotes the catalytic subunit, γ denotes the small subunit, and β denotes the electron transfer subunit. The proposed structure is modeled based on X-ray diffraction data analyses of the BcGDH complex crystal grown using the crystallization facility of JAXA on board the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo on the ISS. Through electron density analysis, a partial structure of the electron transfer subunit from βLeu314 to the C-terminal end colored in pink (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) was determined, containing the third heme <italic>c</italic>. Two helices (helix<sub>1</sub> and helix<sub>2</sub>) and two regions colored with magenta (βCys334 to βThr358 and βIle384 to βAsn394) surround the third heme <italic>c</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). βHis338 and βMet386 are predicted as the two axial ligands of the heme iron, and each ligand is located at the above mentioned two colored-regions with magenta. Heme is covalently bound to the enzyme via two cysteine residues (βCys334 and βCys337), which is typical of heme binding motifs, CXXCH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The overall structure revealed the third heme <italic>c</italic> region of the electron transfer subunit interacts with both catalytic and small subunits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The thioether end of the third heme <italic>c</italic> is oriented to the Fe-S cluster, and the region from βCys334 to βThr358, colored with magenta including the heme binding motif, interacts with the small subunit colored with cyan. This region is close to the intrinsic disulfide bond formed between αC213 and γC152. The catalytic subunit colored with green mainly interacts with the region between helix<sub>1</sub> and helix<sub>2</sub> and includes the colored-region in magenta (βIle384 to βAsn394), where the sixth ligand (βM386) of the third heme is located. From the overall complex structure, the location of each cofactor and their distances were estimated. The edge-to-edge distance between the third heme <italic>c</italic> and the 3Fe-4S in the catalytic subunit is 7~8 Å. Because of this short distance, it is expected electrons are directly transferred between the 3Fe-4S of the catalytic subunit to the third heme <italic>c</italic> in the electron transfer subunit.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Structure model of BcGDH heterotrimer complex.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Overall structure of the constructed model based on crystal structure analysis.

This mutant demonstrated the highest residual activity, retaining more than 70% of its initial activity after heat treatment at 65 °C for 15 min (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). αG208C/βG385C and αE235C/βY391C also showed improved thermal stability (&gt;25%).

                <p id="Par14">These results indicate that most of the designed disulfide bonds based on the predicted model of BcGDH correctly formed and contributed to constructing an engineered BcGDH with increased thermal stability.

We constructed a multi-mutant complex in which we combined the disulfide bonds designed between small/electron transfer subunits and catalytic/electron transfer subunits, by combining αP205C/βD383C and γK155C/βY349C. The crude enzyme sample of the designed mutant with two additional disulfide bonds showed the highest thermal stability of the constructed mutants in this study. However, the enzyme activity of αP205C/βD383C-γK155C/βY349C shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> is 2.66 U  mg<sup>−1</sup>, whereas the control enzyme activity is 9.08 U mg<sup>−1</sup>; the mutant enzyme demonstrates only 30% activity of the control enzyme. However, as these values were obtained from measurement of crude enzyme samples, these values were affected by the expression level of each preparation. The expression level of the control enzyme is much higher than the mutant αP205C/βD383C-γK155C/βY349C (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>; uncropped and unedited gel images are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Therefore, the lower catalytic activity observed is due to the relatively low expression level of the mutant enzyme in this sample preparation. The enzyme was not inactivated during incubation at 65 °C for 15 min, but it increased (162%), likely due to the appropriate conformational formation during thermal treatment.

              <p id="Par21">In this study, we stabilized the DET-type FADGDH complex, BcGDH, through quaternary structure engineering by introducing disulfide bonds between the catalytic and electron transfer subunits, and between the small and electron transfer subunits. Disulfide bonds were designed based on the solved partial structure of this enzyme complex through preparing a protein crystal of BcGDH heterotrimer complex in space under JAXA PCG experiments, and by constructing a structural model showing the putative inter-subunit region. Our engineered BcGDH demonstrated improved thermal stability as well as increased catalytic and DET activity.</p>
              <p id="Par22">To elucidate the quaternary structure of BcGDH heterotrimer complex, we first investigated crystallization in laboratory conditions, but we could not obtain any crystals which yielded sufficient diffraction for structural analysis. Therefore, we joined the JAXA program to crystallize BcGDH. The effect of suppressing convection in liquid solution in microgravity crystallization has been reported by JAXA and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In microgravity environments, high-quality protein crystals without cracks caused by convection can be obtained which result in nice diffraction with low mosaicity for structural analysis. Many participants in JAXA’s program were able to obtain crystals with improved qualities and have reported structural analyses with higher resolution compared to their crystals grown on the ground.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Based on our structure model of the BcGDH complex obtained based on X-ray diffraction analyses, some salt bridges (βR315-γE134, βR315-αE50, and βR328-αE50) are likely formed in the N-terminal region of the β subunit (from βR315 to L331 colored with pink in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). In addition, the N-terminal region of the β subunit likely forms hydrogen bonds with γ and α subunits between the carbonyl oxygen of βR315 and NH1 of γR78, the carbonyl oxygen of βV317 and ND2 of αN54, and the carbonyl oxygen of βL331 and NH1 of αR53. αP210 and αI224 of α subunit create a hydrophobic environment together with the hydrophobic residues of the β subunit (βP351, βL353, βV359, βL367, βV370, βI371, βV375, βP387, and βF389) and surround the third heme <italic>c</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par24">We previously reported a BcGDH mutagenesis study, which predicted the third heme <italic>c</italic> domain as the first electron acceptor in the electron transfer subunit from the catalytic domain via the iron-sulfur cluster as the electron donor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This characteristic study also supports that the position of the third heme is structurally close to catalytic subunit. In addition to this, we characterized a BcGDH complex harboring a truncated electron transfer subunit, which only contains a third heme domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The truncated mutant retained full enzymatic and DET activity, suggesting the third heme is the first and only electron acceptor from the catalytic subunit. Taken together, these two biochemical observations indicate that the interaction between the third heme region in the electron transfer subunit and the other two subunits dominates the structural stability of an enzyme complex capable of DET. Accordingly, we reasoned that introducing disulfide bonds between the third heme region of the electron transfer subunit and the catalytic subunit and/or small subunit would enhance the quaternary structure necessary for DET.</p>
              <p id="Par25">We also predicted the structure of the BcGDH complex by AlphaFold-Multimer (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The predicted structure revealed that only the third heme region in the electron transfer subunit interacts with the catalytic and small subunit.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Based on our biochemical data and the AlphaFold-Multimer structural prediction, we concluded our strategy to introduce disulfide bonds between the third heme region in the electron transfer subunit and the catalytic subunit and/or small subunit, was adequate, without considering additional interactions.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Our strategy to design and introduce disulfide bonds in the inter-subunit region was to avoid subunit dissociation while retaining its active quaternary structure demonstrating DET ability. The introduction of additional four cysteine residues in the selected mutant (αP205C/βD383C-γK155C/βY349C), did not negatively impact the catalytic activity (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) nor the recombinant preparation of this enzyme compared to the control (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>; mutant (αP205C/βD383C- γK155C/ βY349C); crude sample 3656 U/L culture, purified 282 U/L culture, control; crude sample 3092 U/L culture, purified 38 U/L culture). These results indicate that the additional disulfide bonds between subunits did not result in improper protein folding or an adverse structural change.</p>
              <p id="Par28">We believe our strategy is applicable for several enzyme complexes composed of multi-subunits, such as homologue enzyme complexes of BcGDH, fructose dehydrogenase (EC1.1.5.14), and 2-ketogluconate dehydrogenase (EC1.1.99.3). These enzymes form quaternary structures, and each is composed of a catalytic subunit harboring an FAD cofactor in its catalytic center with an iron sulfur cluster (Fe-S; 3Fe-4S) as the primary electron acceptor of FAD, a small subunit which is a hitch-hiker protein necessary for the bacterial TAT secretion system, and an electron transfer subunit harboring three heme <italic>c</italic> units.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The most stable BcGDH mutant, αP205C/βD383C-γK155C/βY349C, was not inactivated at temperatures below 70 °C and maintained activity even after incubation at 75 °C for 15 min. The mutant enzyme proved to have a higher thermal stability than the control BcGDH and the current commercially utilized enzyme, GOx. These results supported our hypothesis that the introduction of disulfide bonds within these three subunits enhances thermal stability. Our previous studies on introducing intra-molecular disulfide bonds in fungi-derived FADGDH resulted in values of 6.1 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and 43 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> for ΔΔG<sup>‡</sup> and ΔΔH<sup>‡</sup>, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Considering that introducing inter-subunit disulfide bonds resulted in a ΔΔG<sup>‡</sup> value of 40.3 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> and a ΔΔH<sup>‡</sup> value of 187.9 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>, these results clearly indicate that the stabilization of quaternary structure through introducing two inter-subunit disulfide bonds, rather than intra-molecular disulfide bonds, significantly improved the enzyme stability.</p>
              <p id="Par30">The thermal stabilities and other enzymatic properties of reported thermally stable glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs) are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The most thermostable GDH was reported from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, <italic>Thermoproteus</italic> sp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition to this, several GDHs were reported from thermophilic bacteria and archeons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, these GDHs are NAD(P)-dependent enzymes which lack DET ability and are not suitable for the construction of continuous monitoring systems. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-bound GDHs were also reported from hypertheromophillic archeons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, however, these enzymes exhibit broad substrate specificity as well as show low catalytic efficiency towards glucose. We previously reported the quaternary structure engineering of PQQGDH derived from a mesophile (<italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic>), which is a homo-dimeric enzyme. By introducing a disulfide bond in the inter-subunit region, hyper-thermal stabilization was achieved without loss of catalytic efficiency, which is comparable with this study. The improvement of substrate specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and addition of DET ability of PQQGDH were also reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, however, the combination of these engineering approaches is yet to be achieved to make PQQGDH suitable for CGM system. A limiting issue with PQQGDH is its redox cofactor. PQQ is not covalently bound to the enzyme and can form an apoenzyme during continuous operation. Fungi-derived thermostable enzymes have also been reported. Introducing intra-disulfide bonds to FADGDH enabled the construction of thermally stable enzyme. While several thermostable FADGDHs from fungi have been described, these FADGDHs do not have DET ability. Although a recent report outlined the construction of fungi-derived DET-FADGDH through the fusion of heme-<italic>b</italic> domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, its DET abilities are inferior to the BcGDH. Therefore, among currently available glucose oxidoreductases, the quaternary structure engineered BcGDH is the most stable enzyme for use in CGM.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>The thermal stabilities and other enzymatic properties of reported thermally stable glucose dehydrogenases (GDHs).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>EC</th><th>Organism</th><th>Km</th><th><italic>k</italic>cat Vmax</th><th>melting temp (°C)</th><th>treatment temp (°C)</th><th colspan="2">Halflife</th><th>Ref.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="9">BcGDH wt</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"> 1.1.5.9</td><td rowspan="2"><italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic></td><td/><td/><td/><td>65</td><td>2.5 min</td><td rowspan="2">30 min, 10%</td><td rowspan="2"><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td>65</td><td>72 min (crosslinked)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="9"><italic>glucose 1-dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+]</italic></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="10">1.1.1.47</td><td><italic>Thermoproteus tenax</italic></td><td/><td>202 U mg<sup>−1</sup> specific</td><td/><td>103</td><td>10 min</td><td/><td><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic></td><td/><td>320 U mg<sup>−1</sup> specific</td><td/><td>75</td><td>3 h</td><td>catalytic activity is retained for 9 h at 55 °C</td><td><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic></td><td>293 mM</td><td>720 s<sup>−1</sup></td><td/><td>70</td><td/><td>30 min, 20%</td><td><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic></td><td>14 mM</td><td>395 s<sup>−1</sup></td><td>50.2</td><td/><td/><td/><td><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic></td><td>0.55 mM</td><td>11.4 U mg<sup>−1</sup></td><td/><td>65</td><td/><td>30 min, &gt;

              <p id="Par31">The catalytic current generated from the electrode with engineered BcGDH, αP205C/βD383C-γK155C/βY349C showed about 10 times higher catalytic current density than the control enzyme, which is much more than the ~2.5 times increase in the mutant’s catalytic activity (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). An inherent issue of DET-type enzymes is the dissociation of the electron transfer subunit during the electrode immobilization process, which results in a loss of DET ability. Since the electron transfer subunit of control BcGDH may spontaneously dissociate during SAM based immobilization, the predicted amount of successfully immobilized BcGDH with an electron transfer subunit would be less than that of a BcGDH solution. The introduction of inter-subunit disulfide bonds in engineered BcGDH may prevent the dissociation of the electron transfer subunit during SAM formation and consequently improve the yield of active DET BcGDH on the surface of electrode. Therefore, we postulate the increase in catalytic current from the electrode functionalized with engineered BcGDH is due to the increased stability of the enzyme during immobilization.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Disulfide bond introduction resulted not only in increased thermal stability of BcGDH quaternary structure, but also increased catalytic activity. There are two possible explanations for this observation; the inter-subunit distance between the catalytic and electron transfer subunit is shortened, and inter-molecular electron transfer is facilitated. First, the introduction of disulfide bonds reduces the distance between the Fe-S cluster in the catalytic subunit and heme <italic>c</italic> in the electron transfer subunit. The crystal structure revealed the distance between the Fe-S cluster and heme <italic>c</italic> to be 7.9 Å (shortest distance: S<sub>1</sub> in FeS to C<sub>BC</sub> in heme). The criteria to select residues for cysteine substitution was based on the observation that the combination of residues which exist between catalytic/electron transfer subunits or small/electron transfer subunits is ~5 Å between β-carbons (C<sub>β</sub>s); 5.8 Å for αP205C/βD383C and 5.0 Å for γK155C/βY349C. However, these observed distances are the values before disulfide bond formation. Considering the average distances between β-carbons after disulfide bond formation are &lt;5 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, formation of disulfide bonds between these residues might decrease the distance and fluctuation in distance between catalytic/electron transfer subunits and/or small/electron transfer subunits, bringing the Fe-S cluster in the catalytic subunit and heme <italic>c</italic> in the electron transfer subunit in closer proximity, consequently improving electron transfer efficiency and catalytic activity. Marcus theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> states the inverse of distance contributes to the reorientation energy, and the reorientation energy exponentially affects the electron transfer rate, suggesting that the effect of shortening the distance between redox centers on electron transfer is high.</p>
              <p id="Par33">The second possibility is the role of these newly formed disulfide bonds; they may serve as electron acceptors of the Fe-S cluster. It has been reported that the disulfide ring formed by adjacent cysteine residues in quinoprotein ethanol dehydrogenase (QEDH) serves an essential role for electron transfer from its cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) to cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>550</sub>, the natural electron acceptor of this enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. PQQ complexed with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is located in the superbarrel center and is embedded between a tryptophan residue and a ring structure formed from a disulfide bridge between adjacent cysteines Cys105 and Cys106<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. This disulfide ring near PQQ is found in all quinoprotein and quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenases and is essential for enzyme activity. Recently, redox activity of the disulfide ring in quinoprotein methanol dehydrogenase was confirmed, more specifically through its participation with the PQQ prosthetic group in electron transfer within the protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Considering the observations that disulfide bonds existing close to redox cofactors can serve as electron acceptors or electron donors, the newly formed disulfide bond in BcGDH, most probably in αP205C/βD383C, might serve as an additional redox-active molecule which facilitates electron transfer from the Fe-S cluster in the catalytic subunit and heme c in the electron transfer subunit and increases catalytic efficiency.</p>
              <p id="Par34">To consider BcGDH as a sensor constituent in CGM systems, the enzyme should maintain activity and specificity in complex biological samples. We have previously reported that enzyme electrodes employing BcGDH worked well not only in buffer solutions, but also in biological matrices utilized in continuous monitoring, such as artificial interstitial fluid (ISF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and artificial sweat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. It is also important to note that we utilized an engineered BcGDH with improved substrate specificity in this study, and the introduction of disulfide bonds did not negatively impact specificity (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In addition, the mutations introduced in this study were not deleterious to the enzyme’s catalytic properties. Taken together, these observations suggest a similar electrochemical performance of mutant BcGDH in pseudo-biological samples as those reported in buffer.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Introducing inter-subunit disulfide bonds within BcGDH stabilized its quaternary structure and resulted in an enzyme with high thermal stability. Furthermore, mutants constructed with two additional disulfide bonds demonstrated superior catalytic activity and catalytic current with electrochemical measurement. BcGDH is a highly remarkable enzyme in the biosensing field due to its DET ability. This mutant enzyme which exhibits high stability and high DET ability shows decided promise for application in future glucose sensing devices. Furthermore, this strategy for enzyme stabilization can be applied to other DET type enzymes.</p>

                <p id="Par39">Crystals of BcGDH were grown by utilizing the crystallization facilities of the JAPAN Aerospace Exploration in the Japanese Experiment Module “Kibo” at the International Space Station (ISS) under a high-quality protein crystal growth project (JAXA-PCG). In a microgravity environment at the ISS, the crystals were grown by counter-diffusion with the protein solution (5 mg/ml in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.03% (w/v) DDM) in a reservoir containing 2% (v/v) tacsimate, 16% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.03% (w/v) DDM and 100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.6 using the JCB-SGT device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>.

                <title>X-ray crystallography</title>
                <p id="Par40">X-ray diffraction data of a crystal of BcGDH were collected at 100 K using a PILATUS3 6 M detector at a wavelength of 1.0 Å on the BL41XU beam line in the SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). Diffraction data were processed using XDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> and CCP4 program suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The initial phases of BcGDH were obtained by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> with the structure of BcGDH small/catalytic subunits complex (PDB code: 6a2u). Although the electron density maps of a complex of BcGDH small/catalytic subunits and a part of the electron transfer subunit that attaches to BcGDH small/catalytic subunits complex are visible, the entire electron transfer subunit was not visible due to the weak and ambiguous electron density.</p>
                <p id="Par41">In the analysis of sequence similarity of electron transfer subunit of BcGDH by blast search, C-terminal region (Leu359-Arg456) of heme-Cu nitrite reductase from <italic>Ralstonia pickettie</italic> was raised up showing the similarity to the C-terminal 3rd heme <italic>c</italic> region (Leu329 to Arg425) of electron transfer subunit of BcGDH with 31% identity.

                <p id="Par42">A partial model building of the electron transfer subunit was then performed in the program Coot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>, and the structure was refined using the program Refmac5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. We used this partial constructed model of the electron transfer subunit for further investigation of engineering BcGDH. The finally refined structure was deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as 8HDD.

The activity was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance from DCIP at 600 nm and using the molar absorption coefficient of DCIP (16.3 mM cm<sup>−1</sup> at pH 7.0) to calculate enzyme activity. For the Ru/MTT method, the enzyme sample was incubated in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 77 mM hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride, 1 mM 3-(4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and 100 mM glucose. The activity was determined by monitoring the increase in absorbance from formazan at 565 nm and using the molar absorption coefficient of formazan (20 mM cm<sup>−1</sup> at pH 7.0). In each measurement method, one unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidizes 1 μmol of glucose per min.</p>
