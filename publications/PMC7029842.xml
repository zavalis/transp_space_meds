              <abstract>
                <p>The opportunistic pathogens <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia contaminans</italic>, both genomovars of the <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex (BCC), are frequently cultured from the potable water dispenser (PWD) of the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we sequenced the genomes and conducted phenotypic assays to characterize these <italic>Burkholderia</italic> isolates. All recovered isolates of the two species fall within monophyletic clades based on phylogenomic trees of conserved single-copy core genes. Within species, the ISS-derived isolates all demonstrate greater than 99% average nucleotide identity (with 95–99% of genomes aligning) and share around 90% of the identified gene clusters from a pangenomic analysis–suggesting that the two groups are each composed of highly similar genomic lineages and their members may have all stemmed from the same two founding populations. The differences that can be observed between the recovered isolates at the pangenomic level are primarily located within putative plasmids. Phenotypically, macrophage intracellularization and lysis occurred at generally similar rates between all ISS-derived isolates, as well as with their respective type-terrestrial strain references. All ISS-derived isolates exhibited antibiotic sensitivity similar to that of the terrestrial reference strains, and minimal differences between isolates were observed. With a few exceptions, biofilm formation rates were generally consistent across each species. And lastly, though isolation date does not necessarily provide any insight into how long a given isolate had been aboard the ISS, none of the assayed physiology correlated with either date of isolation or distances based on nucleotide variation. Overall, we find that while the populations of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> present in the ISS PWS each maintain virulence, they are likely are not more virulent than those that might be encountered on planet and remain susceptible to clinically used antibiotics.</p>

              <p>Microbial surveillance of the surfaces, air, and potable water system (PWS) of the International Space Station (ISS) has been implemented by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to ensure crew health within this unique closed environment. These efforts, which use standard culturing techniques, have been conducted over twelve years and 22 missions and began shortly after the potable water dispenser (PWD) was launched on STS-126 in November of 2008. On-orbit operations using the PWD began in early 2009 and continue to this day. The organisms <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic>, both genomovars of the <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex (BCC), have been frequently cultured from the PWD of the ISS. The isolates analyzed in the current study were collected between January 6, 2010 during mission 22 and August 6, 2014 during mission 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s004">S1 Table</xref>). The PWS in combination with the PWD is a water recycling system that utilizes physical and chemical techniques to filter, decontaminate, and sterilize water used for drinking and food hydration [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp. are known to withstand disinfection and sterilization procedures as they display a moderate to high-tolerance to stress such as UV-C radiation, antibiotics, and high heavy-metal concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>

              <p><italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp., among other bacterial contaminants, are likely to have been introduced into the PWD during unit assembly prior to launch [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>Burkholderia</italic> spp. are known to survive long periods in distilled water [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This ability to survive in distilled water with minimal additives has made them problematic for healthcare, as hospital-acquired BCC infections can arise from contaminated disinfectants, anesthetic solutions, distilled water, and aqueous chlorhexidine solutions [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The ISS PWD uses flushes of 40ppm elemental iodine for decontamination, followed by iodine removal by a deiodination filter before astronaut use [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some <italic>Burkholderia</italic> isolates have been found to be resistant to iodine and can even survive in iodine solutions [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], providing pre-observed phenotypes of this lineage that may be capable of maintaining a continued presence in the ISS PWD despite disinfection efforts.</p>
              <p><italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are known to propagate in both nutrient-poor and -rich soil environments, in addition to within human host cells [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They are commonly isolated from soil, plant rhizospheres, and water [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as from the sputum of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic infection [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. BCC members pose a significant threat to individuals with CF (accounting for 85% of all infections in CF patients [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) and otherwise immune-compromised patients due to an exacerbation of pulmonary infections, which can lead to morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The antibiotic resistance and intracellular survival capabilities of BCC members make them unamenable to many therapeutics in susceptible infected patients [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. BCC species are nearly indistinguishable from one another by biochemical testing because all members have large genomes ranging from 6-9Mb that harbor the potential for considerable plasticity and diversity within [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic>, however, can be distinguished by their yellow pigmentation and hemolytic quality [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CF infections with this species is the most prevalent in Spain, Portugal and the Ibero-American countries, whereas <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> infections are more prevalent in the Iberian Peninsula alone [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The genomes of BCC organisms can mutate rapidly during infections or when subjected to high-stress conditions [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the latter of which might be satisfied by the sequential iodine treatments of the PWD. The genus is known to have several mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which can promote the transfer and acquisition of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes; BCC organisms have genomic islands, such as the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> epidemic strain marker (BCESM), containing genes linked to virulence and metabolism, quorum sensing, transcriptional regulation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and transposition [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>The PWD unit of the ISS was assembled in a cleanroom facility and then primed on Earth using an extensive process to ensure no gas bubbles existed within the lines that could lock the apparatus upon installation in orbit. During build and delivery on planet, the system was maintained using a 20 to 30 ppm iodine and a 6% hydrogen peroxide solution flush [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The primed system sat dormant for 6 months before installation on the ISS [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Microbial surveillance was conducted on the system after installation and the bacterial load was 85 CFU/mL, which exceeded the 50 CFU/mL limits set for ISS potable water, leaving the sole source of water on the US module out-of-order [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], during which time the Russian system was used as a back-up. The US system was flushed with the biocide iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), first at what turned out to be a sub-inhibitory concentration of 4ppm, as subsequent measurements revealed an increase in the microbial load [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Further testing revealed that 40ppm was the necessary concentration of iodine flush to achieve the drinkable 50 CFU/mL maximum bacterial load [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Iodine flushes are still intermittently administered to the system after durations of PWD stagnation. Our focal <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species are known to survive not only in distilled water, but also in iodine solutions and resist reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide; therefore, these flushes may have reduced the overall microbial load of the PWD while inadvertently selecting for the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species within the system. Here we characterize genomic and phenotypic properties of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> isolates obtained from the ISS PWD.</p>

              <title>Results and discussion</title>
              <p>Twenty-four isolates were collected over 4.5 years from the PWD of the ISS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The genomes of these 24 ISS-PWD <italic>Burkholderia</italic> isolates were sequenced and <italic>de novo</italic> assembled with SPAdes v3.12.0 ([<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; isolate and assembly summary information in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s004">S1 Table</xref>). The recovered genomes within each species were all found to have an ANI of greater than 99% with 95–99.9% alignment in all cases (fastANI v1.2; [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), suggesting that they are each of highly similar genomic lineages and may have stemmed from the two distinct founding strains. This scenario has been observed previously in <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> infections where the initial colonization of affected patients was thought to be by an individual strain that subsequently diversified once in the host [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This has also been observed for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> as it adapts to the airways of cystic fibrosis patients where clones of cells experience selection which in turn accumulate genetic variants that help promote survival in the long-term [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An estimated maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of 203 single-copy genes specific to Betaproteobacteria was generated with GToTree v1.4.4 ([<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This placed 19 of the isolates within their own monophyletic clade within the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic>, and 5 within their own monophyletic clade within the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s001">S1 Fig</xref> for full tree). Single-nucleotide variant (SNV) trees (Parsnp v.1.2; [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) generated for each group of isolates revealed no clear groupings based on time of isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>; Mantel test <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.2). The <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> were isolated over the entire sampling period, while <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> were only isolated during 2013 and 2014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

                <title>Pangenomic analysis</title>
                <p>We performed a pangenomic analysis of each species first incorporating all assemblies available from NCBI (as accessed on 20-Aug-2019). Gene clusters (GCs) were identified with MCL clustering [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as employed within anvi’o v5.5 [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Across the incorporated 155 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> genomes (136 reference from NCBI and 19 derived from the ISS PWS), the average gene count was 7,461 ± 479 (mean ± 1SD; summarized in <xref rid="pone.0227152.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The MCL clustering approach yielded the identification of 25,383 total GCs: 2,589 with genes contributed by all (“core”; 10.2%); 8,249 with genes contributed by only single genomes (“singletons”; 32.5%); and 14,545 contributed by some mixture (“accessory”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). A total of 25 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> genomes were incorporated (20 references from NCBI and 5 ISS-isolates), with an average gene count of 7,580 ± 539. From these, a total of 13,645 GCs were generated: 3,534 core (25.9%); 3,436 singletons (25.2%); and 6,675 accessory GCs (49.0%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; summarized in <xref rid="pone.0227152.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It should be noted the disparity between the number of identified core, singleton, and accessory genes in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> versus those identified in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> at this point is not meant to convey anything about potential differences in gene-content diversity between the two species–as the number of genomes available/incorporated for each and the breadth of phylogenetic diversity spanned by the incorporated genomes of the two groups both vary greatly.</p>

It should be kept in mind that given the phylogenetic landscape of both ISS-derived groups–with each forming monophyletic clades within their respective species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s001">S1 Fig</xref>)–any functional differences observed may be simply due to evolutionary divergence as a whole, rather than being due to their source of isolation (the ISS). Of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> pangenome, this revealed no depleted functions (i.e. functional annotations a with signifanctly lower normalized abundance) in the ISS-derived isolates, and 8 functions enriched including those commonly associated with viruses and conjugative plasmids (<xref rid="pone.0227152.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; full results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s005">S2 Table</xref>).

                <p>As noted above, the recovered genomes within each species were all found to have an ANI of greater than 99% with 95–99.9% alignment in all cases, and each form monophyletic clades in relation to other members of their respective species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Pangenomic analyses incorporating solely the ISS-derived isolates revealed greater than 90% of the identified GCs having genes contributed from all genomes for both species, demonstrating the presence of highly conserved core genomes in each. For the 19 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates, 7,688 total GCs were generated: 7,065 core (91.9%); only 20 singletons (0.26%); and 603 accessory GCs (7.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g003">Fig 3</xref>, left side; summarized in <xref rid="pone.0227152.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the singleton GCs with functional annotations (5/20), most annotations were present in other GCs–meaning the sequences diverged enough to not cluster together, but were similar enough to be annotated the same way. The one exception was annotated by NCBI as an autotransporter domain-containing protein (from isolate s20, gene ID D7204_40525). For the 5 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> isolates, 7,778 GCs were generated: 7,509 core (96.5%); 163 singletons (2.1%); and 106 accessory GCs (1.4%; summarized in <xref rid="pone.0227152.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the 163 singleton GCs from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic>, 46 had annotations associated with them. Twenty-eight of these annotations were found in other GCs, while 18 were only annotated in one genome. Interestingly, 17 of these 18 all came from the same isolate s47, which was the first <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> isolate recovered from the ISS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1C</xref>); these functional annotations are presented in <xref rid="pone.0227152.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.

Wrapping around the circles are the generated gene clusters (GCs), where a solid mark for an isolate at a given GC indicates that particular isolate contributed a gene to that gene cluster, and the absence of a solid color indicates that isolate did not contribute a gene to that gene cluster. The very outer layer of each is a blue and yellow line. The blue line highlights core gene clusters. The yellow line highlights accessory GCs.

With a total of 475 GCs, only 3 had genes contributed from both genomes (0.6%), leaving the remaining 472 as singletons. Annotations from NCBI’s Clusters of Orthologous Genes (GOGs; [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]) of coding sequences from the putative plasmids reveal elements typical of conjugative plasmids, such as DNA replication proteins (DnaC), plasmid stabilization proteins (ParE), and Type IV secretion system components (T4SS; <xref rid="pone.0227152.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Additionally, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> putative plasmids contained a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which serves as a contamination indicator as it is able to breakdown polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and lysophospholipase, an enzyme known to be used by ingested bacteria to avoid phagocytosis by macrophage [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Despite containing this small conserved core, the larger plasmids in particular contain multiple copies of genes with annotations such as bacteriophage DNA transposition protein, AAA+ family ATPase (s9, s36, s39, s57), Virulence-associated protein-VagC (virulence associated gene C; s16, s28, s35, s36, s39), and additional elements of the T4SS, VirB8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s008">S5 Table</xref>). We additionally see transposase-related genes in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates with a mean copy number per putative plasmid of 17.57 ± 5.7 (mean ± 1 SD), and an integrase element with a mean copy number of 2.47 ± 0.51, suggesting DNA rearrangements and duplications among the conjugative plasmids of ISS <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> may be a result of these mobile genetic elements.</p>

                <p>As for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic>, in addition to harboring elements of both the T4SS and Type II secretion system (T2SS), the plasmids have a soluble lytic murein transglycosylase harboring a putative invasion domain LysM at a mean copy number of 3 ± 2.8. The lytic transglycosylase, LtgG, has recently reported for its role to control cell morphology and virulence in <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

                  <p>The largely coverage-based plasmidSPAdes [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] approach identified putative plasmids in all 19 of the ISS <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates. A pangenomic view of these putative plasmids for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> revealed a conserved functional core of elements including the T4SS VirD4 gene as well as a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and lysophospholipase (<xref rid="pone.0227152.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). As with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> harbor elements of the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) on putative plasmids as well as an enrichment of transposase-related genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0227152.s008">S5 Table</xref>). The observation that, within <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic>, transposase-related genes are present at a mean copy number of 17.57 ± 5.7 per putative-plasmid, along with an integrase element with mean copy number of 2.47 ± 0.51, provides a possible beneficial mechanism to be used by the bacteria when the population is under stress via promoting DNA rearrangement and duplications [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. T4SS mediate horizontal gene transfer, which contributes to genomic plasticity and possibly the evolution of pathogens through the spread of antibiotic resistance or virulence genes [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They are multi-subunit, cell-envelope-spanning structures consisting of a pilus and a secretion channel whereby DNA or protein is translocated outside of the cell to either another bacterial or host cell or to the surrounding environment. Furthermore, lysophospholipase is an enzyme that frees fatty acids from lysophospholipids (LPLs) and in turn generates cytotoxic LPLs. As a result, LPLs are considered to be virulence factors of bacteria as they are found to help bacteria escape phagosomes in host cells after a few rounds of intracellular multiplication [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The cytotoxicity they generate allows the bacteria to rupture out of a macrophage or epithelial cell, and in addition, destroy lung surfactant and generate signal transducers such as lysophosphatidylcholine, which in turn can induce inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, their plasmid-encoded genetic content suggests the potential for rapid adaptation, infection and cytotoxicity from these isolates.</p>
                  <p>Also found as a core gene in each plasmid is a catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O). The presence of such C23Os is commonly a water quality indicator [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. C23Os degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, as well the degreaser and common groundwater contaminant trichloroethylene (TCE). Toluene has been identified among the organic compounds found in the humidity condensate samples from the US Space Shuttle cabin [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The Shuttle did not use a water reclamation system, but the ISS does, as it reclaims water from urine and urine flush water, humidity condensate, personal hygiene water, and effluent from the crew health care systems. On a 1994 Shuttle mission, bags used to store urine samples for a Life Sciences experiment were giving off strong odors, and a post-flight assessment attributed this to the presence of volatile microbial metabolites which included 1,1,1-trichloroethane and toluene [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, trichloroethene (TCE) was found in one of two samples processed from the galley cold-water ports on Mir-21 [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in the range of 1.8–2.3 ug/L–the EPA has set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 5μg/L (5 ppb) in drinking water for TCE (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1985). Therefore, in the event that trace amounts of PAHs are present in the PWD, <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species maybe using C23Os to catabolize the compounds into usable carbon sources in order to facilitate their survival in the low-nutrient environment of the PWD of the ISS.</p>
                  <p>One potential selective pressure these isolates are exposed to is the intermittent dose of iodine which is used to disinfect the PWD. Alternatives to iodine have been considered for future PWD microbial disinfection, such as the use of silver in the form of silver (I) fluoride [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The effect of silver treatment upon <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> has been explored as a clinical alternative to antibiotics [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and will likely reduce this microbial load. However, we find that the ISS <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates analyzed in this study all harbored a Cu/Ag efflux pump (CusA) at a mean copy number of 3.05 ± 3.4 on a conjugative plasmid (<xref rid="pone.0227152.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Conjugative plasmids can be shared and could share the ability to pump silver out of an affected cell. Experimental designs testing the effects of the iodine disinfection process, and possibly how silver treatments may compare, would be of value moving forward. Our next steps would be to generate a transposon mutant library from an ISS isolate and subject the library to iodine and silver (I) fluoride treatments to investigate which genes may aid in survivorship.</p>

                  <p>Putative plasmids were also identified in 2 of the 5 ISS <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> isolates (s47 and s52). Both possess annotated T4SS and T2SS components as well as a soluble lytic murein transglycosylase harboring a putative invasion domain LysM at a mean copy number of 3 ± 2.83 (<xref rid="pone.0227152.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).

                  <p>The identification of putative virulence mechanisms within the ISS <italic>Burkholderia</italic> genomes led us to explore the ability for the ISS <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> isolates to invade and persist within macrophage in a cell culture. For reference, we have included two terrestrial strains from the same lineages (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> ATCC25416 and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> J2956). We note that while these are not “controls” as the ISS isolates were collected over time with no experimental design in place, and the source of these reference strains being terrestrially derived versus being derived from the ISS covaries with phylogenetic divergence from the ISS isolates, we include them as type strain references. We used two metrics for this assessment: 1) the ability of the bacteria to invade macrophage cells and be retained intracellularly, which allows for the bacteria to replicate without lysosomal degradation in turn lending to chronic infections; and 2) the ability for the bacteria to cause macrophage cell lysis as assessed by the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released by the cell. Such cell lysis in turn can trigger cytokine release and an inflammatory response. We present the cell counts for the intracellularized bacteria and LDH data for all ISS-derived isolates and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> J2956 and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> ATCC25416 reference strains. Macrophage cell lysis was quantified by the amount of LDH released in the cell culture media at six, eight, twelve and 24 hours post-inoculation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g005">5</xref>). Bacteria that were internalized by macrophage were quantified and reported in colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) measured at six and twelve hours post-inoculation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g007">7</xref>).</p>

The <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> ISS-derived isolates appear to be triggering cell lysis at generally similar rates to the terrestrial reference, though with high variability across the experimental triplicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g005">Fig 5</xref>). At twelve hours post-infection, the lysis trend exhibited for each isolate exists but at twice that of the magnitude of LDH released at eight hours post infection. When comparing only the ISS-derived isolates to each other, an ANOVA of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> LDH data by timepoint yielded a difference in means of the isolates for the 8-hour timepoint (<italic>p-</italic>value = 4e-04), and a subsequent Tukey HSD test revealed s37 to be greater than 11 isolates (s15, s16, s18, s20, s23, s24, s25, s35, s36, s39, and s41 at an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; = 0.04). Based on Mantel tests, LDH results of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> did not correlate with date of isolation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.27) or distances based on the SNV tree (p = 0.83). When comparing only the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> ISS-derived isolates to each other, an ANOVA of the LDH data by timepoint yielded no difference between the isolates (min <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.54), nor did LDH release correlate with date of isolation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.98; Mantel test) or distances based on the SNV tree (p = 0.21)</p>
                  <p>The macrophage intracellularization assay revealed no significant differences between ISS-derived isolates and their corresponding type-strain references (no adjusted <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 1 following Bonferonni correction; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g007">7</xref>). In comparing solely the ISS-derived isolate CFU/ml results to each other, an ANOVA of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates within each timepoint yielded a difference between isolates at the 6-hour timepoint (<italic>p</italic> = 6e-06), and a Tukey HSD test revealed s33 to be greater than all isolates other than s28 and s31, each at an adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; = 0.01. And Mantel tests revealed no correlation between CFUs and date of isolation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.28) or SNV tree distances (<italic>p</italic> = 0.81). When comparing solely the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> ISS-derived isolates against each other by timepoint via ANOVA, this returned a minimum p-value of 0.08.

                  <p>The included <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> ATCC25416 terrestrial reference strain has been noted for its ability to invade and carry out a long-term colonization of macrophage which can lend to the formation of long-term chronic infections [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, in our assay we find that although each ISS-derived <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolate is able to invade macrophage by 6 hours, they appear to multiply, then escape from the macrophage by 12 hours post-inoculation. Here they may be using the plasmid-encoded lysophospholipase mechanism to generate this lysis of macrophage. Despite not contributing to a longer-term infection, the cytotoxic byproducts generated by lysophospholipase degradation of macrophage may play a physiological role in further stimulating the adhesion and differentiation of lymphoid cells macrophages and activation and recruitment of additional macrophage and T-lymphocytes, among other immune response mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0227152.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> ATCC25416 terrestrial reference strain remained intracellularized at 12-hours post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g006">Fig 6</xref>) while still exhibiting the ability to lyse macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g004">Fig 4</xref>). <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> ISS-derived isolates and terrestrial reference strain, on the other hand, seem to exhibit a decreased rate of cellular invasion and a more immediate cell lysis of macrophage. This follows suit with the hemolytic and antifungal capabilities they also display, which is not characteristic of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates.</p>

              <p>Overall, within each species, the 19 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> and 5 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> recovered from the ISS PWD over roughly a 5-year timespan were highly similar on a whole genome scale, suggesting each population (here meaning one for each species) that was sampled from may have stemmed from two distinct founding strains. This is supported by all isolates demonstrating greater than 99% ANI with 95–99.9% alignment in all cases, and sharing a core pangenome of greater than 90% of identified gene clusters (within species). The vast majority of differences in gene-content that were identified in the pangenome were localized on putative plasmids. Physiologically, including antibiotic sensitivities, the ISS-derived isolates were overall generally similar to each other, as well as to the reference type-strains analyzed–excluding a few exceptions such as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> isolates s41 and s57 and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> s54 and s56 biofilm formation rates. In cases where ISS-derived isolates did vary, no strong correlations were found between physiology and either SNV distances or date of isolation (though it is also import to keep in mind date of isolation does not necessarily indicate any information about how long an isolate had been aboard the ISS). While it is interesting the 5 recovered <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> isolates were all isolated in a span of time over 2013 and 2014 during which no <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> were isolated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), we cannot speak to what may have caused this at this time (if anything). That aside, our analysis here suggests these two species’ populations sampled by way of isolation seem to be highly similar genetically regardless of date of isolation, with the majority of variation that does exist being maintained among putative plasmids. Based on the information presented here, it seems likely that the two populations of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> present in the ISS PWS are not more virulent than those that might be encountered on planet.</p>

                <p>Bacterial isolates from the ISS PWD were obtained by filtering sample from both the ambient and hot water outlets of the potable water system through a microbial capture device (MCD) on the ISS by resident astronauts. The MCD filter was then placed on R2A agar and the plates were sent back to Earth for further isolation at JSC. Additionally, 1 liter of water was sent back in to Earth for further isolation at JSC on R2A agar. All isolates were cataloged and then stored at -80C in 15% glycerol until regrown on R2A agar slants and sent to JCVI. No permits were required for this transport. JCVI conducted an internal review to ensure safe handling and containment. Upon arrival at JCVI all isolates were further plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and incubated overnight at 35°C, then inoculated into 4mls of tryptic soy broth (TSB). 2mls were stored with 15% glycerol as 1ml bacterial stocks and 2mls were centrifuged to form pellets with supernatant decanted then immediately frozen at -80C for future DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using a standard phenol/chloroform protocol. DNA was quantified using nanodrop and run on a gel to ensure high molecular weight samples were obtained.</p>

                <p>400ng of high molecular weight bacterial in 13ul of 1X TE (10mM Tris pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA) was processed using the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) protocol at half the standard reaction volumes. To the 13ul DNA, 3.5 ul of NEBNext Ultra II FS Reaction Buffer and 1ul of NEBNext Ultra II FS Enzyme was added in a PCR tube and then incubated in a thermocycler at 37°C for 10 minutes at 37°C for fragmentation to target size, the enzyme is then denatured by incubating the reaction at 65°C for 30 minutes with lid set to 75°C. Next, adapter ligation is carried out on the 17.5 ul mixture of fragmented DNA by adding 15 ul of NEBNext Ultra II Ligation Master Mix, 0.5 ul of NEBNext Ligation Enhancer, 1.25 ul of NEBNext Adapter for Illumina for a total volume of 34.25 ul. The 34.25 ul adapter mixture is incubated at 20°C for 15 minutes a thermocycler with the heated lid off. This is followed by the addition of 1.5ul of USER Enzyme to the mixture, then incubation in the thermocycler at 37C for 15 minutes with heated lit set to 47C. In order to obtain 700–900 bp inserts, we used SPRIselect beads for a rightside clean-up of 0.25X, where the supernatant is retained for a left side clean up using a 0.25X bead clean up then eluted in 7.5 ul of 0.1X TE buffer. The fragmented, adapter ligated and size selected libraries were then amplified using 12.5 ul of NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix with 2.5 ul i7 index primer and 2.5 ul i5 Universal PCR primer for a total volume of 25 ul. The amplification was carried out at the following temperatures and times: initial denaturation at 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 4 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 seconds and annealing/extension at 65°C for 75 seconds, and a final extension at 65°C for 5 minutes. A total of 58 libraries were generated, quality controlled to find library size using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and high sensitivity DNA chip and double stranded DNA concentration was quantified using Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation. Libraries were normalized to achieve a total of 700 pM of pooled library in 200 ul with an average library size of 750 bps. An average of 7 million, 150 bp reads were obtained for the combined read 1 and read 2 of each library using Illumina’s NextSeq 500 High Output Kit.</p>

                <title>Macrophage infection</title>
                <p>The infection assay aimed for a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 ISS <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> cells for every one macrophage cell. Biological replicates of the experiment were conducted on three separate days to ensure a robust reproducibility in results. At time zero CFU/mL count was conducted for inoculum of each ISS isolate and was averaged for each biological replicate experiment of the separate days. These counts showed that our experimental MOI was in the range of MOI 5–11 with an average of MOI of 7 over the three replicated experiments. The bacteria were allowed to infect the macrophage cells for two hours before being washed away and replaced with fresh media containing 15ug/mL ceftazidime and 1mg/ml amikacin to ensure clearance of extra cellular bacteria. At six, eight, twelve and 24 hours post-infection, the ISS treated sample supernatant and control supernatant from uninfected cells is collected and macrophage cells were removed by centrifugation at 300rpm for 2mins. The supernatant was then assessed for the presence of lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) using a Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche, Germany). The cell-free supernatant is incubated with the reaction mixture from the kit. LDH activity is determined using an enzymatic test. In the first step NAD+ is reduced to NADH/H+ by the LDH-catalyzed conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step the catalyst (diaphorase) transfers H/H+ from NADH/H+ to the tetrazolium salt INT which is reduced to formazan. The enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 l/ well 1N HCl (final concentration: 0.2 N HCl) after 10 minutes of incubation. The formazan dye absorbance was measured using the 490nm wavelength. We present the LDH data for all ISS strains and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>contaminans</italic> J2956 and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cepacia</italic> ATCC25416 reference strains (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227152.g005">5</xref>; n = 3). The no-infection control was no different than the wells with media alone where no LDH was released due to a lack of cells. The media and cells plus media alone were similar for all timepoints. The cells were growing well and not dying due to our selected seeding number at the start of the experiment. The cells plus media control or the “no-infection control” and media control absorbance values were averaged and subtracted from the treatments as background values.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the macrophages were washed after removal of the supernatants at six, eight, twelve- and 24-hours post-infection to remove any dead extracellular bacterial cells, then lysed in order enumerate the intracellular bacterial cells by plating and colony counting. For this and the following physiology reported, t-tests were performed followed by Bonferroni correction in comparing the ISS-derived isolates to the type-strain references, and ANOVA (followed by a post-hoc TukeyHSD test when appropriate) was performed to compare the isolates. Mantel tests were performed to check for correlations between physiology and date of isolation and distance based on the SNV trees. All R code linked below.</p>

Cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 1, then diluted 1:100, each culture was then plated into one column of three 96 well polystyrene plates at 150 μl per well. The cultures were covered with adhesive film, then incubated at 35°C for 24, 48, and 72 hours. At each timepoint an entire 96 well plate having 11 cultures and control culture were stained using crystal violet (3g/L solution). This process includes removing the cultured media from each well by inverting the plate and giving it 3–5 abrupt shakes into a waste container, then rinsing the wells lightly with water. This is followed by the addition of 150 μl of crystal violet into each well, the crystal violet is incubated in the well to adhere to any remaining biofilm for exactly 15 minutes, then the plate is carefully inverted and given 3–5 abrupt shakes into a crystal violet waste container. The plate is carefully rinsed with water and then laid upside down to dry. Once each of the 3 time points have been processed, the crystal violet is resolubilized for each timepoint plate using 100% EtOH by pipette mixing, then transferred to a new plate and covered to avoid evaporation. The resolubilized crystal violet strain is then placed in a plate reader to obtain an absorbance at 590 nm. N = 8.</p>
