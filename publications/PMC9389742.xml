                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Spaceflight is a novel and profoundly stressful environment for life. One aspect of spaceflight, microgravity, has been shown to perturb animal physiology thereby posing numerous health risks, including dysregulation of normal developmental pathways. Microgravity can also negatively impact the interactions between animals and their microbiomes. However, the effects of microgravity on developmental processes influenced by beneficial microbes, such as apoptosis, remains poorly understood. Here, the binary mutualism between the bobtail squid, <italic>Euprymna scolopes,</italic> and the gram-negative bacterium, <italic>Vibrio fischeri,</italic> was studied under modeled microgravity conditions to elucidate how this unique stressor alters apoptotic cell death induced by beneficial microbes.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Analysis of the host genome and transcriptome revealed a complex network of apoptosis genes affiliated with extrinsic/receptor-mediated and intrinsic/stress-induced apoptosis. Expression of apoptosis genes under modeled microgravity conditions occurred earlier and at high levels compared to gravity controls, in particular the expression of genes encoding initiator and executioner caspases. Functional assays of these apoptotic proteases revealed heightened activity under modeled microgravity; however, these increases could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The outcomes of this study indicated that modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression and that this process is mediated in part by caspases. Modeled microgravity-associated increases of caspase activity can be pharmacologically inhibited suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par4">Microgravity is a profound source of physiological stress in animals during spaceflight. A reduction in Earth’s gravity can significantly change the shear forces, buoyancy-driven convection, and hydrostatic pressures that organisms experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], thus altering critical biological pathways at the cellular, subcellular, and molecular level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par5">One such pathway that can be negatively impacted during spaceflight and microgravity analogs conditions is apoptosis or programmed cell death. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated process that eliminates damaged and unnecessary cells without inflammation and constitutes a critical lever of physiological homeostasis in multicellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Anomalies in programmed cell death have been attributed to some of the most debilitating health effects of spaceflight, including muscular atrophy, bone demineralization, immune system dysregulation, cardiovascular deconditioning, and visual impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, rodent studies conducted with the hindlimb unloading model, which mimics the reduced weight-bearing of spaceflight through a 30° head-down tilt, have reported higher rates of myonuclear and osteocytic apoptosis during muscular atrophy and bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other studies have shown that exposure to actual or simulated microgravity conditions can induce apoptosis in the leukocytes of humans and mice, with effects lingering for up to a week post-flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Endothelial cells (e.g., coronary arteries) also exhibit increased mortality under microgravity conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which may contribute to cardiovascular deterioration in flight. Collectively, these findings indicate a more intricate understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying microgravity-induced apoptosis in animals is needed to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of crew members during long-term space missions.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Indeed, dysbiosis is a well-known consequence of spaceflight and there is compelling evidence to suggest that disruptions in an animal’s normal, healthy, microbiome may be related to dysfunctional apoptotic cell death in microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Altered proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the gastrointestinal tract of mice have been associated with reduced apoptosis among colonic epithelial cells in modeled microgravity, thus hindering tissue turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Simulated weightlessness has also been shown to induce apoptotic damage in the intestinal mucosal barrier of rats, which is paralleled by compositional changes in the gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">To address these issues, the monospecific mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, <italic>Euprymna scolopes,</italic> and the gram-negative bacterium <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> has emerged as a tractable model system to study the impact of reduced gravity on bacteria-induced changes to host physiology, including apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. <italic>V. fischeri</italic> colonizes a specialized light organ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a-c) in the host squid and produces luminescence that the squid uses at night to conceal its shadow from predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Shortly after <italic>E. scolopes</italic> hatch, <italic>V. fischeri</italic> are entrained from the surrounding seawater via ciliated epithelial appendages (CEA) that border each lobe of the nascent light organ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), and in so doing, potentiate colonization. Shortly thereafter, microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) molecules, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tracheal cytotoxin, induce a post-embryonic remodeling event during which apoptosis is widely induced throughout the light organ’s ciliated fields (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), peaking at 16 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Subsequently, in the days following colonization, these structures completely regress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and the light organ undergoes further maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of the host <italic>Euprymna scolopes,</italic> experimental setup, and developmental timeline under different gravitational treatments. <bold>a</bold> Image of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> paralarvae at the time of hatching. The location of the light organ within the host mantle cavity is marked (black box). <bold>b</bold> Fluorescent micrograph showing the bilobed light organ (top) with pronounced fields of ciliated epithelial cells forming distinctive appendage-like structures (cea) extending from either side of the light organ. Light organs stained with acridine orange at the time of hatching (lower left) and during the peak of bacteria-induced apoptosis at 16 h (lower right) show punctate nuclei demarking apoptotic cell death only in those cells exposed to <italic>V. fischeri</italic>. <bold>c</bold> High aspect ratio vessels positioned in the modeled microgravity treatment (left) and gravity (right) control positions. <bold>d</bold> Comparative timeline demonstrating the shift in bacteria-induced apoptosis between gravity and modeled microgravity conditions.

              <p id="Par8">To simulate microgravity, high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) have been successfully used with the squid-vibrio symbiosis to generate a low sheared modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Briefly, rotation about a horizontal axis offsets gravitational settling such that the contents of each reactor are maintained in a state of constant suspension under low shear conditions that emulate the quiescent fluid dynamics of low Earth orbit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Rotation about a vertical axis, by contrast, allows for sedimentation to occur unperturbed and thus serves as the unit Earth gravity controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The LSMMG environment produced by this ground-based analog has been used for decades to model microgravity, and results obtained with the HARVs have been shown to parallel the findings of many spaceflight studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par9">Previously, studies using the squid-vibrio model in LSMMG revealed that the bacteria-induced development of the light organ is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], however, the mechanisms by which these changes occur are unknown. In this study, we characterize several aspects of the apoptosis genetic machinery in the host squid, examine the differential expression of several of these apoptosis-related genes, and assess the activity and mitigation potential of several initiator and executioner caspases associated with apoptosis under modeled microgravity conditions. The outcomes provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying apoptotic dysregulation in response to microgravity-like stress and its potential impact on the physiology of animals and beneficial microbes during spaceflight.</p>

This search identified 293 transcripts, representing 137 unique genes, involved in the regulation of apoptosis in the host squid (Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The resultant network revealed an elaborate web of parallel and hierarchical interactions and pro-and anti-apoptotic effectors that appear to govern extrinsic, receptor-mediated, and intrinsic, stress-induced cell death via transcriptional, translational, and post-translational means (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Putative pathways for apoptosis in <italic>Euprymna scolopes.</italic> The candidates identified from the genome and reference transcriptome included effectors of both extrinsic/receptor-mediated, and intrinsic/stress-associated, apoptosis. Representative interactions were mapped by cross referencing the multi-species KEGG pathway for apoptosis (ko04215) with peer-reviewed literature</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12866_2022_2614_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par11">For the extrinsic apoptosis network, two tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily members (Tnfrsf11, Tnfrsf21) and five Tnf-associated factors (Traf 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7) were discovered in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The closely related initiator caspases-8 and -10 were also identified, as well as death domain-associated adaptors Fadd, Daxx, and the stress-associated kinase Ripk1. Interestingly, neither Fas ligand nor its corresponding receptor was found in the reference transcriptome despite the presence of components known to operate downstream (e.g., Fadd). Nevertheless, <italic>E. scolopes</italic> was determined to harbor all the effectors required to assemble a complete death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) for extrinsic, receptor-mediated apoptosis, which serves as the activation assembly for extrinsic initiator caspases-10 and -8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, transcripts associated with three LPS-binding proteins (Lbps) and the LPS-induced transcription factor, Litaf, which have been previously described in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] were also observed in the putative extrinsic, receptor-mediated network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par12">With regards to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, transcripts encoding both pro-apoptotic (Bnip3, Bcl10, Bcl2L13, Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl2L1, Mcl1, Ar1) members of the Bcl2 protein family were found in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>). A variety of mitochondrial proteins (i.e., Aifm1, Aifm3, Diablo, Cytc, Htra2) were identified as well as Apaf1 and the intrinsic initiator caspase-9. Thus, all the requisite parts of the apoptosome, which is the activation complex of the stress-induced pathway for cell death were found in the bobtail squid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, the Bh3-only protein Bid, which typically represents a critical junction for crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways for apoptosis in animals, was conspicuously absent. Likewise, the presence of atypical initiator caspase-2 was confirmed along with Pidd1, both of which are constituents of the pro-death, p53-inducible, PIDDosome complex that forms in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; however, no evidence of the third member of this assembly, Raidd/Cradd, was found in the bobtail squid reference transcriptome or genome.</p>
                <p id="Par13">In addition to Bcl2-type repressors, transcripts encoding numerous inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (Iaps) were discovered in the host squid. Included among these were Xiap, Diap2, three Baculoviral Iap-repeat containing proteins (Birc7b, Birc3, and Birc6), three Bcl2-associated athanogene regulators (Bag 1, 4, and 6), cell death regulator Aven, the peptidyl isomerase Pin1, as well as heat shock proteins Hsp90 and Hsp7c (Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Further examination revealed the presence of numerous cathepsin (B, K, L, L1, L2, Z) and calpain (1–3, 5, 7–9, 11, B, D) proteases, several of which have been previously reported in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The cathepsins recovered from the reference transcriptome were primarily cysteine-dependent, except for cathepsin B, which is a serine protease. Intriguingly, neither aspartic acid-type cathepsins (D and E) were found in the host squid.</p>
                <p id="Par14">Analysis of the <italic>E. scolopes</italic> reference transcriptome revealed a variety of nucleus-localizing proteins affiliated with apoptosis (Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Broadly, this included transcription factors (i.e., Aatf, Atf4, Jun, E2f, Hox, Irf, Litaf, NF-κB, p73), p53-type transactivators (i.e., Aspp1, Ccar1), and apoptotic mediators of chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation (i.e., Acin1, Dffb/Cad, EndoG) (Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Transcripts encoding numerous regulators of apoptotic translation were likewise present in the squid, most notably the eukaryotic initiation factors Eif2, Eif3f, Eif3j, Eif4b, and Eif4e (Table S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Interestingly, however, no transactivating factors of internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation were present in the transcriptome of <italic>E. scolopes</italic>, and the nuclear lamin protease and executioner caspase, caspase-6, was not observed.</p>

                <p id="Par16">With regards to effectors of extrinsic, receptor-mediated, apoptosis, the LPS binding proteins 1 and 3, along with the endotoxin-induced transcription factor Litaf were significantly up-expressed in modeled microgravity between 6 and 10 h post-hatching (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

                <p id="Par21">Several EsCasps exhibited key structural elements characteristic of caspases in other animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For example, the extrinsic initiator caspase-8 of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> (EsCasp8) exhibited dual twin death effector domains (DED) at the N-terminus, which is characteristic of both vertebrates and invertebrate caspase-8 proteins; however, this dual DED domain was missing in the initiator EsCasp10 isoforms when compared to vertebrates <italic>H. sapiens, D. rerio,</italic> and <italic>X. laevis</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). EsCasp10 did harbor a singular caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), suggesting a potential misannotation.</p>
                <p id="Par22">The CARD domain was also observed in EsCasp2 and -9 initiator caspases, which is typical of most vertebrates and invertebrates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

                <p id="Par25">Unexpectedly, EsCasp9 clustered with the two sequences that were likely misannotated as isoforms of caspase-10. Although the monophyly of the group is indeterminate due to the low outer branch support value (42%), these sequences share several distinguishing features that suggest they may represent a group of caspase-9-like initiators that is specific to <italic>Euprymna</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a)<italic>.</italic> First, the domain organization of EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X emulates that of canonical caspases -2 and -9, with an N-terminal CARD domain and a C-terminal CASc region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Second, although the sequences of this group exhibit 94 to 95% identity with one another, their percent identity scores with the other initiator caspases are very low, between 15 and 29%, which indicates they may have distinct structural features (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Third, EsCasp9, EsCasp10_1X, and EsCasp10_2X all exhibit a conserved “QACQP” catalytic pentapeptide (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Caspases, uniformly, possess a QACXG motif in the active site, with the middle position specifying the catalytic cysteine residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Given its crucial importance to the protease activity of caspases, variations within this pentapeptide are limited and may denote similar functions.</p>
                <p id="Par26">The maximum likelihood estimation of executioner caspases formed two several distinctive groups primarily separated into vertebrate and invertebrate clusters (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). For example, the vertebrate caspases-7 and -3 from <italic>H. sapiens, R. norvegicus, D. rerio</italic>, and <italic>X. laevis</italic> formed distinctive groupings, that excluded most of the molluscan isoforms. Interestingly, two caspase-7 isoforms from <italic>E. scolopes</italic> (EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X) had a higher association with the vertebrate executioner caspases than the other molluscan orthologs for caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). This phylogeny may allude to a greater degree of differentiation, or perhaps expansion, among the executioner caspases of the squid, which has previously been documented in bivalves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the percent identity among the executioners was 47% which makes it difficult to discern whether these sequences represent isoforms of the same gene(s) or an expansion of caspases-3 and -7 in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par27">Overall, there appeared to be a relatively high degree of similarity among the executioner caspases of <italic>E. scolopes</italic>. However, the close affiliation of EsCasp7_2X and EsCasp7_4X with vertebral orthologs suggests the presence of at least two distinct executioner-type caspases in the squid. Unsurprisingly, both the initiator and executioner caspases of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> were most closely related to <italic>O. sinensis,</italic> and to a lesser extent, <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic>, which is consistent with their categorization as both soft-bodied cephalopods and, more broadly, mollusks.</p>

                <p id="Par29">To test whether the caspases could be inhibited in the host animals, pre-treatment with inhibitors targeting different caspases was used. Treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, and the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc for two hours prior to the start of the symbiosis significantly reduced apoptotic cell levels at 16 h in symbiotic hatchlings compared to untreated symbiotic controls but did not completely inhibit apoptosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). Interestingly, although the Caspase-Glo assays indicated caspase-9 was active during the apex of cell death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c), treatment with the caspase-9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK did not reduce the level of pycnotic nuclei observed at 16 h relative to the untreated or DMSO-treated controls (Fig. d). Additionally, the coupling of different inhibitors showed no additive effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). The colonization of the host squid did not appear to be affected as symbiotic animals exhibited normal luminescence levels throughout the experimental treatments.</p>
                <p id="Par30">To elucidate the effects of LSMMG stress on caspase activity, 10 h symbiotic animals were examined with Caspase Glo activity kits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This time point was chosen as it coincided with the higher expression of caspase transcripts in LSMMG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Results indicated that LSMMG-treated animals exhibited higher levels of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 activity compared to gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, b). Interestingly, no differences were observed in caspase-9 activity in symbiotic animals incubated under LSMMG or gravity conditions, (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c).

              <p id="Par31">As humans prepare for space exploration beyond low Earth orbit, it will be critical to fully understand the impact that spaceflight has on mutualistic animal-microbe interactions. Maintaining a healthy microbiome during long-duration spaceflights will require a comprehensive assessment of the effects that environmental stresses, such as microgravity, have on the bacteria-induced development of host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To address this key issue in space biology, we examined the effects of simulated microgravity on the beneficial association between <italic>Euprymna scolopes</italic> and <italic>Vibrio fischeri,</italic> specifically focusing on the phenomenon of bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of the squid host. The outcomes of this study indicated that (i) <italic>E. scolopes</italic> harbors a rich network of genes involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic regulation; (ii) the presence of symbiotic bacteria and LSMMG-stress altered the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression; (iii) the normal, bacteria-induced apoptosis in the squid light organ is mediated in part by caspases that exhibit increased activity under LSMMG; and (iv) the LSMMG-associated increase of caspase activity can be pharmacologically mitigated with inhibitors.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Apoptosis is a critical pathway for animal development playing key roles in tissue homeostasis, antimicrobial defense as well as innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to discern the effects of the microbiome on apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and how this vital form of physiological cell death is altered by microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Although <italic>E. scolopes</italic> has served as a model organism for decades, the pathways by which the symbiont <italic>V. fischeri</italic> induces apoptotic cell death have not been fully delineated with only a few effectors identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The recent sequencing of the <italic>E. scolopes</italic> genome and reference transcriptome has enabled critical animal pathways, including apoptosis, to be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par33">Analyses revealed that <italic>E. scolopes</italic> harbors genes associated with both primary pathways for cell death that are typically seen in animals, including death-receptor mediated extrinsic pathways as well as intracellular stress-induced intrinsic pathways (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Results also suggest that <italic>E. scolopes</italic> may form distinct caspase activation platforms, particularly regarding the extrinsic, receptor-mediated, pathway. For example, the absence of Cradd in <italic>E. scolopes</italic>, as well as in the octopus genome, suggests that cephalopod caspase-2 exerts its pro-apoptotic effects outside the PIDDosome complex, likely in association with Tnf receptor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Intriguingly, for 15 apoptosis candidates in the reference transcriptome of <italic>E. scolopes</italic>, no proteins of significant similarity were found in the SwissProt database via BLASTx or BLASTp (Additional File <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)<italic>.</italic> These queries were initially identified based on possessing a CARD- or DED-domain and preliminary BLASTp analysis using non-redundant NCBI database returned mostly uncharacterized and predicted caspase-interacting protein in other cephalopods. Accordingly, these unknown candidates may represent novel apoptotic effectors within the Mollusca phylum.</p>
              <p id="Par34">In general, cephalopods appear to possess a more expansive vertebrate-like repertoire of intrinsic apoptosis genes than other mollusks, including Bnip3, Bax, Apaf1, Htra2, and Pidd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These results suggest that apoptosis has undergone substantial lineage-specific modifications within the Mollusca phylum, which may have resulted in distinct mechanisms of induction. For example, caspase-9 proteins have been described in the mussel <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic> despite the lack of Apaf1, which is a critical component of the apoptosome complex in other animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35">Under the stress of LSMMG conditions, however, there was an acceleration and increased expression of the transcripts associated with bacteria-induced apoptosis genes in symbiotic animals, specifically related to extrinsic, receptor-mediated cell death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The increased transcriptional response in symbiotic animals was primarily observed among PRR elements for LPS, including LPS-binding proteins Lbp1 and Lbp3, as well as the LPS-induced transcription factor Litaf (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Elevated concentrations of Lbps have been observed in blood plasma of astronauts returning from shuttle missions, as well as the sera of mice following two days of hindlimb suspension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">In <italic>E. scolopes</italic>, however, previous work has demonstrated that Lbps1 exhibits a symbiosis-specific function and contributes to bacteria-induced apoptosis in the light organ of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Little is known about the functions of Lbp2 and Lbp3 in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> and the precise mechanisms by which symbiotic paralarvae identify LPS remain unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, mammalian Lbps facilitate the receptor-based recognition of gram-negative endotoxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which raises the possibility that the Lbps of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> may be responsible for the delivery of symbiont LPS to death receptors on target host cells, thereby promoting extrinsic apoptosis throughout the ciliated epithelium of the light organ. Additionally, previous studies have shown that LSMMG can increase the shedding of reactogenic LPS by <italic>V. fischeri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], thus the combined increase in available MAMP shedding coupled with the increased expression of Lbp1 and Lbp3 receptors in LSMMG may facilitate the accelerated extrinsic apoptosis response in the symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In symbiotic hatchlings, the expression of genes associated with intrinsic, stress-induced, cell death was also increased under LSMMG conditions, specifically within the window of 10 to 12 h post-bacterial colonization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This increase included the Bh3-only protein Bnip3, the membrane permeabilizer Bak, as well as the mitochondrial proteins Diablo and Aifm3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Previous studies with space shuttle-flown murine embryonic stem cells have also shown a similar up-regulation of intrinsic apoptosis-associated genes, including Bnip3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">Bh3-only proteins are the sentinels of stress-induced apoptosis and form the molecular basis of crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Bnip3 expression is known to be induced by hypoxia-dependent signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS), both of which are elements of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Although no evidence of hypoxia was observed in the HARVs during the experimental conditions (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>), reactive oxygen and nitric oxide stress are critical components during the onset of the squid-vibrio symbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Indeed, the phenomenon of spaceflight and microgravity-induced oxidative stress has been extensively documented in astronauts and many other model organisms and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Consequently, the up expression of Bnip3, Bak, Diablo, and Aifm3 implies that modeled microgravity-derived oxidative stress may compound the normal, bacteria-induced, development of the light organ in <italic>E. scolopes</italic> via atypical stimulation of the intrinsic pathway.</p>
              <p id="Par39">The results also indicated that the expression of pro-death caspases was increased in symbiotic animals under modeled microgravity. Caspases are cysteine-dependent proteases that are widely regarded as the “core machinery” of apoptosis and are responsible for mediating the initiation and fallout associated with most known pathways for cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This study found that both initiator and executioner-type caspases were up-expressed during accelerated light organ apoptosis in modeled microgravity-treated symbiotic hatchlings compared to gravity controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The detection of functional caspase enzymes in aposymbiotic controls in the absence of apoptotic cells in the light organ suggests that there is a critical execution threshold for cascade activation. Thus, it appears that the superficial ciliated epithelial cells of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> light organ are “primed” for morphogenesis via baseline levels of initiator and executioner caspase activity that are maintained below the activation threshold for apoptosis until the symbiotic cues for development, such as LPS, are received.</p>
              <p id="Par40">In symbiotic hatchlings, the increase of transcripts encoding pro-death caspases under LSMMG conditions coincided with the early onset and premature peak of developmental cell death (i.e., 6 – 10 h post inoculation) previously observed in the squid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Notably, the amount of initiator caspase has been shown to positively correlate with the extent of downstream executioner activation, and to irreversibly induce apoptosis a certain threshold of activity must be surpassed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. These results suggest that the increased caspase expression in LSMMG may lower the activation threshold of light organ apoptosis due to the increased availability of proenzymes, which closely parallels previous reports that the concentrations of pro-caspases-9 and -3 are key predictors of apoptotic susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par41">The initiators and executioners of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> exhibited a high degree of structural similarity to the orthologs of other animals in particular initiators EsCasp2 and EsCasp8 as well as executioners EsCasp3 and EsCasp7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. However, anomalies were observed in both isoforms of squid caspase-10<italic>,</italic> which contained a single CARD at the N-terminus rather than a dual DED (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This significant deviation from the structural norm indicates that the EsCasp10 sequences were likely misannotated, given that their structure more closely resembles that of initiator caspases-2 and -9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par42">Additionally, there were deviations in the CASc precursor domain of several caspase isoforms in the host squid, such as EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9, where the smaller p10 subunit was not observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In animals, the primary sequence of the p10 subunit is subject to greater variation than the larger p20 due to the absence of catalytic cysteine and histidine residues, which may have precluded its detection in EsCasp2_2X and EsCasp9. Given that an intact CASc region was identified within these isoforms it is like these two isoforms are functional despite the inability to identify the p10 subunits within the CASC precursor domain.</p>
              <p id="Par43">Maximum likelihood analysis demonstrated that the initiator caspases of <italic>E. scolopes, H. sapiens, R. norvegicus</italic>, <italic>D. rerio</italic>, <italic>X. laevis</italic>, <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic>, and <italic>O. sinensis</italic> clustered primarily based on like orthologs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The segregation of initiators into three groups bearing high identity to caspases-8 and -10, -9, and -2 is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses that illustrated further subdivisions between the vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The exclusion of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> and <italic>M. galloprovincialis</italic> from the subclade of vertebral caspase-9 orthologs, along with their placement on opposing branches of the unrooted phylogenetic tree next to same-species sequences, implies that lineage-specific variations have occurred in the intrinsic initiator caspases of mollusks (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).</p>
              <p id="Par44">The increased activity of all tested caspases in symbiotic animals relative to aposymbiotic controls suggests both receptor-mediated and stress-induced apoptosis pathways occurring in the bacteria-induced development of the host light organ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However, inhibition of caspases under unit gravity resulted in a decrease of only 50% of apoptotic pycnotic nuclei, suggesting that the normal <italic>V. fischeri</italic>-induced apoptosis pathways in the light organ of <italic>E. scolopes</italic> are partially, but not entirely, caspase-dependent. These results align with the previous finding that cathepsin L – a lysosomal, cysteine-dependent protease – also contributes to developmental cell death in symbiotic paralarvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], suggesting apoptosis in the host animals is mediated by a multi-faceted array of apoptosis-associated proteases that are triggered by both external and intrinsic signals.</p>
              <p id="Par45">Under the stress of LSMMG, however, our findings suggest that the increase in apoptotic cell death levels in symbiotic light organs is mediated primarily through caspase activation via the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The phenotype of increased apoptotic nuclei in the light organ under LSMMG was mitigated using caspase inhibitors, producing statistically equivalent numbers of pycnotic nuclei compared to unit gravity controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>d). These increases in caspase activity complement our previous findings that GO terms related to enzymatic activity and catalysis were disproportionately enriched in LSMMG-treated paralarvae at 12 and 24 h compared to gravity controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These data also parallel previous studies that showed spaceflight and modeled microgravity-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes and erythrocytes was significantly reduced by caspase inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">Although most initiator and executioner caspases were up expressed in LSMMG conditions, not all were pharmacologically inhibited. Interestingly, treatment with the Ac-LEHD-CMK caspase-9 inhibitor did not produce a significant reduction in the amount of apoptosis observed under gravity conditions in symbiotic animals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). Additionally, no LSMMG-induced increase was observed in the caspase-9 activity, despite the increase in transcript levels at 10 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Given that the recognition peptide of the caspase-9 inhibitor is identical to that of the Caspase-Glo substrate (LEHD-CMK), it is unlikely that this phenomenon derives from differences in binding affinity or substrate specificity with the caspase-9 of <italic>E. scolopes</italic>. Caspase-9 has traditionally been considered an upstream caspase that depends on the binding to the CARD motif Apaf-1 apoptosome for activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and is the first caspase of the ROS-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Thus, these results suggest there could be alternative pathways for the onset of executioner caspases in the host squid other than caspase-9-dependent pathways. For example, apoptosis can be activated through apoptosome-independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], thus more research is needed to understand the role of caspase-9 under both gravity and LSMMG conditions.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par47">Taken together, these results suggest that external stresses, such as modeled microgravity, can cause perturbations to the normal apoptotic pathways in animals. As many of the mechanisms that <italic>E. scolopes</italic> use to communicate with <italic>V. fischeri</italic> are present in other animals (e.g., Lbps) this research provides a framework for understanding how animals respond differentially to the stresses of spaceflight in the presence and absence of their symbionts. For spaceflight, understanding how disruptions in host-microbe homeostasis and animal physiology alter normal physiological responses, such as apoptosis, is critical. Furthermore, the ability to modulate the life or death of a cell as well as identify mitigation targets or strategies to prevent perturbations of animal-microbe homeostasis has immense therapeutic potential for maintaining crew health for long-duration spaceflight.</p>

Egg clutches laid by the female squid were incubated in separate aquaria from the adults for the entirety of paralarvae development (~ 21 days). Newly hatched paralarvae were rinsed twice in 0.22 μm filtered seawater (FSW), then either preserved in an aposymbiotic state (i.e., without <italic>V. fischeri</italic>) or rendered symbiotic by inoculation with the wild-type, strain ES114, to a final concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> cells per mL of FSW. For all experiments, colonization was confirmed by measuring luminescence with an ATP photometer (GloMax 20/20, Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For symbiotic experiments, log cultures of <italic>V. fischeri</italic> were prepared in seawater tryptone broth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] and incubated at 28˚C with 225 rpm shaking.

Briefly, for aposymbiotic conditions, the HARVs were filled with FSW, whereas for symbiotic conditions HARVs contained 105 cells of V. fischeri ES114 per mL of FSW. After animals were added to the HARVs, the reactors were then sealed to prevent the formation of bubbles and incubated at 23 °C in a synchronized LED-illuminated Percival incubator (Percival Scientific Inc., Perry, IA) with rotation at 13 rpm. The HARVs were either rotated around a vertical axis to control for unit gravity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c left) or were rotated around a horizontal axis to mimic microgravity conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c right). The dissolved oxygen content (DO2) of the FSW collected from the HARVs was also measured at 24 h with a hand-held probe (Sper Scientific, Scottsdale, AZ) in a minimum of three replicates.</p>
                <p id="Par51">For control purposes, and to establish a baseline for enzyme assays and inhibitor treatments, a cohort of hatchling animals were incubated in borosilicate scintillation vials alongside the HARV reactors until 16 h post-hatching, which marks the peak of developmental cell death in normal gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For all treatments, at least one animal from each treatment was put aside to confirm colonization and/or quantify light organ apoptosis. The remaining squid were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen or dry ice and stored at – 80 °C until downstream analysis.</p>

Afterwards, a LIMMA-voom transformation was applied and the output – expressed as log<sub>2</sub> counts-per-million (log<sub>2</sub>CPM) – was used to fit a linear regression model.

                <p id="Par58">To determine the contributions of different caspases to bacteria-induced apoptosis, hatchling animals were exposed to a series of targeted protease inhibitors. The inhibitors used in this study include the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, the caspase 8 inhibitor Ac-IETD-CHO, and the caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CMK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) as well as the irreversible serine protease inhibitor, Pefabloc (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). All inhibitor solutions were 0.22 µm-filter sterilized and stored at – 80 °C until use. Caspase inhibitors were used at final concentrations of 60 and 100 μM for vial and HARV experiments, respectively. For all experiments, the final concentration of the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc was 25 μM. These concentrations were chosen in part as they did not cause apparent toxicity to the animal and did not impede colonization. Inhibitor treatment occurred for 2 h before the start of the experiment. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) controls were run in parallel where appropriate.</p>
