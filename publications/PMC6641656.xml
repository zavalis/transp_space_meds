              <abstract>
                <p>Although the biological systems in the human body are affected by the earth’s gravity, information about the underlying molecular mechanisms is limited. For example, apoptotic signaling is enhanced in cancer cells subjected to microgravity. We reasoned that signaling regulated by p53 may be involved because of its role in apoptosis. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the molecular mechanisms of modified cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP)-sensitivity under simulated microgravity by focusing on p53-related cell death mechanisms. Immunoblotting analyses indicated that, under microgravity, CDDP-induced ATM/p53 signaling increased and caspase-3 was cleaved earlier. However, microgravity decreased the levels of expression of p53 targets <italic>BAX</italic> and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. Interestingly, microgravity increased the <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>DRAM1</italic>, and <italic>PRKAA1</italic> mRNA levels. However, microgravity decreased the levels of mTOR and increased the LC3-II/I ratio, suggesting the activation of autophagy. The CDDP-induced cleavage of caspase-3 was increased during the early phase in Group MG (+), and cleaved caspase-3 was detected even in Group MG (+) with constitutive expression of a mutant type of p53 (hereafter, “+” indicates CDDP treatment). These results interestingly indicate that microgravity altered CDDP sensitivity through activation of caspase-3 by p53-independent mechanism.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Our biological systems work properly in 1G gravity, indicating that those are governed by gravitational force on the earth [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The microgravity environment of space flight causes muscle atrophy, decreases bone density, and alters the immune response, as well as other physiological processes [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may contribute to the discovery of therapeutic strategies for preventing and treating muscle atrophy and osteoporosis [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite the potential importance of research in this area, research in space is so costly that few researchers are able to conduct the experiments [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, effects of microgravity in space are difficult to distinguish from those of cosmic radiation [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>For these reasons, our group developed the 3D-clinostat to conduct cell culture under simulated microgravity (10<sup>−3</sup> G). Using the 3D-clinostat, we demonstrated that simulated microgravity affects biological processes such as embryogenesis, stemness of embryonic stem cells, and the differentiation of skeletal muscle [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, we found that cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP) promotes the death of glioma cells cultured under simulated microgravity, and others have found that simulated microgravity promotes the apoptosis of cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>
              <p>The cell death-related mechanisms of apoptosis and autophagy are regulated by p53 signal, at least in part [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, little is known about the effects of simulated microgravity on p53-mediated signal transduction. Therefore, here we focused on the importance of simulated microgravity in the regulation of apoptosis signals by p53.</p>

Then, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in CanGet Signal primary buffer (TOYOBO) overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies and their dilutions were as follows: anti-p53 (OP43, ONCOGENE), 1:1000; anti-phospho-p53 (#9284, Cell Signaling Technology: CST), 1:500; anti-β-actin (A5316, Sigma-Aldrich), 1:5000; anti-ATM (#2873, CST), 1:1000; anti-phospho-ATM (#5883, CST), 1:1000; anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (#9661, CST), 1:500; anti-mTOR (#2983, CST), 1:1000; and anti-LC3A/B (#12741, CST), 1:1000. After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-rabbit IgG (NA934U, GE Healthcare) or anti-mouse IgG (NA931V; GE Healthcare) diluted in CanGet Signal second antibody buffer. After washing, membranes were incubated with the Pierce Femto Western Blotting Substrate, and the immune complexes were detected using X-ray film (GE Healthcare). Experiments were independently performed at least three times. Immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH). The expression level of each protein was normalized relative to that of β-actin. To show the autophagy status, the ratio of LC3A/B-II to LC3A/B-I was calculated.</p>

                <title>Effects of simulated microgravity on CDDP-induced cell growth inhibition</title>
                <p>First, we optimized the conditions for CDDP treatment to analyze its effect on the proliferation or apoptosis signals of HepG2 cells cultured under conditions of normal or simulated microgravity. HepG2 cells were employed because cell death is mediated by wild-type p53. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of CDDP for HepG2 was determined to be 419.6 ng/mL (Part A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). And immunoblotting demonstrated that 500 ng/mL CDDP was sufficient to activate ATM, p53, and caspase-3 at 48 h (Part B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Cells were divided into the four groups defined in the Materials and methods section and placed in the 3D-clinostat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Cells were treated with CDDP and harvested at the indicated times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). CDDP inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The numbers of Group MG (−) were higher compared with those of the Group 1G (−) after 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). When cells were treated with CDDP, the number of Group 1G (+) cells increased for 24 h and then started to decline until 72 h.

                <p>To clarify the effects of simulated microgravity on apoptosis and autophagy, we used immunoblotting to determine the levels of proteins involved in apoptosis or autophagy.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Although simulated microgravity induces apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the detailed mechanism is unknown. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic cell death under simulated microgravity, focusing on p53-mediated signaling. We found that HepG2 cells grew better under simulated microgravity. Furthermore, compared with normal gravity, the proliferation of HepG2 cells under simulated microgravity was effectively inhibited after treatment with CDDP. Although the proliferation of native HepG2 cells without or with CDDP treatment differed significantly between normal gravity and simulated microgravity, there was no significant difference when we tested HepG2 mock cells. We speculate that the transfection or G418-selection protocols may have influenced the cell cycle of HepG2 cells. This finding requires further research. HepG2 mt cells grew more than HepG2 mock cells under normal gravity (Parts C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the proliferation of HepG2 mt cells was significantly inhibited under simulated microgravity without or with CDDP treatment. These results suggest that artificial control over gravity or gravity-influenced signal transduction may serve as an anticancer strategy to treat cancer cells that express a mutant p53.</p>
              <p>We investigated ATM/p53-mediated apoptotic signaling, since ATM, an upstream regulator of p53, responds to DNA damage caused by CDDP treatment [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Specifically, we found that CDDP induced the synthesis of total and phosphorylated forms of ATM and p53 in native HepG2 cells under normal gravity. These surrogates of signaling in HepG2 mock cells and HepG2 mt cells were similarly induced under normal gravity. Under simulated microgravity, the induction of total and phosphorylated forms of ATM and p53 in native HepG2 cells and HepG2 mock cells was enhanced early. In HepG2 mt cells under simulated microgravity, ATM was regulated similarly to native HepG2 cells and HepG2 mock cells. In contrast, differences in gravity did not significantly influence the levels of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated p53.</p>
              <p>Cleaved caspase-3 in native HepG2 cells and HepG2 mock cells was induced with CDDP under normal gravity, but cleavage occurred earlier under simulated microgravity, suggesting the acceleration of apoptosis. The levels of cleaved caspase-3 in HepG2 mt cells were lower under normal gravity, although they were increased under simulated microgravity, suggesting the induction of apoptosis. The levels of <italic>BAX</italic> mRNA were significantly higher in HepG2 mt cells under simulated microgravity, although the levels were much lower compared with those of native HepG2 cells or HepG2 mock cells. These results suggest that the effects of CDDP treatment on ATM/p53 signaling may be altered by gravitational changes but we cannot completely explain the inhibition of growth of HepG2 mt cells under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>p53 signaling plays a key role in apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the expression of p53 and its upstream and downstream targets. Our results suggest that simulated microgravity enhanced the activity of the ATM/p53 signal transduction pathway early (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and Part A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the expression of DNA repair-related genes is down-regulated under simulated microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting that the increased activity of ATM at an early phase following drug treatment might be related to the down-regulation of the components of the DNA repair system. Despite the activation of p53 after 24–48 h under simulated microgravity, the levels of the mRNA encoding the p53 target <italic>BAX</italic>, which initiates apoptosis, were not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), suggesting that downstream signaling of p53 was inhibited under simulated microgravity. Further investigations will include promoter and ChIP assay, because epigenetic regulation is modulated during space flight [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our results using native HepG2 cells or HepG2 mock cells under simulated microgravity show that caspase-3 activity was increased, although p53/BAX signaling was attenuated, suggesting a possible mechanism of activation of caspase-3 induced by a pathway or pathways other than p53/BAX. Moreover, this hypothesis is supported by our observation that caspase-3 was activated in HepG2 mt cells under simulated microgravity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, and Parts B and C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Together, our results suggest that ATM/p53/BAX signaling induced by CDDP may be altered by gravitational changes but does not play a crucial role in the activation of caspase-3 under simulated microgravity. Furthermore, caspase-3 is regulated by other signaling pathways, such as FASL/FAS/Caspase-8 pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death pathway [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further experiments are required to clarify the mechanisms of activation of caspase-3 under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>We further analyzed intracellular signals relating to autophagy, because autophagy is increased under simulated microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Autophagy is regulated by numerous membrane molecules, which form the autophagosome [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Among them, LC3-II is generally used as a marker of autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In agreement with previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we found here that the ratios of LC3-II/I in native HepG2 cells under simulated microgravity, but not under normal gravity, were increased after CDDP treatment. Interestingly, the expression of mTOR whose activation suppresses autophagy, decreased in native HepG2 cells and HepG2 mock cells under simulated microgravity. In contrast, the ratios of LC3-II/I in HepG2 mt cells increased with CDDP treatment under both gravitational conditions, and the levels of mTOR were not significantly different. However, the levels and kinetics of autophagy-related gene products differed between gravitational conditions. These results suggest that CDDP-induced autophagy was activated under simulated microgravity and was enhanced in cells expressing a mutant p53, independent of the strength of the gravitational field.</p>
              <p>Autophagy plays a key role in influencing apoptosis and is regulated by the products of the p53-targets <italic>SESTRIN2</italic>, <italic>DRAM1</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, and <italic>PRKAA1</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Although the levels of <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>PRKAA1</italic> mRNAs, whose products are upstream regulators of mTOR, were specifically increased 72 h after CDDP treatment, while the levels of mTOR started to decrease 24 h after CDDP treatment, suggesting the regulation of mTOR activity by p53-independent signaling events. Furthermore, CDDP treatment increased the ratios of LC3-II/I in HepG2 mt cells under both normal and simulated microgravity conditions, independent of the levels of expression of genes that encode upstream components of the autophagy pathway (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g005">5B</xref>, and Part C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the levels of <italic>MTOR</italic> mRNA were unchanged under simulated microgravity, although protein levels were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219363.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>, and Part A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219363.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that microgravity affects the posttranslational regulation of the expression of mTOR, including translation, protein stability, or degradation [<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219363.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
              <p>In summary, here we used a 3D-clinostat to detect death-related signals in cells cultured under simulated microgravity. We found that simulated microgravity affected diverse cell deaths-related signals, which were maintained or inhibited, suggesting that normal gravity was important for the transduction, at least in part, of cell death-related signals. Moreover, we show that the proliferation of HepG2 cells expressing a mutant type p53 was inhibited under simulated microgravity without or with CDDP treatment. Further analysis of the pathway may contribute to developing anticancer strategies for cancer cells that express a mutant p53. To our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time that the activation of caspase-3 induced by CDDP treatment under simulated microgravity was independent of p53 status, suggesting that enhanced apoptosis signal under simulated microgravity is regulated through signals other than those transmitted by p53. Therefore, understanding of the cell death mechanisms that operate under simulated microgravity may contribute to identifying a novel factor that regulates cell death or proliferation. Such a discovery may facilitate the development of a new therapeutic approach for regenerative medicine or cancer therapy.</p>
