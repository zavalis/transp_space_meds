                <p>Alterations of the gravitational environment are likely to modify cell behavior. Several studies have proven that T cells are sensitive to gravity alterations and that microgravity conditions may induce immunosuppression and weakened T cell immune response in humans during spaceflights. The aim of this work was to elucidate if a specific treatment of Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer (REAC) technology could restore, after mitogenic activation (Con A), a correct expression of cytokine IL2 gene and its receptor IL2R alpha, which are inhibited in T cells under microgravity conditions, as demonstrated in several studies. The results of this study, conducted in microgravity simulated with Random Positioning Machine (RPM), confirm the T cell activation recovery and offer the evidence that REAC technology could contribute to the understanding of T cell growth responsiveness in space, reducing the impact of weightlessness on the immune system experienced by humans in long duration space missions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The REAC technology (acronym for Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyor) is a technology platform for neuro- and bio-modulation. Previous studies have proven that REAC technology is able to induce direct cell reprogramming of murine embryonal[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and human differentiated adult cells toward cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal muscle-like lineages[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, REAC technology has shown to be able to counteract aging processes [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], acting also on telomerase-independent and telomerase-dependent pathways [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and on endogenous Hyaluronic Acid (HA) and HA-binding proteins. Through its mechanism of action, REAC technology creates an interesting network that acts on the modulation of cell polarity and intracellular environment [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the basis of REAC efficacy as cell polarity optimizer[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the purpose of this study was the evaluation of REAC technology and in particular of its RGN-S treatment protocol[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as a potential countermeasure to win the impact of spaceflight stress on the alteration of the immune system experienced by humans in the space environment. In fact, one focus of today's research on cells in space is the signal transduction and the underlying mechanism of cell polarity modulation[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
              <p>In the last 30 years, more than 230 experiments conducted in space have shown that dramatic changes occur in several types of cells during their exposure to microgravity, and several studies evidenced microgravity effects onto Immune System and lymphocytes.</p>
              <p>T lymphocytes in microgravity were investigated in numerous experiments following Cogoli’s first observation that revealed that the failure of Concanavalin A in stimulating proliferation of lymphocytes was clearly due to the lack of gravity[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Concanavalin A activates T Lymphocytes by initiating a complex mechanism, which requires two further signals until the T cells start replicating their DNA. Crucial points of this process are the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2) by T cells and the autocrine interaction of IL-2 with the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL2Rα) expressed at the surface of activated T lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These experiments concluded that disturbed T cell function in weightlessness is the result of an altered architecture and function of the cytoskeleton, changing the secretion of cytokines and the expression of IL-1/IL-2 receptors[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This is why one focus of today's research on cells in space is the signal transduction.</p>
              <p>T cells are a good model to study signal transduction pathways, because three extracellular signals (mitogen, IL-1 and IL-2) are required for full activation, and two classical pathways (via proteins G and PKC, PKA) are activated within the cell[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (Ras and Rap) are interacting with the cytoskeleton[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The data at 0<italic>g</italic> support the notion that the expression of IL-2 receptor is inhibited, while mitogen binding and the transmission of IL-1 by accessory cells occur normally. Moreover, Hughes–Fulford’s group analyzed induction of early genes expression in Concanavalin A activated human T cells [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and discovered that the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway is downregulated under microgravity. Transcription factors as NF-κB, AP-1, and CREB are all regulated by PKA and they all suffer dysfunction under altered gravity. These findings indicate that PKA is a key player in gravity-mediated modulation of T cell activation and not just the PKC as believed as far[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
              <p>A systematic approach to understand the causes of the loss of T cell activation was conducted in real microgravity conditions in space and in microgravity conditions simulated by ground facilities, as Fast Rotating Clinostat (FRC)[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Random Positioning Machine (RPM)[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The results obtained in ground facilities were in agreement with those obtained in space. Therefore, for our work we used the Random Positioning Machine, reproducing the experimental model already used in many studies[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] for the investigation of T cell activation as well as cell differentiation in the immune system[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The results obtained revealed that REAC technology effectively reduces the loss of T cell activity in the space and improves the gene expression of IL2 and its IL2-Rα, under simulated microgravity conditions. REAC technology RGN-S treatment protocol could be a potential countermeasure to win the impact of spaceflight stress on the alteration of the immune system experienced by humans in the space environment.</p>

                <title>Microgravity simulation–The Random Positioning Machine (RPM)</title>
                <p>The Random Positioning Machine (RPM) was developed by T. Hoson in Japan and manufactured by Dutch Space (former Fokker Space) in the 1990s[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to simulate weightlessness, in order to study the effects on plants as well as various other cell types. The RPM provided conditions similar to those that occur during exposure of cells to real microgravity inside an International Space Station (10<sup>−2</sup>/ 10<sup>−4</sup>)[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The RPM is an instrument designed to provide an experiment with continuous random orientation changes in 3-dimensional space relatively to Earth’s gravity vector. This three-dimensional movement is achieved by two independently rotating frames. The frames are controlled by a computer, which randomly generates the speed and direction of the frames regardless of the gravity force vector. Biological samples connected to a platform in the middle of the frames experience weightlessness, since they have no time to orient themselves according to the gravity force vector. In our study, the RPM was accommodated in a temperature-controlled room at 37°C, at Biomedical Science Department, University of Sassari, Italy. A box containing the cell cultures sealed in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes, was placed and fixed, as close as possible, at the center of the inner frame of the machine. Eppendorf tubes were used to allow the Asymmetric Conveyer Probe of the REAC device to be immersed in the suspended cells and they were completely filled to avoid the presence of air bubbles, which could lead to shear force damage of the cells on the RPM. A control experiment on ground was also performed: cell cultures, in parallel, were placed at the basement of the RPM, at 1<italic>g</italic> gravity in thermostatic room at 37°C, in static position but continuously turned to prevent them from settling.</p>

                <title>Description of Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer (REAC) Technology</title>
                <p>Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer Technology (REAC) is a technological platform for neuro- and bio-modulation. Its mechanism of action is described in details in Maioli 2016 [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. REAC is an asymmetric technology since there is only one single physical pole (asymmetrical circuit), while a normal electric circuit has two physical poles: one positive and one negative (symmetrical circuit). This unique pole in REAC Technology is the Asymmetric Conveyer Probe (ACP), which becomes the attractor of the currents induced in the body or in cell culture by the radio electric field emitted by the device. The aim of this scheme is to create an asymmetric circuit, which better interacts with the asymmetric mechanism underlying the cell polarity. Acting on cell polarity and optimizing its functions, REAC technology can modulate the current flows both at cellular and body level, when these are altered, exerting a therapeutic effect. Moreover, in order to induce current flows of intensity comparable with those of cell polarity, REAC Technology uses radio electric emission of low power level, because higher power levels would disturb the adjustment mechanisms of cell polarity. The REAC treatment protocol used in this study was the Regenerative (RGN) treatment type S. The radio electric field was generated by a 2.4 GHz emitter. With the ACP immerged in the cell cultures at a distance of 35 cm from the emitter, we measured a radiated power of approximately 400 μW/m<sup>2</sup> Electric fieldσ = 0.4 V/m, magnetic field = 1 mA/m, specific absorption rate (SAR) = 0.128 μW/g; given J = 1 A/Vm, and ρ = 1,000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, the density of radio electric current flowing in the culture medium during a single radiofrequency burst by the REAC is J = 30 μA/cm<sup>2</sup>.The model of REAC device used in this study was B.E.N.E.

                <p>For each independent experiment, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were separated for every different donor, to overcome the individual variation. Each buffy-coat preparation (45ml) of a blood sample (450 ml) drawn from the antecubital vein of a volunteer healthy donor and collected into blood bag containing citrate phosphate dextrose as anticoagulant (obtained from Centro Trasfusionale, Ospedale Civile–Sassari, Italy), was diluted 1:10 with Hank’s buffer (Gibco) just before the separation. PBMCs were separated as resting cells from the peripheral fresh blood according to the Boyum method[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], based on gradient centrifugation at 300x<italic>g</italic>, by means of the density separation medium Histopaque-1077 (SIGMA) and leading to a cell population consisting of (80%) T lymphocytes, (10%) B cells, (5%) monocytes and (5%) granulocytes, indicated as a whole as Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were stored overnight at 37°C inside thermostatic room, in the dark, prior to activation, to avoid causing non-specific activation. This allows the cells to recover from the stress of the isolation. In fact, centrifugation steps lasting 10–30 min at 200x<italic>g</italic> or more may activate certain genes and thus cause artefacts due to hyper gravity stress.</p>

                <p>PBMCs activation can offer a good model for the study of cell differentiation as well as of the cellular aspect of the immune system. For these experiments, PBMCs were resuspended at a density of 6 x 10^6 cells/ml into RPMI-1640 culture medium (GlutaMAXTM, Gibco, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, mycoplasma free, Gibco), 20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 5 mM sodium bicarbonate, 50 μg /ml gentamycin (all purchased from Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Cells were activated by addition of a mitogenic drug, Concanavalin A (Con A, Sigma), at a final concentration of 10 μg /ml and aliquoted into 2ml Eppendorf tubes to a final concentration of 6 x 10^6cells/ml. Con A is a mitogenic drug from lentil seeds of <italic>Canavalia ensiformis</italic> and is known for its ability to stimulate mouse T cell subsets, giving rise to four functionally distinct T cell populations, including precursors to suppressor T cell. Also one subset of human suppressor T cells is sensitive to Con A[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Con A was added immediately before the start of the experiment. Upon exposure to mitogen Con A in culture, T lymphocytes can be selectively activated polyclonally to proliferate and to produce a number of lymphokines. T lymphocytes are activated by mitogens of different origin. Most of the results on T cells activation were obtained with the lectin Con A[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>

                <p>It is important to note that REAC pre-treatment prevents the apoptotic effect of simulated microgravity even at 2h, as shown in the comparison between REAC+RPM and noREAC+RPM (p &lt;0.01). This difference is not observed in the comparison between REAC+GC and noREAC+GC at 2h. (D) The graph shows the total apoptosis of cells post-treated with REAC or untreated, and previously exposed to RPM (blue bars) or left to 1<italic>g</italic> (GC) (green bars) at different experimental time (2–4–12 h). With lowercase letters the significance ratios are indicated respectively between RPM+REAC (a), GC+REAC (b), RPM +noREAC (c) and GC+noREAC (d). In post-treatment, the effect of REAC is more evident, especially in the samples exposed to microgravity in comparison to Ground Control. The difference between RPM+REAC and RPM+noREAC is statistically significant (2h p &lt;0.001; 12h p&lt;0.0001). In RPM+REAC sample, apoptotic cells decrease about 20% at 12 h, compared to RPM+noREAC. In samples left at 1<italic>g</italic>, no difference is observed between REAC or noREAC post-treated cells. This show that REAC is more effective where there is a <strike>insult</strike> damage. In the apoptosis plots, the data describe the total cells in apoptosis, with mean ± SD (with n = 3) *p &lt;0.01, **p &lt;0.001, ***p &lt;0.0001, compared all against all.

                <title>Effect of REAC treatment on IL2Rα gene expression</title>
                <p>As regards REAC pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), we observed that the onset of genetic expression of the IL-2Rα chain in Con A-activated cells begins at a lower level approximately 2 hours after exposure to the mitogen; up to 4 hours, the amount of mRNA remained unchanged and there was no significant difference in the different experimental conditions. Starting from 12 hours, IL-2Rα mRNA levels of REAC treated cells followed by RPM simulated microgravity (REAC+RPM) were increased compared to untreated cells (noREAC+RPM) (p&lt; 0.001). It was also observed that treated samples at 1<italic>g</italic> (REAC+GC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) showed IL-2Rα gene expression statistically significant higher than noREAC+GC sample at all experimental time (2h p&lt;0,01; 4h p&lt;0.001 and 12h p&lt;0.01). We conclude that REAC pre-treatment induces an increase in IL-2Rα gene expression in cells subsequently cultured under simulated microgravity at 12 hours. In fact, REAC pre-treatment seems to improve the adaptation to simulated microgravity in samples exposed to RPM (REAC+RPM) compared to untreated samples also exposed to simulated microgravity (noREAC+RPM) (p &lt;0.001), in early experimental time (2, 4 h). As regards the REAC post-treated subsets of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), we observed that cells exposed to simulated microgravity and subsequently REAC treated (RPM+REAC) showed an increase of IL-2Rα mRNA levels starting from 4 hours up to 12 hours in comparison with untreated samples that show a higher level of mRNA at the earliest experimental 2 hours activation time but the lowest at 12 hours (RPM+noREAC) (p&lt; 0,0000001). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) No difference was observed between samples kept at 1g gravity and then REAC treated (GC+REAC) or untreated (GC+noREAC) at 12h, whereas we observed a significative difference at 4h (p&lt;0.001). The same trend was also observed with respect to IL 2 post- treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>), showing that gene expression is not influenced by REAC treatment in samples before kept at 1g gravity conditions during their activation. It can be deduced that REAC treatment is more effective in cells subjected to a stress during their activation, as altered gravitational environment, (RPM+REAC) compared to untreated cells (RPM+noREAC).</p>

                <p>In another set of experiments, we evaluated the effect of REAC-RGN-S treatment after culturing cells in simulated microgravity conditions for 2, 4 and 12 hours (REAC-post treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> shows the effect of REAC treatment on IL-2 gene expression in cells REAC treated before exposition to simulated microgravity (RPM) or normal gravity condition (GC). REAC pre-treated cells subsequently exposed to simulated microgravity (REAC+RPM) exhibited a higher level of IL-2 mRNA at 4 hours of culture in simulated microgravity, being still higher also at 4,12 hours of simulated microgravity, as compared to the correspondent REAC untreated cells (noREAC+RPM) (p&lt;0.01). Also in this case, as expected according to our previous reports, IL-2 mRNA levels are decreased in RPM untreated cells (noREAC+RPM) in later experimental time (4,12h). As regards REAC post-treatment effect, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref> shows IL-2 gene expression analysis on cells cultured in different simulated microgravity conditions and then treated with REAC technology. The genetic expression of the IL-2 begins at a lower level approximately 2 hours after exposure to the mitogen; up to 4 hours, the amount of mRNA remained unchanged also there was significant difference in the different experimental conditions compared to untreated sample (RPM+noREAC). Starting from 4 hours and much more at 12 hours, IL-2 mRNA levels of REAC treated cells after RPM simulated microgravity exposure (RPM+REAC) was highly increased compared to untreated cells (RPM+noREAC) (p&lt; 0.001). On the other hand, we observed that the difference between REAC post-treated and untreated cells cultured in normal gravity condition (GC+REAC) (GC+noREAC) decrease during the time course analyzed from 2 at 12h where the conditions REAC untreated (GC+noREAC) were a few increases than GC+REAC (P&lt;0.05). Considering these results, we can conclude that REAC treatment can significantly modify both IL-2 and IL-2Rα gene expression and rescue the inhibitory effect induced by microgravity, in manner time dependent.</p>

                <p>The benefit of the REAC pre-treatment can be observed already between 2h-4h and increases after 4h (2.24±0.25 vs. 0.9±0.2, p&lt;0.001), in particular up to 12h (35. 57±1.5 vs. 24.88±1.2, p&lt; 0.001), which is the "end point" of the experiment when Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) have a sudden increase in the expression of IL-2Rα. REAC pre-treatment effect increased after 4h, namely the moment of increased expression of cell membrane markers induced in response to the mitogenic stimulus of activation. It can be stated that REAC pre-treatment for 2-4-12h has a better effect on cellular system subsequently exposed to an environmental stress such as the simulated microgravity (REAC+RPM), compared to untreated one (noREAC+RPM). Yet, REAC can also improve the performance of cells subsequently kept for 2-4-12h at 1<italic>g</italic> gravity conditions at the time of expression of the IL2Rα (REAC+GC), in comparison with respective ground control REAC untreated cells (noREAC+GC). In particular, we can observe a significant increase of IL2Rα expression percentage already after 4h (4.32±0.26 vs. 1.3±0.2, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, in the REAC untreated samples (no REAC+GC and noREAC+RPM), that were our controls in the processing, cell expression of IL2Rα showed no differences between 2 and 4h, it starts to increase after 4 hours (1.3±0.2 vs. 0.9±0.2, p&lt;0.01), grows up to 12h (31.87±1.24 vs. 24.88±1.23, p&lt; 0.001) and it is greater at 1<italic>g</italic> conditions (noREAC+GC), if compared to RPM simulated microgravity (noREAC+RPM).

It can be stated that if the cells were subjected to a stress during their activation, as altered gravitational environment (RPM+REAC), the effect of REAC treatment is positive in respect of the activation parameters, such as IL2Rα, which is one of the first molecules expressed during the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells activation, when compared to REAC untreated cells (RPM+noREAC). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200128.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) On the other hand, if the cellular system does not undergo any stress following the activation stimulus (GC+REAC), REAC treatment shows to be ineffective if compared to REAC untreated ground control (GC+noREAC) (21.28±0.37 vs. 25.63±0.5, p&lt; 0.001).</p>

              <p>Immunosuppression and weakened T cell immune response during spaceflight are a major barrier to safe, long-term human space habitation and travel[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All this can be counteracted by a good maintenance and modulation of T cell polarity[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is well known that in vivo activation of naive or resting T cells initiated by the binding of a foreign antigen, can be mimicked in vitro by the use of several agents or by concanavalin A (Con A) alone, as activator of T cells, in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Upon exposure to mitogen Con A in culture, PBMCs can be selectively activated polyclonally to proliferate and to produce a number of lymphokines. In particular, when exposed to Con A for at least 2 h, they will transcribe and secrete interleukin-2 (IL-2). The regulation of the transcription of the IL-2 gene is based on complex and still obscure mechanisms involving transcription factors such as NFAT, AP-1, NF-kB and others, and it is object of extensive studies, extensively reviewed[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The protein expression of immediate-early genes, within 30 min of activation, in turn activates IL-2 expression[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The expression of IL-2 induces synthesis of IL-2Rα; both are essential for efficient immune response, T cell proliferation and progression from the G0 to G1 phase[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The low gravity environment of spaceflight has proven to lead to impaired T cell activation and profoundly down regulated transcription[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] of immediate early genes. These results demonstrated and confirmed that reduced gravity can perturb molecular signals leading to impaired immune function. DNA array analysis of T cells subjected to RPM microgravity revealed an alteration of several signal modules, in particular NF-kB and MAPK-signaling [<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A number of potential, gravity-sensitive mechanisms are implicated in the impairment of T cell activation and proliferation in spaceflight, but they are at least in part a result of decreased IL-2 and IL-2Rα induction. We examined gene expression and synthesis of IL-2 as well as IL-2Rα subunits at early time points following activation and characterized the global gene expression of activated T cells in micro-gravity after 4h of activation[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This time-point was determined to be the peak for IL-2 expression post activation. In fact, significant up regulation of IL-2 and IL-2Rα was observed during T cell activation by 4h, while there was significant inhibition in micro-gravity[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We also studied the time course of gene expression after T cell activation and the pattern of how micro-gravity inhibits the first wave of immediate early genes with downstream effects on a wider range of secondary response genes. Among genes found to be down-regulated significantly in simulated micro-gravity, compared with 1<italic>g</italic>, which became detectable at 4h of activation, are included IL-2 IL-2Rα[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The goal of the present experiments was to verify if REAC-RGN-S treatment could be an effective countermeasure against the loss of T cell activity in space. Based on the results of this paper, the most important conclusion we can draw is that if T cells suffered a stress, such as weightlessness, during their activation, the effect of REAC-RGN-S treatment is positive in respect of the activation parameters. We can hypothesize that REAC acts as a T cell polarity optimizer[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], remodulating the cell signal transduction pathways altered by reduced gravity, probably acting on gravity-sensitive cellular targets, where the lipid-raft-associated membrane-proximal signalosome complex is located[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Acting on ion fluxes at molecular level, REAC is likely to affect the release of intracellular stored calcium in the endoplasmic reticulum, involved in the activation of the protein kinase C (PKC). REAC effect on stored calcium is likely to be involved also in the regulation of lymphocyte locomotory activity, which under microgravity culture conditions is inhibited, as calcium signal was shown to be a directionality marker for the orientation of neutrophils locomotion[<xref rid="pone.0200128.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0200128.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The extensive research on immune cells in culture under different gravity conditions and treated with REAC technology could contribute significantly to the understanding of T cell growth responsiveness in space and may aid in the individuation of a potential countermeasure to win the impact of weightlessness on the alteration of the immune system experienced by humans during long duration missions.</p>
