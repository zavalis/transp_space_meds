              <abstract>
                <p><bold>Background:</bold> Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (<italic toggle="yes">met1-7)</italic> and elongator complex subunit 2 (<italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic>)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control.</p>
                <p><bold>Results:</bold> The <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic>. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic>.</p>
                <p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Plants cope with environmental changes by reprogramming gene expression and metabolic processes necessary for growth, development, and survival (e.g., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Sewelam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Lopez-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>). The adaptability of a genotype to changing environmental conditions is therefore determined by its genome and gene activity, both of which are in turn influenced by epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation (e.g., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The APEX-04 EPEX spaceflight experiment investigated the role of specific epigenomic changes in determining the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment.</p>
              <p>DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in: <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bartels et al., 2018</xref>). Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Labra et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Boyko and Kovalchuk, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Mirouze and Paszkowski, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bilichak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Colaneri and Jones, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Tricker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hewezi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bartels et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Beyrne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Ashapkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Akhter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Korotko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Laanen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Villagomez-Aranda et al., 2021</xref>). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Hoson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Salmi and Roux, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Blancaflor, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Zupanska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ferl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Inglis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Schüler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ferl and Paul, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Califar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Angelos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Manian et al., 2021b</xref>). Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment (<xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p>The patterns of spaceflight-associated DNA methylation are organ-specific. In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Tameshige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Jarosz et al., 2020</xref>). Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Schüler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Herranz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Califar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Manian et al., 2021a</xref>). This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight?</p>
              <p>DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chevalier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Pikaard, 2013</xref>). In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> DNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Matzke et al., 2015</xref>). In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts (<xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Woloszynska et al., 2016</xref>). To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases.</p>
              <p>The cytosine DNA methyl transferase gene, Met1, is directly involved in the maintenance of cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis, particularly at CG sites (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Kankel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Rigal et al., 2016</xref>). MET1 is one of several methylation enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of stress responses (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Naydenov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Yong-Villalobos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Dhami and Cazzonelli, 2020</xref>). The role MET1 plays in maintaining the CG methylation profile is also important for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Saze et al., 2003</xref>). Loss of MET1 function non-specifically enhances resistance to bacterial infections (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Kankel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>). Many of the genes differentially regulated in methylation-mutant <italic toggle="yes">met1-3</italic> lines (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Material</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>) show a substantial overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) including genes involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome profiles establish that differential methylation in the genome is central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Dowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2012</xref>), suggesting the hypothesis that the stress response elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis may also have an epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1.</p>
              <p>The Elongator complex is composed of six protein subunits that are highly conserved among eukaryotes; it acts as a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and has several unique cellular functions, including tRNA modification, DNA modification, and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Nelissen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Glatt and Muller, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Mou, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Kolaj-Robin and Seraphin, 2017</xref>). Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Mou, 2015</xref>) the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Glatt and Muller, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Jarosz et al., 2020</xref>). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Woloszynska et al., 2016</xref>). Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery (<xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Woloszynska et al., 2016</xref>). In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g., <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Xie and Yu, 2015</xref>), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in: <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Jarosz et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p>ELP2 is associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>) and plays a role in root development (e.g., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>), The role of ELP2 in plant pathogen defense is relevant to the spaceflight response in plants as many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome are also commonly associated with terrestrial pathogen responses (e.g., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 2020</xref>). Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">DeFraia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2017</xref>). Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">DeFraia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2017</xref>), and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>) and auxin signaling (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Nelissen et al., 2010</xref>). Many of the genes differentially expressed between <italic toggle="yes">elp2</italic> mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Further, many of the genes differentially expressed in <italic toggle="yes">elp2</italic> mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). These roles for ELP2 in pathogen responses and abiotic stresses suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of the spaceflight response pathways in plants.</p>
              <p>The Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EPEX) spaceflight experiment reported herein investigated the contribution of epigenomic changes in the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment, specifically the role of cytosine DNA methylation in the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis.

                <p>Ten plates (nine for installation in Veggie and one spare) per genotype for each environmental condition (flight and GC) were prepared for launch. The plates were stored at 4°C and remained dormant until their installation into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS, and a comparable set was installed into the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy space center. Plants in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 μmoles/m<sup>2</sup>s PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space center fixation tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlater<sup>TM</sup> (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at −80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard −80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope. FromBioanalyzer and quantified with the each plate, the materials from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction. Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost, (<italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic>, spaceflight C6) and so one of the spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather than two plates.

DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (&lt;100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction.

Low-quality bases were trimmed from the reads using Trimmomatic (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). STAR Aligner was used to map high-quality paired-end reads to TAIR10 genome (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink et al., 2016</xref>). Gene expression values were calculated from these alignments using RSEM (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>). The expected read counts and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) were extracted for further analysis. A generalized linear regression model was built to perform the differential gene analysis using edgeR (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Prior to the differential expression analysis, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify potential outliers in the samples. The thresholds for calling significantly DEG were set at, FDR of 0.05, a fold change of greater than 2, and the average FPKM for at least one replicate of each comparison group being higher than 0. DEG lists were analyzed for overlaps using BioVenn (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Hulsen et al., 2008</xref>). Processing and Analysis of the RNASeq data was performed at the UF ICBR Bioinformatics Core<sup><xref rid="footnote3" ref-type="fn">3</xref></sup>.</p>

                <p>The three genotypes, Col-0, <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> each demonstrated different growth habits in response to spaceflight. <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> shows a representative plate of each genotype grown on the ISS (spaceflight, FT) and comparable GC.

The strong directional growth light gradient in Veggie produces a negative phototropism in roots that results in root growth that largely mimics terrestrial gravitropism (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Califar et al., 2020</xref>). For both Col-0 and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> the spaceflight (FT) roots adopt a slightly randomized growth habit compared to the GCs, yet extend well away from the site of germination and the stem, and are generally negatively phototropic in response to the “vertical” orientation of the plates relative to the light source in the Veggie growth habitat. The Col-0 and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants presented healthy visual phenotypes, where their leaves were fully expanded and green.</p>
                <p>In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants exhibit spaceflight growth patterns that were distinct from both Col-0 wild-type and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic>, and did not appear to be responding to the environmental tropic cues directing roots away from the lights in Veggie (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The roots of <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> in spaceflight did not exhibit any directional growth. Instead, all root growth appeared to occur in random patterns that resulted in most of the root mass staying within 1 cm of the germinated seed. The spaceflight leaves of <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> tended to be darker, with more of the plants exhibiting reddish coloration typical of anthocyanin production. Several of the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> leaves on each of the spaceflight plates were chlorotic.</p>
                <p>In spite of any morphological differences among the genotypes, all produced the same biomass in spaceflight as on the ground.

In Col-0 leaves and roots, the number of DMRs in all genic regions and context was less than 400, with the highest number of DMRs found within the CHH context. In gene-related DMRs in Col-0 leaves hypo- and hypermethylation were fairly evenly distributed across all contexts, whereas in Col-0 roots, gene-related DMRs were mostly hypomethylated (70%). In Col-0 leaves and roots, gene-related DMRs were most abundant in the gene body region. In contrast to wild-type Col-0, the total gene-related DMRs in <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> were substantially higher in the roots compared to the leaves. In <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> roots, DMRs were primarily in the CHH context and were predominantly hypermethylated in all genic regions. The highest number of DMRs in the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> roots were within the gene body region. In <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic>, DMRs were found at a higher number in the leaves compared to the roots. DMRs in both leaves and roots were predominantly hypermethylated and were distributed primarily in the CG context. In <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> leaves, the highest number of DMRs were located upstream of the TSS (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>

GO analysis of the DmC-DEGs of <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> compared to Col-0 showed that <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> was engaged with many processes characteristic of stress responses (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Processes shared as enriched between leaf and root DmC-DEGs included general responses to stimuli, oxidoreductase activities, and heme-binding. Leaf-specific DmC-DEGs were enriched in biosynthetic processes of flavonoids and pigments, jasmonic acid, and wounding responses in both GC and FT. DmC-DEGs in GC leaves were more specifically enriched in phenylpropanoid metabolism and the response to oxidative stress, as well as in further oxidoreducatase and peroxidase activities. DmC-DEGs in FT leaves were enriched with defense and hypoxia responses. DmC-DEGs annotated to the plasma membrane and extracellular structures were enriched among both GC and FT roots, in addition to transport processes and activities. Carbohydrate transport and binding were specifically enriched among root GC DmC-DEGs.

Physiological adaptation to spaceflight engages gene expression changes that at least mimic several terrestrial stress responses (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Hoson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Salmi and Roux, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Blancaflor, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Correll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Zupanska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ferl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Inglis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Sugimoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Schüler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Barker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). In addition, the first whole-genome survey of DNA methylation in wild-type WS Arabidopsis plants grown entirely in the spaceflight environment showed correlated changes in DNA methylation accompanying regulation of DEGs in spaceflight, especially in stress response genes such as those associated with defense responses and ROS signaling (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). However, such correlations do not establish a functional connection between DNA methylation and physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Therefore, two methylation mutant lines, each deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation, were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type. The assays for response to spaceflight were overall growth and morphology, gene expression profiles, and DNA methylation profiles.</p>
              <p>The <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants failed to grow normally in spaceflight (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous experiments have shown that in the microgravity of spaceflight, plant root growth is altered compared to growth on the ground, yet when presented with directional light, roots generally grow away from the light source and establish a near normal growth pattern, and present a generally healthy-looking morphology (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). However, the roots of the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants in spaceflight did not set up this typical spaceflight directionality, as the roots did not navigate away from the germinated seed. The total biomass of the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants on orbit was similar to that of the GCs (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Thus, all of the biomass of the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> spaceflight plants was concentrated into the area very near the seed, which may accelerate the depletion of nutrients in the immediate vicinity of germination. Nutrient depletion stress is also apparent in the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> spaceflight transcriptome. The leaves of the spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants appeared to be less expanded, more chlorotic and displayed more reddish pigmentation than the leaves of the GCs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> mutants generally exhibit over-accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which can be further exacerbated by stress (<xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). This distinct, spaceflight-dependent, morphology for <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants suggests that <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants are physiologically maladapted to spaceflight. While it has been established that ELP2 has a role in root development (e.g., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>) the spaceflight data suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in gravity perception and root navigation. In terrestrial environments, where gravity can impart a tropic force, plants lacking ELP2 have shorter roots but grow reasonably well (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). However, in the absence of gravity, <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> mutant roots appear to lose the ability to navigate effectively away from the site of the germinating seed.</p>
              <p>The <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants appeared better able to cope with the absence of gravity than <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants, as their spaceflight root growth patterns were similar to Col-0, with no obvious deleterious morphologies seen on orbit (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants produced as much biomass on orbit as in the GCs (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) and established a root growth pattern that was visually typical of spaceflight growth (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) and similar to the appearance of Col-0 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
              <p>The differential spaceflight morphologies of <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> suggest that the DNA methylation events conditioned by MET1 and ELP2 differentially affect spaceflight physiological adaptation and success. Since MET1 and ELP2 represent two different mechanisms that affect methylation, these results suggest that spaceflight might affect the methylation of specific genes more than the genome-wide status of methylation.</p>
              <p>The degree of genome-wide methylation was not statistically different between spaceflight and GCs for Col-0, but both <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> were generally hypermethylated compared to the GCs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 1</xref>). This result reinforces the conclusion that changes in overall average genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild-type plants, as this result was also seen in the spaceflight methylome of Arabidopsis cultivar WS (<xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). However, the hypermethylation of the mutant genomes suggested that the respective contributions of MET1 and ELP2 are important to maintaining an appropriate degree of genome-wide methylation in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The degree of DNA methylation within each context in <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> was significantly increased in response to spaceflight in both leaves and roots (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G,H</xref>) compared to the degree of methylation of these mutants with respect to wild type in the GCs. However, there was a distinction between the two mutant lines in the degree and context of methylation in the respective root genomes. The spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> root genome was significantly hypermethylated in all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH) compared to the GCs, whereas only CG methylation was elevated in the spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> genome (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D,H,J</xref>). Although the contribution of CHG and CHH methylation in Arabidopsis is generally small (about 14%; <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Niederhuth et al., 2016</xref>) it is possible that while genome-wide changes in CG methylation does not impact spaceflight root growth morphology, changes in the CHG and CHH context may contribute to the spaceflight phenotype of <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants.</p>
              <p>The degree of spaceflight methylation across protein-coding regions showed organ-specificity among all genotypes. Methylation in the protein coding regions is relevant to gene expression profiles, which are also highly organ specific. Spaceflight induced more CG methylation across all protein-coding regions (upstream, gene body, and downstream) in <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> leaves and only increased methylation in the upstream and downstream regions in roots (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Conversely, <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> methylation was increased across all protein-coding regions and methylation contexts only in the roots in response to spaceflight (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The substantial increase in CHH methylation in <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> roots (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A,B</xref>) suggests that ELP2 plays a dominant role in governing the spaceflight-associated methylation changes in the roots, specifically in the CHH context. This correlates with the root growth morphology exhibited by <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic>.</p>
              <p>Col-0, <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> are each different in their spaceflight gene expression and DNA methylation profiles. The profiles of differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes in both <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> were unique compared to wild-type Col-0 (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figures 10</xref>, <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> and <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The loss of MET1 and ELP2 each had a substantial influence on the profiles of DEGs and differentially methylated genes in response to the spaceflight environment. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> spaceflight plants indicate that the spaceflight plants are under considerable stress compared to GCs. Almost a third of the genes uniquely induced in the spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> leaves are associated with nutrient stress, and most of the rest are genes associated with heat stress, ROS and pathogen responses. These gene classes were also noticeably represented among the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> spaceflight root DEGs. These gene expression patterns describe a highly stressed response reflecting the compact growth morphology of the spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> spaceflight plants suggest that <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants were better adjusted to spaceflight than the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants. As with the <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants, the <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants present a number of stress-associated DEGs. However, in contrast to the types of genes expressed by spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plants, the DEGs in spaceflight <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> plants predominantly functioned in signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators (<xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary File 6</xref>).</p>
              <p>While organ-specific differences in the gene expression patterns of various Arabidopsis tissue types (leaves, hypocotyls, roots, and root tips) have been previously reported in spaceflight transcriptomes (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Paul et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), the <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> plant lines each demonstrated a different pattern of organ-specific expression and methylation. A large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves were observed in Col-0 (59 out of 207) and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> (72 out of 226), whereas in roots a large proportion of differentially methylated and expressed genes were found in Col-0 (114 out of 147) and <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> (101 out of 120). Only 8% of the leaf DEGs and 12% of the root DEGs overlap between the genotypes, suggesting that unique organ-specific mechanisms were engaged for spaceflight adaptation, with MET1 playing a more important role in leaves and ELP2 having the more important role in roots, in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight.</p>
              <p>The relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression in spaceflight were complex and differed between leaves and roots. In wild-type Col-0 leaves, the hypomethylated DmCs and hypermethylated DmCs were evenly distributed across all contexts and all genic regions (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The association of changes in methylation with gene expression showed an even proportion of positive and negative correlation. In <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> leaves, DmCs were predominantly hypermethylated in the CG and CHH contexts of downstream regions, and a larger proportion of positive correlations were observed among DmC-DEGs (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). In <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> roots, DmCs were primarily hypermethylated in the CHH context across all genic regions, yet a larger proportion of DmC-DEGs showed a negative correlation (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>). These observations are in contrast with other studies that report a strong negative correlation between promoter CG methylation and gene expression levels (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Finnegan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Garg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). Further investigations may clarify the relationship between leaf spaceflight transcript abundance and methylation in different contexts and genic regions. However, 80% of DEGs (across all genotypes) were also differentially methylated in roots. In leaves, that average was only 30% (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). These data suggest that DNA methylation plays a significantly larger role in regulating the genes associated with the spaceflight response in roots than in leaves.</p>
              <p>The genes differentially regulated by <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> in spaceflight were from distinctly different metabolic processes than those regulated in Col-0 in response to spaceflight. Functional analyses of DmC-DEGs showed sharp contrasts among <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> with the Col-0 wild-type. The mutant e<italic toggle="yes">lp2-5</italic> line showed differential methylation and expression of gene classes traditionally associated with the spaceflight response and other abiotic stresses, such as metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses across tissue types (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Cramer et al., 2011</xref>). The mutant <italic toggle="yes">met1-7</italic> line, conversely, demonstrated relatively few GO term enrichments, indicating that DmC-DEGs tended to result from largely untargeted changes in methylation (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). ELP2 regulates root growth and development, and <italic toggle="yes">elp2</italic> loss of function mutants display shorter roots, and this phenotype may be linked to the root-specific involvement of DmC-DEGs associated with ion homeostasis, transport processes, and extracellular localization observed in this study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>, 8E; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). The spaceflight-associated processes that are differentially represented in <italic toggle="yes">elp2-5</italic> are also among the primary classes enriched in DmC-DEGs involved in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0 (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8E</xref>, <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). These data suggest that the spaceflight response works more directly through DNA methylation mechanisms and other mechanisms regulated by ELP2 than through the maintenance mechanisms represented by MET1.</p>
              <p>DNA methylation profiles within a genome are dynamic and complex, yet integral to plant growth, development, and stress responses (reviewed in: <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bartels et al., 2018</xref>). The response to spaceflight includes differential DNA methylation in a manner that is similar to known terrestrial stress responses, particularly those associated with pathogen attack or harsh environments. <xref rid="DS1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref> provides a comparison of these spaceflight-associated DmC-DEGs with those from several terrestrial studies of environmental stress responses (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Yong-Villalobos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Hewezi et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Stassen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Korotko et al., 2021</xref>). This correlation strongly suggests that the spaceflight response, though novel, utilizes a range of mechanistic approaches that are typically employed during terrestrial environmental stress. While direct methylation mechanisms represented by MET1 certainly affect the spaceflight response in terms of gene expression profiles, the indirect DNA demethylation/methylation mechanisms associated with ELP2 have a more profound role than MET1 in the spaceflight response.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Genetic factors that influence genome DNA methylation directly impact physiological adaptation to spaceflight, affecting overall growth in space as well as the specifics of the spaceflight gene response profile. Genome methylation is therefore important for spaceflight responses in much the same way as it is important for adaptation to terrestrial stresses. In particular, processes regulated by ELP2 appear critical for proper root directional development in spaceflight. The remodeling of the Arabidopsis methylome in spaceflight, together with the negative outcomes of interfering with DNA methylation, suggests that epigenetic marking is a fundamental part of environmental responses, even during novel environmental stresses outside of the evolutionary history of plants.</p>
