Cancer cells have been shown to die under microgravity. This can be exploited for better understanding of the biology and identification of novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Here, we described the effect of microgravity simulated using Rotational Cell Culture System-High Aspect Ratio Vessel (RCCS-HARV) on the viability and morphological changes of colorectal cancer cells. We observed DLD1, HCT116 and SW620 cells die through apoptosis under simulated microgravity (SM). Gene expression analysis on DLD1 cells showed upregulation of tumor suppressors PTEN and FOXO3; leading to AKT downregulation and further induction of apoptosis, through upregulation of CDK inhibitors CDKN2B, CDKN2D. SM induced cell clumps had elevated hypoxia and mitochondrial membrane potential that led to adaptive responses like morphogenetic changes, migration and deregulated autophagy, when shifted to normal culture conditions. This can be exploited to understand the three-dimensional (3D) biology of cancer in the aspect of stress response. This study highlights the regulation of cell function and viability under microgravity through PTEN/FOXO3/AKT pathway.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and major health concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The failure of treatment of CRC is mainly due to the lack of information on its complexity in multi-factorial heterogeneity in mutations and microenvironment that cumulatively drive the survival strategy of CRC. The unique environment involving lining of functional endothelial cells in gastrointestinal tract adds value to the need of understanding the niche and physical forces involved in driving these tumors. Mechanical stimuli and stress has been shown to affect cell behavior in healthy and pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Especially in the process of metastasis and cancer stemness, physical factors of interstitial fluid pressure and matrix stiffness play a major role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Information about the effect of physical factors to cells on a three-dimensional (3D) scale is minimal, and that regarding the influence of gravity on the disease condition is negligible.</p>
              <p id="Par3">The role of gravity in determining cellular function and properties is more clearly depicted in the microgravity condition, which induces muscle atrophy and immune dysfunction and various other ailments in astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The change in gravity affects different cell types differently with either increase or decrease in function and viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Microgravity induces cell clumps and is a robust model for developing scaffold assisted and scaffold free 3D culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Jessup J. M. <italic>et al</italic>. showed increased cell adhesion and structural formations along with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in mip101<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Ground simulation is attained using Rotational Cell Culture System- High Aspect Ratio Vessel (RCCS-HARV), Clinorotation and Random positioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, moreover Simulated Microgravity (SM) has been shown to influence apoptosis in various cancer types, mostly through cytoskeleton dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our previous study, we observed cell death of DLD1 cells when subjected to SM, also we showed a wide array of genes deregulated, with cell cycle genes downregulated and transcriptional regulation genes upregulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We observed a possible role of AKT reduction under microgravity from the microarray.</p>
              <p id="Par4">AKT activation is related to poor prognosis in CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, also it is the driver for cell survival mechanisms contributing to cancer progression and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. PTEN inhibits AKT activation and subsequent nuclear translocation, activating FOXO resulting in tumor suppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This favors autophagy mediated stress adaptation, a key process in drug resistance in CRC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesize that PTEN-FOXO3 axis is critical in mediating stress signaling in the scaffold free 3D spheroids from microgravity. Further, we have evaluated the role of tumor suppressors under 3D microenvironment in SM, their role in mediating stress induced cell death and adaptive measures during stress removal.</p>

                <p id="Par5">Colorectal cancer cells subjected to microgravity start to form miniscule clumps at 6–8 hours, which increase in size and form spheroids of ~200 μm to ~1 mm, which clump together to form massive 3D structures with loose arrangement of cells. By 48 hours, DLD1 and HCT116 cells formed such clumps of ~0.5 cm diameter, while SW620 cells formed smaller clumps of ~200 μm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–f</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These large 3D aggregates come off spontaneously while handling and dissociate into smaller spheroids in culture. This observation parallels with the results of space and ground experiments which have shown microgravity induced clumping in various cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The clumps were mostly intertwined with thread like appendages along which cells roll and form the clumps and spheroids.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Simulation of microgravity induces cell clumping.

Microgravity induces cell death in most cancer cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In our experiment, we observed cell death in all the CRC cell types studied.</p>
                <p id="Par7">From viability assay, ~20% viability was observed in SW620 and HCT116 cells whereas around ~40% viability was seen in DLD1 cells simulated with microgravity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>). Cell cycle analysis revealed that cell death is through G1 cell cycle arrest, subsequent significant Sub G0 population (&gt;40%) in all cell types subjected to SM. A moderate reduction in S and G2M phases were observed, and the cell death corresponds to the G1 phase arrest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–f,g</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Microgravity significantly increases Sub-G0 population.

There was significant early and late apoptotic population in cells under SM. Necrotic population of ~10% in DLD1 and HCT116 cells while ~20% in SW620 cells were also observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This may be due to hypoxic core existing in the large clumps and spheroids. The reduction in cell growth extended when the SM cells were shifted to normal gravity. These cells had lower colony forming capability (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–d</xref>) with SW620 cells greatly affected as compared to DLD1 and HCT116 cells. The DLD1 and HCT116 cells recovered growth rate when transferred to normal conditions, providing the right platform to study the molecular effects of the microgravity.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Cell death in microgravity is majorly through apoptosis. The box plot for the AnnexinV FITC &amp; PI staining for DLD1 (<bold>a</bold>), HCT116 (<bold>d</bold>) and SW620 (<bold>g</bold>) shows that major cell death during SM is induced through apoptosis.

                <title>Adaptive responses of DLD1 to microgravity</title>
                <p id="Par11">3D environment allows cells to exhibit phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of <italic>in-vivo</italic> condition minimally. The growth rate is reduced in 3D environment compared to 2D tissue culture plate owing to the increased physical constraints for cellular expansion. The reduced cell growth under SM was rescued when the DLD1 clumps were shifted to normal gravity and started to form colonies within two weeks’ time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Moreover, these cells exhibited extensive cell-cell communication through cell-cell bridges (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). A significant number of large multinucleated cells were observed in these cultures which were absent in the control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Some cells among the shifted clumps were polarized and directional, and tightly packed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). These structural features were absent when the clumps were trypsinized and seeded onto tissue culture plate and cultured for the same period of time (data not shown). On prolonged culture over a period of two months with subsequent passaging, we observed that some rare cells among SS cells formed tight colonies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), unlike other microgravity simulated cells, which eventually formed elaborate 3D structures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d–h</xref>).

AKT inhibition causes G2M arrest under normal and SM conditions, which was also seen in the bpV-SM group. Such cell cycle arrest is absent when cells were simulated with microgravity without any intervention (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

                <p id="Par15">We performed western blots and fluorescent imaging to assess the extent of the pathway modifications involved with microgravity. The protein level of AKT was diminished, along with the phosphorylated forms pAKTs473 and pAKTt308. In corroboration, the phosphorylated form of GSK-3β, a marker for the progression of AKT pathway, levels were also diminished. PTEN, its phosphorylation at serine 380 and FOXO3 were upregulated during microgravity and maintained under shift condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a–c</xref>).

This supports a conclusion that cellular adaptive responses under SM are mediated by regulations in the protein turnover, rather than mRNA expression. Fluorescence imaging of SS DLD1 showed a similar scenario as western blots. AKT and its phosphorylated forms were downregulated in microgravity whereas FOXO3 was significantly high. But the prolonged culture of SS showed upregulation of AKT, phosphorylated forms and FOXO3 significant than the control cells housing a different scenario than the SM cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d–o</xref>). Thus, indicating the changes was specific to SM. With our findings, it is clear that the SM alters the growth/differentiation control elements FOXO3/PTEN/AKT.

LC3B II levels were critically increased in SM indicating autophagosome formation. But p62 (sequestrome1) was high in SM indicating problems in the maturation of the formed autophagosomes (Sup.

Our results were in corroboration with previous reports of apoptosis mediated cell death in CRC cells studied. The reduction in cell cycle during microgravity is mainly attributed to the disruption of the cytoskeletal elements resulting in G1 arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Our results clearly show a shift of the pathways involved in cell growth towards quiescence and differentiation when CRC cells were subjected to SM. Molecular analysis revealed downregulation of AKT mediated growth mechanism and upregulation of PTEN/FOXO3 mediated stress survival, in DLD1 cells under SM. The PTEN/FOXO3/AKT axis is a main regulator of the fate in cancer cells. The complete removal of functional PTEN is seen in advanced stage of cancer, especially gall bladder, prostrate and colorectal cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par20">But recent evidences show that the role of PTEN and FOXO extend beyond the well understood canonical tumor suppressive ones. PTEN regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated cell senescence and DNA damage, and in its absence, the supporting effect of premature senescence to apoptosis is averted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, also the nuclear localization of PTEN is governed by redox stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. FOXO is pinned for its regulation of cancer stemness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

              <p id="Par21">Involvement of FOXO in microgravity is imminent, but less explored and understood. Muscle atrophy is normally associated with space travel. This condition is critically dependent on FOXO activation and its subsequent effects on autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Hyun W. Ryu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> observed increased autophagy under SM. Upregulation of AKT and subsequent migration and tube formation were seen in HUVECS subjected to clinorotation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In random positioning of MDAMB-231, AKT is downregulated in clumps and upregulated in cell that did not form clump as compared to control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These contrasting results make the role of AKT in microgravity unclear. AKT is known to be upregulated under hypoxia. The formation of spheroid induces hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, but inverse is observed in microgravity proposing a cytosolic regulation over the AKT mediated growth pathway.</p>
              <p id="Par22">We observed that the overall pathway of AKT is altered. Total and phosphorylated forms of AKT as well as the phosphorylated form of GSK-3β were downregulated. AKT promotes cell proliferation through phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 21 and its subsequent inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The downregulation of AKT pathway is accompanied with increased PTEN expression (canonical inhibitor of AKT activation) and its activated form pPTENs380. Subsequently FOXO3, (nuclear antagonist of AKT) is also overexpressed. Interestingly, the expression at the protein level is not supported at transcriptional level. There was constant overexpression of <italic>AKT</italic> mRNA along with <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>FOXO3</italic>, proposing an environment for <italic>AKT</italic> expression and function. Inhibitor studies enlightened that the observed G0 population was merely an additive effect of AKT inhibition present in both normal gravity and SM, compared to uninhibited cells under SM. Whereas, PTEN inhibition showed a contrasting effect between normal and SM in Sub G0 population. Significant G2-M phase arrest under AKT or PTEN inhibition followed by SM and not under normal gravity was seen. This G2M arrest was not present in uninhibited SM cells. This shows PTEN mediated regulation over AKT takes the center stage under microgravity survival. These observations lead to hypothesize that, the physiological effects of microgravity are mediated through FOXO/PTEN/AKT axis and is proven from our study.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par33">Our results highlight the role of PTEN/FOXO3/AKT axis in the control of cell fate during and after SM. The cell death under SM is mediated through CDKNs upregulation through tumor suppressors FOXO3 and PTEN. This is the first evidence of upregulation of PTEN under the influence of change in gravitational forces. Here we found a deregulation in the autophagy flux under simulated microgravity, further analysis can lead to better understanding of the role of physical factors that control autophagy flux. The effect of stress removal on the DLD1 cells resulted in complications of adaptive measures including migration and morphogenetic differentiation, two key features of metastatic cancers. Understanding this stress response mechanism in cancer, especially the role of tumor suppressors under stress and stress removal is essential for traversing hurdles of resistance development. Confirmation of the same pathway in disease free model can further lead to intervention of deleterious effects of space travel.</p>

The clumps were either transferred directly for morphogenetic studies or dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Scientific, USA) to form monolayer in tissue culture plates and cultured in normal gravitational conditions termed as static shift (SS). The shifted cells were cultured for 4 days prior to cell cycle, apoptosis and gene expression analysis and 7 days for colony forming unit analysis. The Shifted clumps were maintained for two months for observations and expression analysis (prolonged shift). The shifting of SM cells to normal conditions provides a platform to study the effects of stress removal, especially in terms of gene expression.</p>
