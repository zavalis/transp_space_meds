                  <p>Postflight orthostatic intolerance has been regarded as a major adverse effect after microgravity exposure, in which cerebrovascular adaptation plays a critical role. Our previous finding suggested that dedifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) might be one of the key contributors to cerebrovascular adaptation under simulated microgravity. This study was aimed to confirm this concept and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>

                  <p>Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to 28‐day hindlimb‐unloading to simulate microgravity exposure. VSMC dedifferentiation was evaluated by ultrastructural analysis and contractile/synthetic maker detection. The role of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel was revealed by assessing its blocking effects. MiR‐137 was identified as the upstream of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel by luciferase assay and investigated by gain/loss‐of‐function approaches. Calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) pathway, the downstream of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel, was investigated by detecting calcineurin activity and NFAT nuclear translocation.</p>

                  <p>Simulated microgravity induced the dedifferentiation and proliferation in rat cerebral VSMCs. T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel promoted the dedifferentiation and proliferation of VSMC. MiR‐137 and calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway were the upstream and downstream signalling of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel in modulating the dedifferentiation and proliferation of VSMCs, respectively.</p>

              <p>Postflight orthostatic intolerance, associated with high risk to astronaut's health and performance, has been considered as one of the major adverse effects when exposed to microgravity environment, and there are still no effective countermeasures.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> It has been reported that multiple mechanisms are implicated in the occurrence of postflight orthostatic intolerance, including hypovolaemia, alterations in baroreceptor reflex, decreases in exercise tolerance and aerobic fitness, and cardiovascular dysfunction.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Recently, both human studies from spaceflights and head‐down tilt bed tests and animal studies from tail‐suspended hindlimb‐unweighting rat model revealed that functional and structural adaptation in cerebral arteries including the augmented myogenic tone, the enhanced arterial reactivity, increased media thickness and the number of smooth muscle cell layers, could be one of the fundamental causes in the postflight orthostatic intolerance, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>

              <p>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) displays a remarkable plasticity in different phenotypes, which is crucial to maintain vascular function normally.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> The majority of VSMCs are stable in differentiated contractile phenotype in physiological conditions. These differentiated contractile VSMCs could undergo a rapid shift to dedifferentiated synthetic phenotype when exposed to environmental stimuli, which known as dedifferentiation or phenotype switching.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> During the process of dedifferentiation, VSMC lose the contractile ability, but restart the programme of cell growth, synthesis, proliferation, migration and secretion. It has been demonstrated that dedifferentiation of VSMC is characterized by reduced expression of contractile‐specific proteins, such as smooth muscle α‐actin (SM‐α‐actin), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM‐MHC), smoothelin, calponin and smooth muscle protein 22α (SM22α), and increased expression of some early‐response genes, including c‐Fos, osteopontin (OPN) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Dedifferentiation of VSMC is an initial and key incident in series of cardiovascular physiologies and pathologies, such as angiogenesis, pregnancy, injury repair, atherosclerosis, hypertension and artery stenosis.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> We previously observed that simulated microgravity could induce dedifferentiation and proliferation of VSMCs in the basilar arteries of rats, suggesting that it may be one of the key contributors to cerebrovascular adaptation when exposed to microgravity.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>
</p>
              <p>The intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, tightly controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and transporters, is an important messenger in VSMC dedifferentiation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> One of the most important components of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in VSMC is the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage‐dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs). The high‐voltage activated L‐type (large or long‐lasting) and low‐voltage activated T‐type (tiny or transient) Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are the two main types of VDCCs in VSMC.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> L‐type VDCCs has been reported to be significantly increased in differentiated contractile VSMCs and decreased in dedifferentiated synthetic VSMCs and suppressed the dedifferentiation of VSMC.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Our previous study demonstrated that simulated microgravity could upregulate the expression of L‐type VDCCs in dedifferentiated synthetic VSMCs of rat cerebral arteries,<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> suggesting there are other Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal pathways responsible for the dedifferentiation of cerebral VSMCs under simulated microgravity. Recent studies revealed that T‐type VDCCs were increased in dedifferentiated synthetic VSMCs.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> We also found that the expression of T‐type VDCCs were upregulated in dedifferentiated cerebral VSMCs of simulate microgravity rats. However, the role of T‐type VDCCs in modulating the dedifferentiation of VSMC has not been elucidated up to now.</p>
              <p>Vascular smooth muscle cells phenotype which modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is defined by Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent transcription factors, including serum response factor (SRF), cAMP response element‐binding protein (CREBP), nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) and C‐terminus of voltage‐dependent L‐type Ca<sup>2+</sup> calcium channels. Different types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling could activate different Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent transcription factors and thus modulate VSMC dedifferentiation by regulating the expression patterns of contractile or synthetic marker genes.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Moreover, a series of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) have also been identified as the upstream signals of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in VSMC dedifferentiation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Interestingly, our research showed that simulated microgravity upregulated the expression of T‐type VDCCs in a post‐transcriptional way, indicating a potential role for miRNAs in it. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of T‐type VDCCs in VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation under simulated microgravity and its underlying mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Basilar arteries were fixed, dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained with a diamond knife using ultramicrotome (EMUC6/FC6; Leica Microsystems) and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. After that, the sections were viewed and photographically recorded using a scanning TEM (Tecnai G2 F20S‐TWIN; FEI) at 100 kV with a high‐performance Gatan CCD camera. For morphological assessments, individual cerebral VSMCs which reside in the tunica media of the basilar arterial were observed after being magnified 6000 times. Intracellular myofilaments, which support contractile apparatus, and cytoplasmic organelles including endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which support synthetic apparatus, were observed after being magnified 20 000 times.</p>

                <p>Basilar artery segments were dissected along with partial brain, embedded and sectioned. Immunohistochemical staining was then performed following protocols ZSGB‐bio (ZSGB‐bio) recommended. Briefly, sections were incubated with appropriate dilution of the primary antibodies against SM‐MHC (Abcam), SM‐α‐actin (Abcam), SM22α (Proteintech), OPN (Abcam) and PCNA (Abcam), and the secondary IgG antibodies and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐conjugated streptavidin. Finally, 3,3′‐diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as a chromogen to detect with Olympus IX71 inverted microscope. To assess nonspecific staining, sections were incubated in PBS without primary antibody as the negative control. Relative optical density (ROD) was calculated by normalizing integrated optical density (IOD) to vessel wall area. All image analyses were performed using Image Pro Plus 6.0 software.</p>

                <title>Electrophysiological recordings</title>
                <p>Currents were recorded using the whole‐cell patch‐clamp technique in isolated cerebral arteries VSMCs as described previously.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> Command‐voltage protocols and data acquisition were performed with pCLAMP software (version 8.0, Axon Instruments). To account for differences in cell size, currents were normalized to Cm to obtain the current densities. Currents were filtered at 0.5 kHz and digitized at 4 kHz. Ba<sup>2+</sup> replaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier to increase unitary currents and to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent run‐down. To obtain the I–V curve of T‐type VDCCs, the current densities were plotted against the corresponding command potentials. Two kinds of external solutions, solutions A and B, were used. Solution A was used while making a gigaohm seal between the recording pipette and cell surface. It contained (in mmol/L) 130 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>‐5% CO<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.4 titrated with NaOH. After a seal of 2 GΩ was obtained, the perfusion fluid was changed to solution B during current recording. Solution B contained (in mmol/L) 75 Tris‐Cl, 50 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>‐5% CO<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.4 titrated with Tris base. Cs<sup>+</sup> was used in the pipette solution to minimize outward K<sup>+</sup> current. The pipette contained (in mmol/L) 150 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP and 5 Na<sub>2</sub> creatine phosphate, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>‐5% CO<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.2 titrated with CsOH. Nifedipine and mibefradil have been reported to block L‐type and T‐type VDCCs with an IC50 of 0.01 µmol/L and 0.12‐0.14 µmol/L.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> Application of 0.1 μmol/L nifedipine and 5 μmol/L mibefradil was used in this study to identify the properties of L‐ and T‐type VDCC channels.</p>

                <p>As shown in Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A‐B, the protein expressions of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 channel in cerebral arteries did not show significant change between CON and SUS rats.

As shown in Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D, there was a significant difference between the HP =−80 mV and HP =−40 mV recordings, which indicated that T‐type VDCCs currents could be recorded at a more hyperpolarized holding potential, consistent with other reports.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> In the present work, we found that 0.1 μmol/L Nifedipine could block about 70% inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in rat cerebral VSMCs at HP =−80 mV as indicated in Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E. Furthermore, addition of 5 μmol/L Mibefradil could block about 85% inward Nifedipine‐insensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in rat cerebral VSMCs at HP =−80 mV in the presence of 0.1 μmol/L Nifedipine. Therefore, the whole‐cell currents recorded at −80 mV HP in the presence of 0.1 μmol/L Nifedipine were used as the representative T‐type VDCCs currents in our experimental system (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>F). As compared with that of CON rats, the current densities of T‐type VDCCs in cerebral VSMCs of SUS rats were significantly increased.

                <p>During the process of serum‐induced dedifferentiation in cultured A7r5 cells, the mRNA expression of contractile marker (SM‐MHC) significantly decreased, whereas synthetic marker (OPN) markedly increased in a time‐dependent manner (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A, B). Accordingly, the mRNA expression of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 was also continuously increased during this process (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Interestingly, whether silencing T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel by specific siRNA oligonucleotide (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D, F, G) or blocking it by 5 μmol/L mibefradil (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E, F, G) significantly increased expressions of contractile makers (SM‐MHC, SM‐α‐actin, and SM22α), decreased expressions of synthetic makers (OPN and PCNA) and suppressed cell proliferation.

                <p>To investigate the downstream signalling of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel, Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent calcineurin/NFAT was examined in cerebral arteries of rats. As shown in Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, calcineurin phosphatase activity was significantly increased in cerebral arteries of SUS rats as compared with that in CON rats. Considering nuclear translocation is required to activate NFAT‐dependent transcription, cytoplasmic and nuclear NFATc1‐c4 protein were extracted and quantified. Results showed that there was no significant difference about both cytoplasmic and nuclear protein expression of NFATc1 and NFATc4 in cerebral arteries between SUS rats and CON rats (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, C). NFATc2 protein expression in cerebral arteries of SUS rats and CON rats was too low to be detected.

                <p>To investigate the upstream signalling of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel, we have screened eight candidate miRNAs related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling through the prediction of microRNA target software programs, including miRanda (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microrna.org">http://www.microrna.org</ext-link>), miRDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirdb.org">http://www.mirdb.org</ext-link>) and Targetscan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org">http://www.targetscan.org</ext-link>) (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). By RT‐PCR analysis, miR‐137 was found to be the most significantly decreased miRNA among candidate miRNAs in cerebral arteries of SUS rats as compared with that in CON rats (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). More samples were used to further confirm that miR‐137 was significantly downregulated in dedifferentiated cerebral VSMCs of SUS rats in vivo (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C) and in serum‐induced dedifferentiated A7r5 cells in vitro (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>D). As shown in Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E and F, miR‐137 inhibitor activated the nuclear translocation of NFATc3, while miR‐137 mimic inhibited the nuclear translocation of NFATc3, significantly. Moreover, miR‐137 inhibitor markedly decreased the protein expressions of contractile markers (SM‐MHC, SM‐α‐actin, and SM22α), whereas significantly increased the synthetic markers (OPN and PCNA) expressions (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G) and cell proliferation (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>I, J) in cultured A7r5 cells.

              <p>Gravity or microgravity has a profound effect on the mechanical distribution of fluid within the cardiovascular system.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> There is a hydrostatic pressure gradient from the head to feet in human upright posture due to 1 G gravity. When exposed to microgravity, the hydrostatic gradients are lost throughout the vasculature, which induced a cephalad shift in fluid distribution from the lower part of the body towards the upper body.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> It is considered that arterial pressures around the heart level maintain relatively unchanged, but the peripheral vasculature exhibited an increased transmural pressure in the upper body and a decreased transmural pressure in the lower body during the microgravity.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> The cerebral arteries would undergo adjustments due to adaptation to cerebral hypertension, which protects the down‐stream microcirculation in the brain during spaceflight. However, it also contribute to postflight orthostatic intolerance.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> It has been reported that a 28‐day simulated microgravity could induce a functional adaptation including enhanced myogenic tone and vasoconstrictor reactivity in middle cerebral arteries of rats.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> In addition, there was a structural adaptation including thicker wall, narrower lumen and a migration of proliferated VSMCs towards the subendothelial layer in the basilar arteries of simulated microgravity rats.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> Studies demonstrated that elevated transmural pressures or mechanical stretches could act directly on VSMCs and are regarded as one of the crucial factors to activate the VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> For example, spontaneous hypertension induced a partial dedifferentiation from contractile to synthetic phenotype in aortic VSMCs of rats.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> We wonder whether the elevated transmural pressure of cerebral arteries under simulated microgravity could act on cerebral VSMCs and thus induce the dedifferentiation and proliferation of these cells, as a key initial step of microgravity‐induced structural adaptation of cerebral arteries. As indicated by the ultrastructural characteristics (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the decreased expression of contractile markers (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and the increased expression of synthetic markers (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) in vivo, our work clearly confirmed that simulated microgravity could induce dedifferentiation and proliferation of cerebral VSMCs, which supplemented and improved the underlying mechanisms in the development of cerebrovascular adaptation under microgravity environment exposure.</p>
              <p>The mechanisms underlying VSMC dedifferentiation are still not clear and likely to be intricate. Studies revealed that transmural pressures or mechanical stretches could be sensed by the membrane sensor, such as integrins, ion channels, cytoskeleton and G‐proteins, and subsequently activated several intracellular signalling, including Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, miRNAs, RhoA/ROCK, MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt, ROS formation, calcineurin/NFAT, actin polymerization, to modulate VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Our previous study demonstrated that ion‐channel remodelling and elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cerebral VSMCs play a role in microgravity‐induced cerebrovascular adaptation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Studies revealed that both L‐type VDCC and T‐type VDCC channels could be directly activated by increased blood pressure or mechanical stretch and lead to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into VSMCs.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> Interestingly, studies showed that contractile VSMCs are characterized by low resting cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a rapid transient change in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, whereas synthetic VSMCs are characterized by the sustained elevation of basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a long‐lasting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Recent studies demonstrated that T‐type VDCCs played an important role in the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into VSMCs, which suggested that T‐type VDCCs may be responsible for VSMC dedifferentiation. In addition, it has been hypothesized that low arterial pressures (ranging from 40‐80 mm Hg) could activate T‐type VDCCs and then maintain the myogenic tone possibly via a low window‐type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current, at which the VSMC membrane potentials are relatively hyperpolarized and L‐type VDCCs are inactive.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Therefore, T‐type VDCCs are more sensitive to low arterial pressure and are considered as an early‐response element to the increased blood pressure or mechanical stretch. Besides, T‐type VDCCs has been demonstrated to be associated with G1 and S phases of cell cycle, which is the necessary signalling for cell growth, proliferation, division and vascular neointima formation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> For example, it has been reported that T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel promotes the IGF‐I induced‐cell cycle in pulmonary arterial VSMCs through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent mitogenic signalling cascades.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Both Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2 channels are responsible for T‐type VDCC currents in VSMC.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> The present work showed that T‐type VDCCs currents in cerebral VSMCs of simulated microgravity rats were significantly increased, as a result of increasement of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1, not Ca<sub>V</sub>3.2, channels (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Similarly, the expressions of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 continuously increased during the process of VSMC dedifferentiation in vitro (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A‐C). Furthermore, we found that inhibition of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels by siRNA or antagonist (mibefradil) significantly suppressed the dedifferentiation and proliferation of cultured VSMCs (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D‐G). All these results from animal and cell studies clearly indicated that T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel promoted the VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation, which revealed one of the underlying mechanisms in simulated microgravity and general conditions.</p>
              <p>Vascular smooth muscle cells phenotype, which modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling, is defined by Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent transcription factors.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Calcineurin (also called protein phosphatase 2B, PP2B) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin‐activated serine/threonine phosphatase, which is responded to the sustained elevations of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Activation of calcineurin could directly dephosphorylates NFAT transcription factors within the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the dephosphorylated NFAT would translocate to the nucleus and then mediate calcium‐inducible gene expression patterns.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> Therefore, calcineurin participates in the transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus by targeting NFAT transcription factors. The calcineurin/NFAT pathway is considered to be one of the most important Ca<sup>2+</sup>‐dependent signalling in VSMC dedifferentiation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> The present work showed that simulated microgravity not only induced the activation of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel, but also promoted the downstream calcineurin activity (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A). Five members of NFAT family have been identified up to now, NFATc1 (NFATc or NFAT2), NFATc2 (NFATp or NFAT1), NFATc3 (NFAT4 or NFATx), NFATc4 (NFAT3) and NFAT5.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> We found that simulated microgravity only increased nuclear translocation of NFATc3 among NFAT members that expressed in VSMC (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In addition, silencing or blocking of Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 inhibited activity of calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D‐G) and suppressed VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>D‐G). These results suggested that Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 was involved in the VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation by modulating calcineurin/NFATc3 activation.</p>
              <p>MiRNAs are small non‐coding RNAs that negatively regulate mRNA stability or protein translation by binding to the 3′UTR of the target mRNA, which leads to the degradation of target mRNA or inhibition of translation in most cases.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> A series of specific miRNAs, including miR‐21, miR‐26a, miR‐206, miR‐23b, miR‐153/223, miR‐221/222, miR‐144/451 and miR‐143/145, were proved to be highly expressed in VSMCs and regarded as the upstream signalling of VSMC dedifferentiation.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> For example, miR‐145 has been demonstrated to promote VSMC differentiated contractile phenotype by targeting multiple factors, such as myocardin, Kruppel‐like transcription factors 4 and 5, actin dynamics, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase IIδ (CamKIIδ) and angiotensin converting enzyme.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> It has also been reported that miR‐145 could control the expression of L‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel by targeting CamKIIδ and subsequently regulate the stretch‐induced dedifferentiation in smooth muscle cells.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> The present study showed that T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel was subjected to a post‐transcriptional regulation in rat cerebral VSMCs under simulated microgravity (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A‐C), suggesting a potential role for miRNAs in it. However, there is no evidence indicating any miRNA could target T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel. The present work confirmed that the potential Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 related miR‐137, which predicted by bioinformatics, was significantly reduced during the process of VSMC dedifferentiation in vivo and in vitro (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A‐D). Moreover, we identified that miR‐137 could directly bind to 3’UTR of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 and downregulate its expression by using dual‐luciferase report assay and the gain‐ and loss‐of‐function approaches (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A‐D). The studies about miR‐137 showed that it is related to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in neural cells, embryonic stem cells and various human cancer cells.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>, <xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> For example, miR‐137 has been reported to target cell division cycle 42 to decrease proliferation, invasion and G0/G1 cell cycle progression in colorectal cancer cells.<xref rid="cpr12774-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> However, little is known about the role of miR‐137 in cardiovascular disease. In the present work, we found that inhibition of miR‐137 markedly promoted NFATc3 nuclear translocation, cell dedifferentiation and proliferation of cultured VSMCs, whereas the opposite effect was obtained through the overexpression of miR‐137 (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F, H). Finally, we demonstrated that blockage of T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channels by mibefradil could alleviate the dedifferentiation and proliferation of VSMC induced by miR‐137 downregulation (Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E‐G). These results validated that miR‐137/Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 axis was involved in the VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation.</p>
              <p>As summarized in Figure <xref rid="cpr12774-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, we demonstrated that miR‐137 and its target T‐type Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel modulate dedifferentiation and proliferation of cerebral VSMCs in simulated microgravity rats by regulating calcineurin/NFATc3 pathway. This finding provides a novel mechanism of microgravity‐induced cerebrovascular adaptation and contributes to developing novel approaches as effective countermeasures against microgravity exposure. In particular, our study also has implications for VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation in general conditions.</p>

                  <p>Schematic representation of the miR‐137‐Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1‐calcineurin‐NFATc3 signalling pathway in VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation. In this mechanism, miR‐137 is downregulated in cerebral VSMCs under simulated microgravity conditions. As a direct target of miR‐137, Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 is upregulated and the T‐type VDCC currents are enhanced. Due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Ca<sub>V</sub>3.1 channel, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive calcineurin activity is activated, more phosphorylated NFATc3 are dephosphorylated by calcineurin, and then translocate to nucleus to promote VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation</p>
