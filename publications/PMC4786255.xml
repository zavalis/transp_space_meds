              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p><italic>In vitro</italic> ovarian follicle culture systems have been developed and can be used to study the dynamics of oocyte-grannulosa cell interactions, hormone secretions and oocyte maturation [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Culture of preantral follicles on a flat surface of petri dishes has resulted in live birth in mouse [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Culture of early ovarian follicles in alginate beads (three dimensional, 3D) for the duration of follicle development to the antral stage allows maintaining natural follicular 3D structure, which may be important to keep similar gene expression patterns as <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and produce meiotically competent oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A 3D culture makes cells mimic tissue-like structure more effectively than a 2-dimensional culture. Generally, 3D culture methods can be established using scaffolds (such as hydrogel and inert matrix) and scaffold-free solutions (such as hanging drop suspension, rolling vessel or magnetic levitation). Rolling vessels that generate simulated microgravity (s-μ<italic>g</italic>) conditions, such as rotating wall vessel (RWV), has been developed and used for tissue engineering [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The RWV, preventing cells from aggregation through a constant rotation, has been developed by national Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The rotation speed has to be adjusted to the specific weight of the cells/tissue, the medium density, and viscosity. The constantly falling of cells/tissues within the rotating medium in the RWV generates a simulated microgravity for the samples cultured in the vessels.</p>
              <p>3D cell culture systems using simulated microgravity technologies, such as RWV, have provide a scaffold-free approach in tissue engineering. Human endothelial cells formed intima constructs that might be a first step to the generation of fully functional vessels [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, thyroid cells cultured at s-μ<italic>g</italic> condition for several days formed small spherical aggregates, which can be grown to a state to resemble thyroid tissue [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Further, chondrogenesis can be promoted from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in an RWV bioreactor [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, studies also showed that s-μ<italic>g</italic> compromised mouse oocyte maturation by disrupting meiotic spindle organization and inducing cytoplasmic blebbing [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, s-μ<italic>g</italic> elevated the expressions of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and junC N-terminal kinase (JNK), that trigger stress-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, in mouse preimplantation embryos [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, ovarian tissue containing preantral follicles and isolated preantral follicles from 14-day-old mice were used to investigate the effects of s-μ<italic>g</italic> on development of the follicles and growth of the oocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

                <p>14-day-old mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the ovaries were aseptically removed and collected in L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich). For ovarian tissue culture, each ovary was cut into half with approximate 1 mm in thickness. For follicle culture, follicles were mechanically isolated from ovaries using 26 1/2-guage needles (Becton Dickinson, BD) under a stereomicroscope. The preantral follicles included in the study were selected according to the following criteria: 1) round and centrally located oocytes surrounded by 2–3 layers of grannulosa cells, 2) intact basal membrane to which some theca cells were attached, 3) 90–100 μm follicle diameter.</p>

                <title>Encapsulation of follicles</title>
                <p>Alginate hydrogel preparation and follicle encapsulation were performed as described elsewhere with modification [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Briefly, 0.8% (w/v) sodium alginate (Sigma) solution was reconstituted with sterile PBS; then 10 μl of the alginate solution was dropped into the encapsulation solution (140 mM NaCl / 50 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) to create alginate beads; then, single follicles were pipetted into the middle of each alginate bead. After rinsing in culture medium, alginate beads containing a single follicle were cultured in 35×10 mm dishes or in the vessel under simulated microgravity treatment.</p>

                <title><italic>In vitro</italic> culture of ovarian tissue or encapsulated follicles under simulated microgravity treatment</title>
                <p>The culture medium consisted of alpha-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% insulin-selenium-transferrin (Invitrogen), 10 mIU/ml rFSH (Merck Serono), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In the experimental group, to decrease the net gravitational force on the encapsulated follicles or ovarian tissue, a Synthecon rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus for simulating microgravity was used. The RWW microgravity culture system was set up as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, the high-aspect-ratio rotating vessel (HARV) was filled with light paraffin oil (~10 ml, Vitrolfie), then 150 μl of culture medium containing one piece of ovarian tissue or three encapsulated follicles was placed into the oil inside HARV. In control group, alginate beads containing single follicles or ovarian tissue were cultured in 150 μl of culture medium covered with light paraffin oil in 35×10mm dishes (BD). Both culture dishes and RWV apparatus were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.</p>

About 10 follicles were incubated in 150 μl of the combined LIVE/DEAD assay reagents (2 μM calcein AM and 4 μM EthD-1, Thermo-fisher) at room temperature for 45 min. Following incubation, follicles were transferred to a clean microscope slide with 10 μl D-PBS, covered with a coverslip and sealed with clear fingernail polish. The live and dead granulosa cells in follicles were examined under a confocal fluorescence microscope. Follicles with less than 10% dead cells are considered as healthy survived follicles.</p>

Cultured ovarian tissue was fixed after either 2 days or 4 days culture. Individual follicle was fixed inside the alginate bead after 4 days culture. The fixation was performed in Bouin’s solution (Sigma) at room temperature for 24 hours.

                <p>In ovarian tissue sections strained by H&amp;E, healthy preantral follicles containing at least two layers of granulosa cells were counted and follicle density was calculated by dividing the numbers of follicles with the tissue section area. Follicle and oocyte diameter of the freshly isolated and 4-day-cultured follicles were measured. Measurement of the diameters was performed with a caliper in the eyepiece of an inverted microscope. For each measurement, the mean diameter of a follicle or an oocyte was estimated by means of averaging two perpendicular diameters of the subject.</p>

                <p>For immunohistochemistry, ovarian tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm-thickness sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and performed heat mediated antigen retrieval in Citrate buffer for 15 minutes. After blocking the endogenous peroxidase by 3% hydrogen peroxide and unmasking the antigen by 5% goat serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 3 hours at room temperature.

                <p>To study the effects of s-μ<italic>g</italic> on preantral follicle development in vitro, ovarian tissue containing preantral follicles from 14-day-old mice was cultured under conditions of 1 <italic>g</italic> (control) or s-μ<italic>g</italic> conditions. The number of health follicles was counted in the H&amp;E stained sections in two groups after 0, 2, and 4 days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151062.g002">Fig 2</xref>). By day 2 of culture, there were 8.5±0.5 follicles/10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> (n = 6) and 4.5±0.5 follicles/10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> (n = 6) in the control and s-μ<italic>g</italic> groups, respectively.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The development of tools like RWV provides new strategies in the field of tissue engineering [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent research reported that scaffold-free 3D culture under s-μ<italic>g</italic> condition, such as a rotating wall vessel, supported for tissue engineering, such as cartilage regeneration from chondrocytes, artificial vessel constructions from endothelial cells, and aggregated spheroids from thyroid cells [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, it need further experimental verification whether the s-μ<italic>g</italic> condition can effectively promote the tissue development. In our study, the RWV apparatus equipped with HARVs provided a simulate microgravity condition for droplets of 150 μl medium containing one piece of ovarian tissue or three encapsulated follicles in the context of mineral oil at 25 rotations per minutes. The vessel spin around a horizontal axis allowed for permeation of oxygen and carbon dioxide across a membrane in the back, providing efficient oxygenation and very low shear stress [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At the moment, studies analyzing simulated microgravity’s effects on mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development have shown detrimental mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our study indicated that simulated microgravity compromised follicle survival in the cultured ovarian tissue and isolated preantral follicles from 14-day-old mice. Other studies showed that simulated microgravity induced apoptosis in endothelial cells, gastric cells and B lymphoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but not fetal fibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], suggesting that the effects of microgravity on cell injury may be cell type-dependent.</p>
              <p>We examined the expression of GDF-9, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, in the cultured oocytes under the s-μ<italic>g</italic> condition. Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF9), an oocyte secrete factor, regulates the development of the surrounding granulosa cells in ovarian follicles [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. GDF9 is the oocyte-specific gene product of primary and growing follicles in mouse, rat and human ovaries [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GDF9<sup>-/-</sup> female mouse ovarian follicles are arrested at the primary follicle stage, indicating that GDF9 is responsible for primary follicle growth [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the expression of GDF9 had a decreased level <italic>in vitro</italic> than <italic>in vivo</italic> during the preantral stage of folliculogenesis that may correlated with the less quality of oocytes produced <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Our studies showed that simulated microgravity substantially suppressed GDF-9 expression in oocytes compared with that in the control group. We further analysed the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), as an indicator for the development of granulosa cells. PCNA is a protein involved in cell cycle regulation. The expression of PCNA in granulosa cells correlates with the initiation of folliculogenesis, and it appears in the cells only when they begin to grow [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our studies showed that simulated microgravity condition suppressed PCNA expression in the granulosa cells compared with that in the control group. Once the granulosa cells were initiated to divide, the follicle diameter would increase significantly because of the proliferation of granulosa cells at the preantral stage of folliculogenesis. Whiles oocyte growth is a long-term process from preantral stage (~70μm in diameter) to the ovulatory stage (~120 μm in diameter), and had no obvious change at this stage as shown in our studies.</p>
              <p>At ultrastructural level, microgravity caused cytoskeleton and membrane structural changes [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a report, simulated microgravity disturbed spindle organization and induced cytoplasmic blebbing in GV and MI oocytes [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the present study, we found that oocyte microvilli withdrawn from the zona pellucida under the simulated microgravity treatment, which were similarly observed in the GDF-9-deficient follicles [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We also found that simulated microgravity produced large vacuoles in the periphery of the oocytes. Vacuolization is a common cytoplasmic abnormality in oocytes. The appearance of the large vacuoles may be the results of uncontrollable endocytosis or fusion of the vesicles produced by the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Moreover, we found that simulated microgravity treatment leaded to the appearances of numerous lipid droplets and several multiamellar bodies in the oocytes, suggesting that simulated microgravity promoted autophagy in oocytes.</p>
              <p>Weightless condition provides a very special environment for the cells because of its lack of sedimentation for convection. For a long time, it has been clear that microgravity induces alterations in human cells [<xref rid="pone.0151062.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0151062.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the mechanisms are still unknown. Exposing cells to real microgravity is either very expensive or time limit. In vitro experiments using s-μ<italic>g</italic> devices can provide valuable information about modulations in gene expression profiles, signal transduction, and ultra-structures of cellular organelles in different types of cells, including oocytes, induced by altered gravity conditions. Further studies will be needed to investigate the mechanisms that cause the detrimental effects on the cells, such as oocytes, for improving space medicine and developing new treatment strategies.</p>
