                <p>This study demonstrates the effects of simulated microgravity on <italic>E. coli</italic> K 12 MG1655 grown on LB medium supplemented with glycerol. Global gene expression analysis indicated that the expressions of hundred genes were significantly altered in simulated microgravity conditions compared to that of normal gravity conditions. Under these conditions genes coding for adaptation to stress are up regulated (<italic>sufE</italic> and <italic>ssrA</italic>) and simultaneously genes coding for membrane transporters (<italic>ompC, exbB, actP, mgtA, cysW</italic> and <italic>nikB</italic>) and carbohydrate catabolic processes (<italic>ldcC, ptsA, rhaD</italic> and <italic>rhaS</italic>) are down regulated. The enhanced growth in simulated gravity conditions may be because of the adequate supply of energy/reducing equivalents and up regulation of genes involved in DNA replication (<italic>srmB</italic>) and repression of the genes encoding for nucleoside metabolism (<italic>dfp, pyrD</italic> and <italic>spoT</italic>). In addition, <italic>E. coli</italic> cultured in LB medium supplemented with glycerol (so as to protect the cells from freezing temperatures) do not exhibit multiple stress responses that are normally observed when cells are exposed to microgravity in LB medium without glycerol.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Microbes have the ability to sense and respond to environmental changes occurring in their vicinity. This adaptability confers on them the capacity to thrive under various extreme environmental niches including microgravity. When exposed to microgravity cells experience reduced gravity resulting in a relative lack of sedimentation, low shear stress and low turbulence <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These physical effects of microgravity may influence the growth and also induce other physiological changes. Studies have indicated that bacteria exposed to reduced gravity exhibit up regulation of genes involved in starvation response, acid stress, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, biofilm formation, curli biosynthesis and lipid biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Resistance towards antibiotics and increase in virulence was also reported in different bacteria exposed to microgravity <xref rid="pone.0057860-Rosenzweig1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The above effects of microgravity on bacteria are possibly dependent on the specific media used for culturing the bacteria <xref rid="pone.0057860-Baker1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Benoit1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Functional genomic technologies <xref rid="pone.0057860-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains as a model organism have provided insights in to the effects of microgravity at the genome level. Tucker et al., <xref rid="pone.0057860-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> demonstrated that the expression of genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> under microgravity conditions varied depending on whether the culture was grown on minimal medium or rich medium like Luria-Bertani (LB) broth <xref rid="pone.0057860-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Subsequently, Vukanti et al., <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> using DNA microarrays and <italic>E. coli</italic> K 12 identified a number of genes that were significantly altered in expression under microgravity conditions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In two recent studies again in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> it was clearly demonstrated that microgravity induced expression of multiple stress genes depends on the nutritional status and nutrient resources modulate the responses <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Further, in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> microgravity decreased the virulence of the bacteria if LB medium was supplemented with phosphate ions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Taken together all these studies substantiate that media composition influences the changes occurring in gene expression under microgravity condition.</p>
              <p>In this study, a clinostat that mimics microgravity conditions was used to investigate the effects of microgravity on <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 grown in LB medium supplemented with glycerol to monitor the effects on growth and global gene expression. The need for supplementing LB with glycerol was crucial because the incubator in which the bacteria is proposed to be grown at 30°C in space, under microgravity conditions, in a space recovery capsule due to unforeseen reasons may fail and the incubation temperature may decrease to below 0°C. Such unforeseen failures are not very uncommon in space flights. Haga and Saleh <xref rid="pone.0057860-Haga1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> analysed 168 satellites that were launched during 1995 to 2009 and recorded a total of 170 failure events which included 62 minor, 105 major and 3 fatal failure events. Thus, it may be essential to culture the bacterium in the presence of glycerol to protect the cultures from any kind of power failure in the spacecraft resulting in freezing temperatures.</p>
              <p>The present study differs from the earlier studies in that the LB medium used in the present study is supplemented with glycerol. There is a reasonable chance to assume that the response of the bacterium to microgravity may vary with respect to growth and expression of genes. These assumptions are based on the earlier findings that media components influence the growth and expression of genes of bacteria exposed to microgravity <xref rid="pone.0057860-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In addition it would be interesting to see how glycerol supplementation in the medium would help to overcome the nutrient limiting conditions imposed due to a nutrient depletion zone formed when cells are grown under microgravity conditions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Benoit1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The results of the present study is in accordance with earlier studies that had indicated that <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibits enhanced growth rate and that several genes are differentially expressed when exposed to microgravity <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. But, the genes that were differentially regulated were not identical. For instance Vukanti et al., <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> observed that many of the genes that were up regulated were identified as stress-inducible genes and included starvation-inducible genes, genes associated with multiple stress responses, genes involved in biofilm formation, curli biosynthesis and lipid biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. None of these genes were up regulated in the current study implying that the presence of glycerol in both the control and microgravity exposed cultures nullified the up regulation of stress-inducible genes.</p>
              <p>Further, the genes that facilitate the formation of the nutrient depletion zone in cells grown under microgravity conditions such as up regulation of genes coding for nutrient transport and metabolic enzymes and simultaneously down regulation of genes associated with translation apparatus, DNA replication and cell division <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> were not differentially expressed in the presence of glycerol in the medium. Thus implying that glycerol may not favour the formation of a nutrient depletion zone since it could be utilized as a carbon source. In fact the study also indicates that the enhanced growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> under microgravity may be because of adequate supply of energy/reducing equivalents and increase in transcripts for DNA replication.</p>
              <p>This study also for the first time assigns the differentially regulated genes to sixteen different functional pathways such as several metabolic pathways (purine, pyrimidine, carbohydrate, amino acid etc.), ABC transporter systems, two component systems etc., by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). In addition, DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) was used for geneontology annotations and the analysis yielded up regulated genes involved in DNA transcription and regulation of transcription, genes coding for integral membrane proteins, ion binding and DNA binding etc. The 21 down regulated genes were implicated in nitrogen and amine compound biosynthetic process, ion transport, carbohydrate catabolic process and nucleoside metabolic process. DAVID analysis also annotated genes involved in cellular components such as cell wall, cell membrane and organelle membrane and seven hypothetical protein coding genes namely <italic>yfjD, ydcQ, ynfA, ybdJ, yniB, ygaQ</italic> and <italic>hokE</italic> were assigned to various functional processes in response to microgravity conditions in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

                <title>Growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 in a Clinostat</title>
                <p>A three-dimensional (3D) clinostat is an apparatus that nullifies the effect of gravity, and it has been used to evaluate the effects of microgravity on cells <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Gruener1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A 3D clinostat is capable of randomizing motion and thus cancels the uniform gravity influence and as a consequence an object is subjected to weightlessness which is referred commonly as simulated microgravity. The formula for microgravity (g′) is g′ = ω2R/g where g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, R = radius from the centre of rotation, ω = constant angular velocity (ω) where angular velocity is equal to angular displacement in radians/time taken (θ/τ). The angular velocity obtained using the clinostat was 2 rads/s. At this angular velocity, the simulated microgravity is 1×10<sup>−3</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0057860-Huijser1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The microgravity in the present study was 1×10<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
                <p>To 300 ml of LB medium 3.0 ml of logarithmically growing <italic>E. coli</italic> culture (0.8 OD) was added and 15 ml of this inoculum was distributed into 15 ml separate vessels and grown in clinostat at 30°C. Under these conditions the g was 1×10<sup>−3</sup>
<italic>g</italic>. After every one hour interval one vessel was detached from the instrument and OD<sub>600nm</sub> of the culture was determined and used to construct the growth curves. <italic>E. coli</italic> culture that was setup as above and grown in an incubator shaker at 30°C under normal gravity conditions served as control. Data of three experiments that were conducted under similar conditions separately was considered in plotting the growth curves.</p>
                <p>For simulated microgravity studies, 50 ml of the LB broth was inoculated with 500 µl of logarithmically growing <italic>E. coli</italic> culture and grown in a 50 ml vessel in a clinostat at 30°C. A control was set up as above and grown under normal gravity conditions in an incubator shaker at 30°C. Three separate vessels were maintained under each condition. When the OD<sub>600nm</sub> reached 0.8, 10 ml of the culture collected from each of these vessels was suspended in 3 volumes of RNA<italic>later</italic> solution (Ambion Inc., USA) in their respective sample bottles and stored at 4°C. From the stored culture 3 ml was used for the isolation of RNA.</p>

                <p>Qiagen RNeasy mini-prep kit was used for the extraction of RNA from about 3 ml of <italic>E. coli</italic> culture. The culture was pelleted, suspended in 200 µl Tris-lysozymemixture at room temperature for 5 min and then subjected to lysis with 700 µl of lysis buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Lysis was facilitated by vigorous vortexing the suspension of cells for 5 min. Absolute ethanol (500 µl) was added and the mixture was transferred to a mini-spin column placed in a 2 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. At this stage, 10 µl of DNase prepared in 90 µl of buffer was added to the columns and the columns were kept at room temperature for 10 min. The columns were then washed at 13,000 rpm for 30 s with 500 µl of wash buffers RW1 and purified RNA was collected in 20 µl of RNase-free water after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min. Quality of the purified RNA was assessed following gel electrophoresis and the OD 260/280 ratio of the purified RNA ranged from 1.8–2.0. Quantification of the RNA was done using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nano Drop Technologies, USA).</p>

The gene chip consists of approximately 10,000 probe sets for the 20,366 genes of all the four strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>. DNA micro array chips were hybridized with the labelled cDNA using the Affymetrix protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.affymetrix.com">www.affymetrix.com</ext-link>). Microarray slides were then scanned using Affymetrix 428 Array Scanner and GCOS software to obtain images of the chips and further processed to get intensity cell files for the probe sets. The intensity cell files were then imported normalized for background correction and data analysed using Gene Spring 11.5 software. Genes that exhibited ≥1.5 fold increase or decrease (treated versus control) in expression and P≤0.05 were considered as differentially regulated due to microgravity.</p>

A cutoff p value of 0.05 was used for enriched KEGG pathways and geneontology functions by DAVID. Out of 100 genes that were differentially regulated only 57 genes were considered for analysis using KEGG and DAVID. The remaining 43 genes that coded for unknown or intergenic regions were not included in the analysis.</p>

                <title>Assignment of the Differentially Regulated Genes to Functional Pathways by KEGG and DAVID</title>
                <p>Out of 100 genes that were differentially regulated only 57 genes were considered for analysis using KEGG and DAVID. The remaining 43 genes that coded for 2 unknown and 41 Intergenic regions were not included in the analysis. Out of 57 genes that were differentially regulated only 14 down regulated and one up regulated gene could be associated with a particular pathway when analysed by KEGG pathways. Hyperlinks have been provided to these genes. These fifteen genes belonged to sixteen different pathways like metabolic pathways (<italic>cysH, dfp, hisA, hiuH, ldcC, pyrD</italic> and <italic>speB),</italic> the two-component system (<italic>cusF</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic>), purine metabolism (hiuH <italic>and spoT</italic>), microbial metabolism in diverse environments (<italic>cysH,</italic> and <italic>hiuH</italic>), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (<italic>hisA</italic> and <italic>ldcC</italic>), ABC transporters (<italic>cysW</italic> and <italic>nikB</italic>), glycerophospholipid metabolism (<italic>pldB</italic>), phosphotransferase system (<italic>ptsA</italic>), pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis (<italic>dfp</italic>), pyrimidine metabolism (<italic>pyrD</italic>), fructose and mannose metabolism (<italic>rhaD</italic>), pentose and glucuronate interconversion (<italic>rhaD</italic>), arginine and proline metabolism (<italic>speB</italic>), histidine metabolism (<italic>hisA</italic>), lysine degradation (<italic>ldcC</italic>) and sulfur metabolism (<italic>cysH</italic>). The KEGG pathway analysis also indicated that certain genes like <italic>cysH, hisA, hiuH, ldcC, pyrD, speB,</italic> and <italic>rhaD</italic> were associated with more than one pathway.</p>
                <p>DAVID was also used for geneontology annotations and term enrichments for various biological processes, molecular functioning and cellular components. Out of 57 genes that were differentially regulated and analysed by DAVID only 21 down regulated and 9 up regulated genes yielded term enrichments. Hyperlinks have been provided to these genes. The analysis yielded that the 9 upregulated genes were involved in two biological processes namely DNA transcription and regulation of transcription (<italic>ilvY</italic> and <italic>ydcQ</italic>), one cellular component which included a number of genes coding for integral membrane proteins (<italic>hokE, mdtD, ynfA, ybdJ</italic> and <italic>yniB</italic>) and three molecular functioning terms including ion binding (<italic>cusF</italic> and <italic>ygaQ</italic>) and DNA binding (<italic>ilvY</italic> and <italic>ydcQ</italic>). The 21 down regulated genes were implicated in four biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057860-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) such as genes involved in nitrogen and amine compound biosynthetic process (<italic>hisA, speB, aroP, pyrD, livG, mgtA</italic> and <italic>cysH</italic>), ion transport (<italic>exbB, actP, mgtA, ompC, cysW</italic> and <italic>nikB</italic>), carbohydrate catabolic process (<italic>rhaS, ldcC, ptsA</italic> and <italic>rhaD</italic>) and nucleoside metabolic process (<italic>dfp, pyrD, spoT</italic> and <italic>nupC</italic>).

              <p>Bacteria under reduced gravity conditions exhibit a number of distinct physiological changes such as changes in growth characteristics, increase in resistance to acidic, osmotic, and thermal stress <xref rid="pone.0057860-Nickerson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, greater tolerance to ethanol exposure <xref rid="pone.0057860-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, enhanced attachment abilities <xref rid="pone.0057860-Baker3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-McLean1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, increase in virulence, ability to use substrates more effectively <xref rid="pone.0057860-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and have altered gene expression <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Such studies are best done in a spacecraft in orbit. But due to logistic reasons and practical limitations, studies conducted in ground-based systems that mimic microgravity conditions like using a clinostat, could help to generate data and provide clues to important effects of microgravity on life systems <xref rid="pone.0057860-Gao2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0057860-Nickerson2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A clinostat creates microgravity conditions characterized by reduced sedimentation, low shear and low turbulence as in space flight <xref rid="pone.0057860-Nickerson2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Nickerson3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Thus studies have used clinostat as a device to subject microbes to reduced gravity conditions and monitor the effects on the growth, physiology and expression of genes in bacteria <xref rid="pone.0057860-Yamazaki1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Benoit2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Earlier studies demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> under simulated microgravity conditions exhibits decreased lag phase and an increase in exponential phase compared to normal gravity <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Baker4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Klaus1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Our study on growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> on LB medium in a clinostat also showed increased growth rate compared to normal gravity conditions. On the contrary Bouloc and D’Ari <xref rid="pone.0057860-Bouloc1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> showed no difference in growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the orbiting Biocosmos 2044 satellite compared to its ground based controls. Studies have indicated that the effects of reduced gravity on bacterial viability and growth is dependent on whether the bacteria were cultured in rich or dilute media. In <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth characteristics were similar in LB under reduced and normal gravity conditions but in 1/10 LB, the growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> was significantly increased under microgravity <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti3" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The authors have also suggested that the physiological responses to microgravity conditions vary with growth medium and growth phase. However, recent studies by Berry et al <xref rid="pone.0057860-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> on the effect of hypobaric pressures similar to those of the surface of mars (0.69 kPa global average) on the growth of <italic>E.coli</italic> revealed slight reduction in growth.</p>
              <p>In the present study a fold change of ≥1.5 was considered to analyse the data on differential gene expression in simulated microgravity conditions. Several other studies also used a fold change ≥1.5 as a cut-off for the analysis of differential gene expression <xref rid="pone.0057860-Yuan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Dalman1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In this study using a fold change ≥1.5 cut-off a total of 100 genes were differentially regulated in <italic>E. coli</italic> under simulated microgravity conditions, out of which fifty three were upregulated and forty seven down regulated compared to normal gravity grown culture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057860-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057860-t003">3</xref>).</p>
              <p>Wilson et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> were the first to monitor global gene expression in <italic>Salmonella</italic> in response to microgravity. A total of 163 genes were differentially regulated by microgravity. These differentially regulated genes included genes coding for transcriptional regulators, virulence factors, lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic enzymes, iron-utilization enzymes and several genes with no homology to other genes in the current databases. Subsequent studies on <italic>Salmonella</italic> also led to the discovery of novel virulence mechanisms involving a ferric uptake regulator under reduced gravity conditions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Recent studies also revealed that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator <xref rid="pone.0057860-Crabbe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Vukanti et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> using <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 demonstrated that 430 genes were significantly altered in expression under modeled reduced gravity conditions. Up regulated genes included starvation inducible genes (<italic>csiD, cspD, ygaF, gabDTP, ygiG, fliY</italic> and <italic>cysK</italic>), genes associated with multiple stress responses (<italic>asr, yhiW, yehZYW, katE</italic> and <italic>btuDE</italic>), genes involved in biofilm formation (<italic>lldR, lamB, yneA, fadB</italic> and <italic>ydeY</italic>), curli biosynthesis (<italic>csgDEF</italic>), and lipid biosynthesis (<italic>yfbEFG</italic>). None of these genes were up regulated in the current study. The only difference between the present study and that of Vukanti et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> being that <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 in the present study was grown in LB containing glycerol. Therefore the effect of glycerol on gene expression was studied (GEO accession number is GSE34275). It was observed that in <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655 grown in the presence of glycerol 103 genes were up regulated whereas 209 were down regulated (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057860.s001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057860.s002">S2</xref>). The results also indicated that the presence of glycerol in both the control and microgravity exposed cultures nullified the up regulation of starvation induced genes (<italic>cbp</italic>A, <italic>usp</italic>B <italic>and wrb</italic>A), genes associated with multiple stress responses (<italic>hdeA, hdeB, hdeD, gadA, gadB, gadC, gadW, cadB, dhaL, dhaK, ompW, tar</italic> and <italic>tnaL</italic>), genes involved in curli biosynthesis (<italic>fliC, fimA</italic>), and lipid biosynthesis (<italic>ybjP</italic>) as observed by Vukanti et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The mechanism or the reason for the difference observed still remains unknown. A few of the differentially regulated genes were also validated for their expression by RT-PCR and found to be consistent with the DNA microarray results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057860-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0057860-t003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057860-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
              <p>Earlier studies demonstrated that cells grown under microgravity conditions develop a nutrient depletion zone around the cells <xref rid="pone.0057860-Hammond1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. As a consequence, genes coding for nutrient transport and salvage systems, multiple stress resistance and metabolic enzymes are up regulated and simultaneously down regulation of genes associated with translation apparatus, DNA replication and cell division were observed <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, surprisingly in the present study the above genes were not differentially expressed implying that the presence of glycerol in the medium may not favour the formation of a nutrient depletion zone. In fact this may be so because glycerol can enter the cell through simple diffusion and thus get utilized as a carbon source and generate acidic metabolic products. This may be the reason as to why <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in the presence of glycerol exhibits up regulation of genes related to acid stress (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057860.s001">Table S1a</xref>nd <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0057860.s002">S2</xref>). Recently, Vukanti and Leff <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> also demonstrated that general stress response of the bacteria grown under microgravity can be reversed by supplementing a nutrient rich medium.</p>
              <p>Comparison of genes identified in the present study to genes reported in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> revealed that only a few differentially expressed genes were common. These genes include <italic>hyaE, livG</italic> and <italic>pyrD</italic>. Gene <italic>hyaE</italic> encodes for HyaE protein of hydrogenase-1 operon which comprises six genes <italic>hyaABCDEF</italic>. In Vukanti et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> all the six genes of the operon were up regulated whereas in the present study only <italic>hyaE</italic> was upregulated. <italic>pyrD</italic> which encodes dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis is down regulated in both the studies. In addition, in the paper of Vukanti et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> few other genes of the <italic>pyr</italic> operon (<italic>pyrF, carA, pyrB, pyrG, pyrC</italic> and <italic>carB</italic>) were also down regulated. Gene <italic>livG</italic> that belongs to <italic>livFGHMK</italic> operon that is involved in high-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system is down regulated. While <italic>ilvGMEDA</italic> operon an amino acid biosynthetic operon required for the synthesis of the branched chain aminoacids isoleucine, leucine and valine is down regulated in previous studies <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In the present study <italic>cysW</italic> involved in sulfate/thiosulfate transport, <italic>cysH</italic> involved in cystein biosysnthesis and gene <italic>actP</italic> that is involved in acetate transport are down regulated, so as to possibly maintain pH homeostasis in the acidified media conditions. This is in contrast to the previous observations that genes pertaining to acetate metabolism <italic>acs</italic> and <italic>actP</italic> and <italic>cysAV</italic> involved in sulfate/thiosulfate transport as well as genes involved in cysteine biosynthesis <italic>cysCDIJKN</italic> were upregulated <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, to overcome oxidative stress due to microgravity conditions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In the present study 100 genes were either up or down regulated when <italic>E. coli</italic> was cultured under microgravity conditions. Analysis based on the DAVID geneontology (GO) term enrichments included the following up regulated genes belonging to DNA transcription (<italic>srmB</italic>) and those involved in regulation of transcription (<italic>ilVY</italic> and <italic>ydcQ</italic>). Gene <italic>srmB</italic> encodes for DNA helicase. Upregulation of helicases is interesting as these plays a vital role in DNA repair, recombination and RNA transcription <xref rid="pone.0057860-Jagessar1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. At the same time DAVID analysis also revealed enrichment of GO terms such as nucleoside metabolic process for the down regulated genes <italic>dfp, pyrD, spoT.</italic> Gene <italic>dfp</italic> is an essential gene required for DNA synthesis <xref rid="pone.0057860-Spitzer1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and gene <italic>pyrD</italic> involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0057860-Wilson5" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> are down regulated. Gene <italic>ydcR</italic> that belongs to one of the transcriptional regulator family GntR is also repressed. The low abundance of these genes may be because of the active growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> culture under microgravity conditions. The <italic>spoT</italic> gene which codes for ppGpp in response to nutrients limitation <xref rid="pone.0057860-Mittenhuber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057860-Mechold1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> is also repressed implying that cells are not in a nutrients limiting condition in the clinostat. Based on DAVID analysis, genes involved in carbohydrate catabolic process (<italic>rhaS, rhaD, ldcC</italic> and <italic>ptsA</italic>) are also down regulated suggesting that energy/reducing equivalents are adequately present. Gene <italic>ilvY</italic> is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>ilvA</italic> gene of the <italic>ilvGMEDA</italic> operon encoding for biosynthesis of branched chain aminoacids leucine, isoleucine and valine <xref rid="pone.0057860-Parekh1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> is up regulated. It is also observed that DAVID analysis enriched GO terms nitrogen compound and amine biosynthetic processes for down regulated <italic>genes hisA, speB, aroP, pyrD, livG, mgtG</italic> and <italic>cysH</italic>. These results imply that cells growing under microgravity conditions are not deprived of nitrogenous compounds.</p>
              <p>The other up regulated genes enriched include those coding for cation-binding (<italic>cusF</italic> and <italic>ygaQ</italic>) and DNA-binding (<italic>ydcQ)</italic>. Tucker et al., <xref rid="pone.0057860-Vukanti1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> reported down regulation of <italic>cusF</italic> when <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in MOPS medium under simulated microgravity conditions. <italic>cusF</italic> is a periplasmic chaperone and exports copper and silver ions both from cytoplasm and periplasm to the external environment to maintain cell homeostasis. Enrichment of DAVID GO terms for ion transport, metal ion transport and cation transport for the down regulated genes (<italic>ompC, exbB, actP, mgtA, cysW</italic> and <italic>nikB</italic>) is also indicated. These transport systems assist in uptake of essential nutrients, regulate the flow of physiologically relevant chemicals, and release substances such as signalling molecules. Gene <italic>ompC</italic> coding for major outer membrane protein functions as a porin, allows free diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules across the membrane <xref rid="pone.0057860-Ikenaka1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> is down regulated. Apart from these ion transporters, detoxification genes like <italic>gst</italic> encoding for glutathione transferase that protects cells by detoxification of metals Hg<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>
<xref rid="pone.0057860-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> is also down regulated may be because the cells are in an environment free of metal ions.</p>
              <p>Based on DAVID enrichment terms the up regulation of genes integral to membrane include <italic>mdtD</italic> along with hypothetical protein coding genes <italic>hokE, ynfA, ybdJ</italic> and <italic>yniB</italic>. Gene <italic>mdtD</italic> that encodes for multidrug efflux system <xref rid="pone.0057860-Nagakub1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> may indicate acquisition of drug resistance by <italic>E. coli</italic> cultured under microgravity conditions. This observation is in accordance with the observations of Leys et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Leys1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref> that bacteria growing in space require greater concentrations of various antibiotics to inhibit their growth. However, Tucker et al. <xref rid="pone.0057860-Tucker1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> did not observe any significant change in the antibiotic resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> exposed to microgravity. The up regulation of <italic>sufE</italic> implies that in the prevailing conditions iron was limiting since <italic>suf</italic> genes are induced under iron limitation conditions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Nachin1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Up regulation of gene <italic>ssrA</italic> that encodes for small RNA, is required for adaptation to environmental changes and growth under stress conditions <xref rid="pone.0057860-Ranquet1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> could be an advantage to the growth of the bacterium under microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>On the whole in this study a number of genes that were not reported earlier when <italic>E. coli</italic> is grown on LB media under microgravity conditions appeared when 10% v/v glycerol is additionally supplemented to LB medium. The up regulated genes comprised those that are related to transcription and integral to membrane. Among the down regulated genes, those involved in nitrogen, nucleoside and carbohydrate metabolic process and membrane related transporters were present. We did not observe elevation of multiple stress genes in response to nutrient depletion zone in our study, may be because of the reversal of this stress with glycerol in the medium. Using DAVID seven hypothetical protein coding genes namely <italic>yfjD, ydcQ, ynfA, ybdJ, yniB, ygaQ</italic> and <italic>hokE</italic> were assigned to various functional processes in response to microgravity conditions in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A number of hypothetical and Intergenic region genes were also differentially expressed.</p>

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>The results imply that <italic>E. coli</italic> in the presence of glycerol under simulated microgravity conditions grows better than compared to the normal gravity control. The enhanced growth may be because of adequate supply of energy/reducing equivalents and increase in transcripts for DNA replication. Further, glycerol supplementation in the medium helps in overcoming multiple stressors exerted in microgravity conditions due to nutrient limitations.</p>
