              <abstract>
                <p>This study focused on the effects of simulated microgravity (s-μg) on
mechanical properties, major cytoskeleton biopolymers, and morphology of endothelial
cells (ECs). The structural and functional integrity of ECs are vital to regulate
vascular homeostasis and prevent atherosclerosis. Furthermore, these highly gravity
sensitive cells play a key role in pathogenesis of many diseases. In this research,
impacts of s-μg on mechanical behavior of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells were investigated by utilizing a three-dimensional random
positioning machine (3D-RPM). Results revealed a considerable drop in cell stiffness
and viscosity after 24 hrs of being subjected to weightlessness.
Cortical rigidity experienced relatively immediate and significant decline comparing
to the stiffness of whole cell body. The cells became rounded in morphology while
western blot analysis showed reduction of the main cytoskeletal components.
Moreover, fluorescence staining confirmed disorganization of both actin filaments
and microtubules (MTs). The results were compared statistically among test and
control groups and it was concluded that s-μg led to a significant
alteration in mechanical behavior of ECs due to remodeling of cell cytoskeleton.</p>

            <p>Microgravity condition leads to endothelium dysfunction which in turn causes the
individuals to experience cardiovascular deconditioning as well as physiologic
changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Gravitational alterations influence endothelial cell (EC)
proliferation, differentiation, signaling, gene expression, surface adhesion molecules,
extracellular matrix proteins expression, and cause significant changes in cytoskeletal
polymers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
            <p>Endothelium plays a crucial role in local blood flow, regulation of coagulation,
permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and vascular smooth muscle cell growth. The structural
and functional integrity of the ECs are vital to regulate vascular homeostasis and
prevent atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Chemical regulators, extracellular matrix,
and environmental conditions adjust the cells’ functions. Mechanical
loadings such as shear stresses resulted from blood flow, hydrostatic pressure, and
cyclic stretch are some examples of environmental stimuli able to alter the
functionality and mechanical properties of ECs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. In addition to
regulatory effects of such stresses, in critical conditions, the extreme values may
initiate pathologic problems such as atherosclerosis and intima hyperplasia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. DNA microarray analysis revealed that about 600 genes (3% of all genes)
of ECs responded to shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. On the other hand, altered mechanical
properties of cells may contribute to cell remodeling and regulation of stresses within
the cell body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Actin filaments align to the direction of shear stress,
which consequently lead the cells spindle-shaped. Cells experiencing turbulent flow
found a rounder shape with non-uniform orientations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p>
            <p>It has been demonstrated that mechanical unloading (MU) remodeled actin cytoskeleton
polymer, reduced the total amount of this biopolymer through transcriptional
mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, and had a significant effect on the arrangement and
dynamics of microtubules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The detailed mechanisms involved in
conversion of MU to intracellular biochemical reactions are still elusive. Therefore,
<italic>in vitro</italic> studying of the endothelial behavior in response to microgravity
conditions in term of mechanical properties assists in understanding of endothelium
alterations, mechanisms involved in vascular problems, and pathogenesis of related
diseases in space mission. Several studies have been done to evaluate the mechanical
properties of cells exposed to a variety of mechanical stresses by using either
quantitative and qualitative techniques<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Micropipette aspiration (MA)
is the most feasible method, which enables measurement of the whole cell mechanical
properties. It eliminates disadvantageous effects of cell-matrix interaction and more
importantly the stiffness of substrate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>.</p>
            <p>The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of s-μg on viscoelastic
parameters of ECs and the content of main cytoskeleton polymers. A developed RPM was
utilized to simulate weightless conditions by means of continuous random change of
orientation, relative to the gravity vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Concerning difficulties with space experiments, RPM is an appropriate
candidate for ground-based evaluations with a reliable performance comparing to real
microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In this report, primary ECs were placed under
s-μg conditions by which viscoelastic properties, proliferation, morphology,
and cytoskeleton content were investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
the very first study on the effects of microgravity on the cell mechanical properties
and the linkage with the main cytoskeletal polymers contents.</p>

                <p>All ECs had typical viscoelastic solid creep behavior responding to a 600 Pa step

a real image of MA experiment for an endothelial cell after 72 hrs

                <p>Western Blot (WB) analysis was performed to estimate the content of F-actins and
MTs in ECs. The results helped to quantify the alterations of two main
cytoskeletal biopolymers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> shows the densitometric
quantization of the relative band intensities for cells under 24 hrs

expression of both cytoskeleton filaments is reduced. The content of F-actins
protein reduced around 65% and the reduction for β-tubulin
expression was 26% under the microgravity simulation. Similarly, fluorescent
staining revealed a considerable disruption in structural filamentous polymers.
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref> shows the MTs and the actin filaments of the
cells for control and s-μg condition. The images show that the more
cell being under simulated microgravity, the more the cytoskeleton disrupts. The
actin rim underneath the plasma membrane was no more continuous. Microtubules
network obviously disorganized and relatively concentrated around the

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Mechanical properties of EC provide the cell ability to resist widespread hemodynamic
forces and at the same time, to respond differentially to variations in different
surrounding stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. ECs constantly experience shear stress,
cyclic stretch, and hydrostatic pressure. The developed mechanical stresses within
the cell body have shown an evident role in the endothelium function. Furthermore,
altered mechanical properties of cells by microenvironmental loadings have
influenced cell remodeling and regulation of the stresses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Vascular
endothelium dysfunction undoubtedly influences vascular smooth muscle proliferation,
angiogenesis, and wound healing. It is generally believed that the endothelial
mechanical properties, gravisensation, and gravitropism are mostly defined by the
cytoskeleton. The adaptation of cell mechanical tension to any changes in external
mechanical stresses depends on the cell mechanical characteristics and the
sensitivity of mechanosensors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Similar to other eukaryotic cells,
the endothelial cytoskeleton strongly depend on three major entangled filamentous
biopolymers: actin filaments, microtubules, and to a less extent intermediate
filaments. This highly dynamic network defines cell shape, withstand external
forces, and effectively respond to mechanical stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Actin
filaments, besides structural responsibility, play key functions in cell morphology,
migration, phagocytosis, vesicular movement, cytokinesis, and molecular transport
between the plasma membrane and the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Cell locomotion is
mediated by actin networks in cell cortex. While F-actins resist against
deformations, they fluidize under high shear stresses. They respond to external
forces and they have substantial effect in formation of leading-edge protrusions
during cell motility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Therefore, any disorganization of actin
filaments may interfere with the transmission of forces across the cell
membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Microtubules are essential skeletal elements in cell
division, polarization, and migration. Microtubules as the second major constituent
of the cytoskeleton act in concert with the other filament biopolymers to stabilize
the cell structure under compression loadings. According to the tensegrity theory,
MTs as load-bearing compression elements and actin filaments as tension elements
support integrity of cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. ECs showed sensitivity to short term
microgravity (22 s) in rearrangement of their β-tubulin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Moreover, being subjected to s-μg more than
96 hrs caused a decrease in the total amount of actin as well as
disorganization of actin cytoskeleton which could lead to apoptosis. In one word,
the responses of cells to microgravity are cell-type and exposure-time
dependent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p>
              <p>In this study, we demonstrated that microgravity could change mechanical properties,
content of the main cytoskeleton polymers, and morphology of ECs. Previous studies
confirmed viscoelastic behavior of ECs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. While deformation of
cell body is mostly determined by elasticity, viscoelasticity characterizes time
dependent alteration in deformation. Viscoelastic parameters of ECs were evaluated
quantitatively by MA technique over 72 hrs. Young’s modulus
and viscosity of the ECs decreased during microgravity experiments. As described by
results of the current study, microgravity caused a significant increase in
deformability of the cultured ECs. This effect was intensified by s-μg
exposure time. Although mechanical parameters of ECs did not experience
statistically meaningful reduction at 12 hrs,
<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>μ</italic> decreased substantially
about 20% (p &lt; 0.01) and 40%
(p &lt; 0.001) at 24 hrs and it continued
reduction until 72 hrs. As the viscoelastic properties of the cells
showed significant alterations at 24 hrs, this time point was selected
to compare the cytoskeleton reorganization with control cells. Accordingly, MTT
assay, western blotting were performed at that time point. There are a few studies
that addressed a short period viability for ECs under microgravity and any possible
consequences on the cell structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. MTT assay was performed to
make sure the least side effect of s-μg on cell survival at the time of
cytoskeleton evaluation. Viability assay depicted a trivial effect of microgravity
on ECs proliferation at 24 hrs. Subsequently, WB analysis and
fluorescence staining were done at this time point. Although trypsin used for cell
detachment may affect the cytoskeleton, the observed changes in mechanical
properties are mainly generated by s-μg. All mechanically investigated
cells were treated in similar conditions with similar detaching approach and MA.
Trypsin’s concentration, volume, exposing time were maintained similar
in all experiments, thereby the differences in mechanical properties were mostly
associated with the microgravity exposure time. Disruption of stress and tensile
fibers and orientation of filamentous bundles can be influential in both elastic and
viscous parameters of cellular mechanical model. Although polymerization and
depolymerization of the main cytoskeletal fibers are much faster comparing to
continuous random change of orientation by RPM, it is shown in line with other
reports that the total amount of actin filaments and microtubules decreased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Western blot analysis, which was performed very
immediately after simulated microgravity, confirmed a considerable reduction in
content of both actin filaments and microtubules. Obviously, actin filaments were
more susceptible to unloading by experiencing a dramatic drop of 65% comparing to
26% reduction in microtubules. It is believed that a drop in actin filaments is an
adaptive mechanism to avoid the accumulation of redundant actin fibers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. This phenomena is likely due to transcriptional regulation of the cytoskeletal
polymers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, where the down-regulation can lead to a
lasting reduction in the synthesis of the cytoskeletal polymers. Cytoskeleton
staining revealed disorganization of both actin filaments and microtubules. The more
cells being under microgravity the more the cytoskeleton disrupts. Cell staining
requires fixation using materials such as paraformaldehyde which helps to preserve
cellular architecture and composition of cells. As the staining procedure started
vey immediately after each s-μg experiment, the visualized cytoskeleton
of the cells obviously proved the disorganization of actin filaments and
microtubules caused by simulated microgravity. The amount of actin filaments
particularly around the membrane was reduced but the reduction for microtubules was
less considerable. In fact, the altered mechanical characteristics of ECs can be
mostly attributed to the rearrangement and reduction in the content of cytoskeletal
actin filaments. There was some time interval between sample dismounting and
cells’ preparation for MA which might affect cytoskeleton structure
however, it could not have a substantial contribution in alteration of mechanical
properties among samples. The evaluated ECs were treated carefully in a same manner
therefore, the differences between viscoelastic properties of the cells are stemmed
from the effects of s-μg. More importantly, the values emphasized in
this research are the differences in mechanical properties rather than absolute
values. This means that even if there are some effects of delays or trypsin on
cytoskeletal properties, we are still able to observe the effect of simulated
microgravity on mechanical properties and cytoskeleton of cells, although this
effect may not be linearly associated.</p>
              <p>Shear stresses are transmitted to the cortical actin rim immediately underneath the
plasma membrane of EC. Actin polymers form a cortical rim in quiescent ECs which
provides a link between extracellular events and intercellular organelles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Densely polymerized array of actin filaments underneath of membrane
has the major role to reinforce membrane against intense cortical deformation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. The rigidity of the cortex as a fundamental property is vital in
regulation of cell shape, cytokinesis, proliferation, differentiation, and the
response to a change in external environment. In addition, formation of protrusive
organelles such as filopodia, lamellipodia, and microvilli is regulated by very
local changes in membrane rigidity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Disruption of actin bundles
suggested evaluating mechanical behaviors of EC cortex. MA experiment begins with
the investigation of cell cortex and its mechanical properties can be estimated by
the instantaneous Young modulus (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>). This parameter
decreased approximately 20% at 12 hrs and reached 67% of its initial
value at 24 hrs. On the other hand, E lessened insignificantly 5% at
12 hrs and the reduction was approximately 20% at 24 hrs of
being in s-μg condition. At 48 hrs, the reduction of both
E<sub>0</sub> and E were similar and around 50% of their initial values. Finally
at 72 hrs, reduction of Young’s modulus exceed instantaneous
Young’s modulus. Indeed, E and E<sub>0</sub> decreased approximately 75%
and 60%, respectively, at 72 hrs. In other words, cell membrane
stiffness was more susceptible to disruption than whole cell body stiffness at early
hours of experiencing microgravity condition, whereas long term s-μg had
more influence on whole cell rigidity than cortical rigidity. It is evident that
disruption of cortical actin boosts endothelial permeability and stops barrier
function of the cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Fluorescence staining suggested that the
mechanical alterations of the cortical actin rim occurred because of extensive
disruption of actin filaments. This has a significant impact on endothelial
dysfunction and vascular damage.</p>
              <p>Microgravity had effects on both cell shape and cytoskeleton. Image processing
algorithms showed that ECs roundness increased under s-μg significantly.
The length and width of the cells decreased in a manner that the circularity of the
cells raised. This morphological alteration was a consequence of cytoskeletal
reorganization at the subcellular level. The circularity parameter increased about 3
times after 24 hrs of s-μg, which is consistent with
previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. The imbalance of forces on a cell seemingly
caused an extracellular matrix remodeling and consequently changes in
morphology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. It is believed that cell rounding and,
consequently, barrier integrity is mainly determined by the actin filaments
organization. It was suggested that a reduction in cell-matrix attachment comparing
to cytoskeletal arrangement and susceptibility of PKC-mediated signal transduction
to microgravity caused the cells to be rounded in shape and not in spread<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.</p>
              <p>In conclusions, it is clearly demonstrated that there is a close relationship between
mechanical properties, the main cytoskeletal polymer contents, and endothelial cell
shape. The findings of this paper indicate an adaptive response of ECs to
microgravity conditions through an alteration in cytoskeleton structure.
Microgravity disrupts the polymerization and depolymerization processes of the main
cytoskeleton polymers and consequently causes improper function by reducing
cytoskeleton-generated tensions. Although s-μg and its effect on
mechanical properties of ECs have been studied, the related mechanotransduction
should be fully understood by further studies. These changes certainly have a direct
influence on signal transduction, synthesis and secretion of cytokines, and gene
expression, which can ultimately lead to apoptosis. Hence, an exact evaluation of
the proteome and utilizing the gene array techniques may expand knowledge about the
involved signaling pathways in endothelial dysfunction and mechanism involved in
vascular disorders in microgravity conditions. This may eventually help to find
novel approaches to prevent vascular disorders. Possibility of creating 3D
differentiated tissue assemblies has attracted several researchers to culture cells
in microgravity conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Accordingly, alterations of the
mechanical features under s-μg need to be known. In addition, the
results from s-μg conditions on mechanical behaviors of ECs should be
compared with real microgravity experience in space.</p>

                <p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from a commercial

(5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% air) in Ham’s
F12 + DMEM (1/1V), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). ECs were cultured on
standard 35-mm diameter petri dishes at a density of
2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per dish.
The fresh medium was replaced every other day. The ECs were used up to passage
5. To detach cells, 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen) was used. To
investigate the effect of microgravity, each petri dish with subconfluent ECs
was mounted on a specific holder to insure nonexistence of any bubbles which
possibly exert undesired shear on the cells. Total of 36 experiments were
performed. Each experiment contains two independent samples; the test sample was
under s-μg whereas the control one was maintained in the same cell
culture incubator. A detail statistical analysis was performed and
P &lt; 0.05 was considered as a maximum to represent
a statistically significant difference. ImageJ software was used to calculate
the amount of circularity for the cells.</p>

contact on mechanical properties of cells, non-confluent dishes were chosen for
MA analysis. The cavity between petri dish and holder were completely filled
with cell culture medium. Thereafter, a 22 μm filter was
inserted in the cap to enable air/medium exchange and to maintain 5%
CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, the samples were mounted as close as possible to
the center of the RPM which was initially located within the incubator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). The RPM functional parameters, random angular walk
speed and the maximum distance of ECs to the center of rotation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, were adjusted to be 0.3–0.7 rad/s and 2 mm
respectively. Before suspending the cells, ECs beyond the maximum distance were
mechanically detached by cell scraper. This approach guaranteed the evaluated
ECs to experience 10<sup>−4 </sup>g as the maximum
gravitational acceleration and
5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> as
the maximum tangential acceleration. The detailed calculation of the developed
microgravity together with the data obained from a 3D acceleration sensor
embedded in the test plate confirmed that the samples experience a gravity of
less than 10<sup>−4 </sup>g.</p>

                <p>In brief, cells were suspended in the culture medium by 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA in
less than 4 min to minimize the effect of trypsinization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Furthermore, the measurement time for all samples was limited
to less than 400 s to minimize the possible cytoskeletal
reorganization after demounting from RPM machine. A movable water reservoir was
implemented to apply the desired pressure at the end of the glass micropipette.
Displacing the reservoir up or down leads to a suitable pressure to pull in or
force away the cell, respectively. This is also applicable to find zero
pressure. Actual pressure was related to the displacement of the reservoir
provided by a precise motor. The step constant negative pressure imposed to each
cell maintained to be between 500–600 Pa in all experiments.
Micropipettes, with internal diameters within the range of
4.5–5 μm were coated with Sigmacote chemical
agent (Sigma) to minimize the possible adhesion of the cells to the inner wall
of the micropipettes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. The cell surface was aspirated into the
pipette by exerting a controlled suction pressure on the cell body at room
temperature around 20–22 °C. An inverted
microscope equipped with a digital camera (Nikon Eclipse, DXM1200) provided
monitoring of the leading edge of cell surface. Each micropipette was under
control by a micromanipulator (Transfer Man Nk2, Eppendorf). At least three
