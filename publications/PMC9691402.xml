              <abstract>
                <p>Vascular remodeling during microgravity exposure results in postflight cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic intolerance in astronauts. To clarify the underlying mechanism, we investigated whether estrogen receptor <italic>α</italic> (ERα)-NRF1-OMI-mitophagy signaling was involved in the dedifferentiation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) under simulated microgravity. Phenotypic markers, mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in rat thoracic artery smooth muscle cells were examined. Four-week hindlimb unweighting (HU) was used to simulate microgravity in rats and 10% serum was used to induce VSMCs dedifferentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. The effects of ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling on mitophagy, phenotypic switching and proliferation of VSMCs, and cerebrovascular remodeling in HU rats were studied by genetic manipulation and chronic drug intervention. We found that ERα is positively associated with contractile phenotype switching but inversely correlated with synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. During the dedifferentiation process of VSMCs, reduced mtDNA copy number, disturbed mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, and perturbed fission-fusion-mitophagy signaling were detected, which were reversed by ERα overexpression. Mechanistically, the ERα downstream protein OMI preserved the mitochondrial Parkin level by increasing its protein stability, thereby protecting mitophagy. In line with this, we found that activating ERα signaling by propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) could alleviate the synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of HU rat cerebral VSMCs by reestablishing fission-fusion-mitophagy hemostasis. The current study clarified a novel mechanism by which inhibited ERα-NRF1-OMI-mitophagy signaling resulted in synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs and cerebrovascular remodeling under simulated microgravity.</p>

              <p>Exposure to microgravity during spaceflight results in postflight cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic intolerance among astronauts when they return to the earth. Regarding the mechanism, spaceflight is known to impose changes on human vasculature with unknown molecular etiologies. Despite remarkable progress in recent decades, the underlying mechanism remains unelucidated.</p>
              <p>Both spaceflight and ground-based studies have revealed adaptive changes in the cardiovascular system under microgravity (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Hargens, 2018</xref>). Accumulating evidence confirms the region-specific structural and functional changes in arteries and microvasculature of different vascular beds during microgravity exposure (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zhang, 2013</xref>). Mechanistically, the activation of the renin-angiotensin system and mitochondrial oxidative stress have been implicated in this process (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>). We found that mitochondrial oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress contributed to the phenotypic transition of cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through the PERK-eIF2a-ATF4-CHOP pathway in hindlimb unweighting (HU) rats (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction results in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded mitochondrial proteins, which triggers the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Melber and Haynes, 2018</xref>). The UPR<sup>mt</sup> involves the activation of CHOP, estrogen receptor <italic>α</italic> (ERα) and SIRT3 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Papa and Germain, 2014</xref>). ERα plays critical roles in regulating mitochondrial function, including bioenergetics, dynamics, and mitophagy (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Klinge, 2020</xref>). Estrogen/ERα inhibits the proliferation of human VSMCs and prevents their transition from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). Regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis involves the coordinated actions of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA-encoded proteins, including NRF-1, NRF-2, TFAM, and PGC-1α (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Klinge, 2017</xref>). ERα activation upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of NRF1 and elevated the transcript and protein levels of the protease OMI/HtrA2 in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (IMS) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Münch, 2018</xref>). NRF1 can regulate proteasome levels, mitochondrial transcription, and respiration, while OMI is a serine protease that can modulate cellular apoptosis (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Münch, 2018</xref>). However, further investigation is needed to determine whether the NRF1-OMI signaling pathway is involved in vascular remodeling and phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>In the current study, we investigated whether ERα regulates phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs under simulated microgravity. To investigate the underlying mechanism, pharmacological and genetic manipulation of ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling was used to determine whether the NRF1-OMI-mitophagy signaling pathway was involved in this process.</p>

                <p>Hindlimb unweighting (HU) was used to simulate microgravity in male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 180–200 g as described previously (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). Briefly, the rat’s tail was hung on a hook at the top of the cage through a chain. Only its forelimbs could contact with the floor of the cage, permitting the rat full access to the entire cage. All rats were caged individually in specific pathogen-free conditions, received standard laboratory chow and water. The room was maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle, 22 ± 1°C. Propyl pyrazole triol (PPT), a selective ERα agonist, was injected subcutaneously from day 3 of modeling at 30 μg/kg/day (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Bansal and Chopra, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy, was injected intraperitoneally at 25 mg/kg/day.

                <p>To investigate whether ERα is involved in synthetic phenotype switching of VSMCs under simulated microgravity, we examined the protein/mRNA abundance of phenotypic markers and ERα in HU rat cerebral VSMCs. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>, compared with controls, the protein abundance of SM-MHC, α-SMA, calponin, caldesmon and ERα gradually decreased, while the protein abundance of OPN and PCNA gradually increased in the HU rat cerebral VSMCs. At the transcriptional level, the mRNA level of <italic>Esr1</italic> also gradually decreased during HU (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, FBS induces synthetic transition of VSMCs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). At the transcriptional level, the mRNA levels of Myh11 and Esr1 gradually decreased, while the mRNA level of Spp1 gradually increased (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In FBS-treated VSMCs, the expression of SM-MHC, α-SMA, calponin, caldesmon and ERα gradually decreased, while the protein levels of OPN and PCNA gradually increased in a timedependent manner (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E,F</xref>).

                <title>Estrogen receptor <italic>α</italic> increases mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial biogenesis</title>
                <p>Regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis involves the coordinated actions of both mtDNA and nuclear-encoded gene products, including NRF-1, NRF-2, TFAM, and PGC-1α (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Klinge, 2017</xref>). Previous studies have shown that ERα regulates mitochondrial function, dynamics, and turnover in pancreatic β-cells and skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ribas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we assessed the effects of ERα on mitochondrial biology in VSMCs. Compared with controls, HU induced a significant reduction in mtDNA copy number in cerebral VSMCs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, FBS-treated VSMCs showed a reduced mtDNA number, which was reversed by ERα overexpression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The above data were further validated by the decreased expression of <italic>Ppargc1α</italic> and genes encoding proteins of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain (ETC), including <italic>Ppargc1β</italic>, <italic>Nrf1</italic>, <italic>Nrf2</italic>, <italic>Tfam</italic>, <italic>Plog1</italic>, <italic>Plog2 and Polrmt,</italic> in FBS-treated VSMCs, which was partially restored by ERα overexpression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The protein abundance of these genes was also decreased and reversed by ERα overexpression (<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). <italic>Polg1</italic> and <italic>Polg2</italic> encode the catalytic and accessory subunits of polymerase γ, respectively, and the latter enhances DNA binding and promotes processive DNA synthesis. ERα can induce <italic>Plog1</italic> expression by binding to the Plog1 promoter (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that ERα regulates mtDNA replication and transcription in VSMCs. Furthermore, we also detected reduced protein abundance of representative subunits of the electron transport chain, as well as significantly attenuated maximal cellular respiration and mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity in serum-treated VSMCs, which were all alleviated by ERα overexpression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D–F</xref>). In conclusion, these findings suggested that ERα controls mtDNA copy number, biogenesis, and respiration of mitochondria during dedifferentiation of VSMCs.</p>

                <p>mtDNA replication is closely linked with mitochondrial dynamics and turnover; therefore, we investigated mitochondrial fusion-fission and mitophagy signaling. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, treatment of VSMCs with FBS induced mitochondrial fission, which was significantly inhibited by ERα overexpression. The outer mitochondrial membrane docking protein mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1) and phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission regulator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at its activation site Ser616 (DRP S616) were significantly upregulated in FBS-treated VSMCs, and ERα overexpression significantly inhibited them and blocked mitochondrial fission (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B,C</xref>). In addition, mitochondrial fusion proteins (Mfn1 and Mfn2) were decreased in FBS-treated VSMCs, which was also reversed by ERα overexpression. This is consistent with our previous study, which showed an elongated and hyperfused mitochondrial morphology in synthetic VSMCs of cerebral arteries of HU rats (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

                <p>In parallel with the diminished fission-fusion dynamics, mitophagy signaling of parkin and pink was attenuated in FBS-treated cells, which was restored by ERα overexpression (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). As the accumulation of PINK1 in the OMM is critical for mitophagy initiation, we performed mitochondrial isolation studies. As shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D,E</xref>, in mitochondria, the treatment of VSMCs with FBS significantly decreased the expression of ERα, Parkin and PINK1, while in the cytosol, FBS significantly increased the expression of ERα and Parkin, with PINK1 being unchanged. These data suggested that FBS-induced ERα downregulation causes a reduction in Park family protein levels and implicates increased PINK1/Parkin protein turnover as a potential mechanism for inhibited mitophagy signaling. Together, these results support the notion that ERα is critical for mitochondrial health surveillance and mitophagy signaling.</p>

                <p>Activation of the ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling pathway, that is, the UPR<sup>mt</sup>-ERα axis, augments the protein quality control system to prevent the import and accumulation of defective proteins in the IMS. ERα activation upregulated mRNA and protein levels of NRF1 and elevated transcript and protein levels of the protease OMI/HtrA2 in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (IMS) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Münch, 2018</xref>). Previous studies suggested that dysfunctional OMI was associated with impaired autophagy (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>), while its roles in regulating mitophagy are unknown. Adenovirus and siRNA of OMI were established to overexpress and downregulate OMI (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A,B</xref>). In FBS-treated VSMCs, OMI overexpression increased the level of parkin in mitochondria but not in the cytosol (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). However, OMI knockdown significantly inhibited the expression of parkin in the cytosol and mitochondria, with a more pronounced trend in mitochondria (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, OMI overexpression in VSMCs increased the steady-state level of Parkin compared with control transfectants, which was remarkably boosted by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the protease inhibitor leupeptin. Pulse chase analysis showed that Parkin stability was remarkably augmented by OMI expression, especially in the presence of MG132 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4F,G</xref>).

                <title>ERα-NRF1-OMI regulates the macroautophagy and mitophagy flux</title>
                <p>To elucidate whether ERα-NRF1-OMI regulates mitophagy in A7r5 cells, we evaluated markers of macroautophagy required for mitochondrial turnover by lysosomes, including Beclin, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 processing. The serum significantly inhibited the expression of these markers and the ratio of LC3 II/LC3 I (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that serum inhibited the overlap between lysosomes and mitochondria in VSMCs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C,D</xref>). The above alterations were reversed by ERα and OMI overexpression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A–D</xref>). The mitophagy activator (FCCP) and inhibitor (3-MA) were used to verify whether the repressed mitophagy was associated with defective mitochondrial accumulation and apoptosis activation. Compared with the control, FBS reduced LC3 II and mitochondrial colocalization in VSMCs, which was also protected by ERα and OMI overexpression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E,F</xref>). FBS upregulated the expression of caspase9/3 and induced cyt-c diffusion into the cytoplasm, which was impeded by ERα and OMI overexpression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G–H</xref>). Mitophagy inhibition caused cyt-c release and upregulated caspase9/3 expression, while mitophagy activation under ERα and OMI overexpression further inhibited these changes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G,H</xref>). In conclusion, these data suggest that the treatment of VSMCs with FBS prevents mitophagy from clearing dysfunctional mitochondria and results in increased apoptosis, while the ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling pathway can preserve mitophagy and limit cyt-c leakage.</p>

              <p>The results of this study suggest, for the first time to the best of the authors’ knowledge, that ERα regulates phenotype switching and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells through the NRF1-OMI-mitophagy signaling pathway under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>Spaceflight is known to impose changes on human vasculature with unknown molecular etiologies. Region-specific vascular remodeling during microgravity exposure contributes to postflight cardiovascular deconditioning and orthostatic intolerance (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Ground-based microgravity simulation showed synthetic phenotypic transition and proliferation of cerebral VSMCs (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>), and mitochondrial oxidative stress plays an important role in this process (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). Multiomics and systems biology analyses using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA’s GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space found that spaceflight causes changes in gene expression related to mitochondrial ATP synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Da Silveira et al., 2020</xref>), which indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in cardiovascular deconditioning and cardiovascular diseases related to microgravity exposure. In mitochondrial dysfunction, both perturbations in proteostasis and impairment of mitochondrial metabolic functions activate the UPR<sup>mt</sup>. The activation of CHOP, ERα and SIRT3 has been indicated in UPR<sup>mt</sup>, which reduces proteotoxic stress and maintains mitochondrial integrity (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Papa and Germain, 2014</xref>). However, whether ERα regulates vascular remodeling during microgravity exposure is unclear. In the present study, we found that ERα was positively associated with contractile phenotype switching but inversely correlated with synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of VSMCs both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Loss of ERα is correlated with reduced mtDNA copy number, disturbed mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, and perturbed fission-fusion-mitophagy signaling. Mechanistically, our data suggested that the ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling pathway regulated Parkin stability through the UPS. In line with this, we found that activating ERα signaling by PPT could alleviate the synthetic phenotype switching and proliferation of cerebral arteries by reestablishing fission-fusion-mitophagy hemostasis. To our knowledge, we are the first to reveal that the ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling pathway participates in cerebrovascular remodeling under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>ERα plays critical roles in regulating mitochondrial function, including bioenergetics, dynamics, and respiration (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Klinge, 2020</xref>). Impaired mitochondrial fission-fusion flux is an important contributor to altered mitochondrial bioenergetics. Uncontrolled mitochondrial fission produces large amounts of mitochondrial debris that damage the mitochondrial genome and aberrant cristae, which disrupt normal mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Xian and Liou, 2019</xref>). In MCF7 human breast cancer cells, E2 induced mitochondrial fission through phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 <italic>via</italic> ERα (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Oo et al., 2018</xref>). However, ERα depletion in MIN6 β-cells markedly reduced both mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins, including Drp1, Mff, Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1, and the mitochondria exhibited an elongated phenotype (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In the absence of ERα, there is an increase in cellular respiration and ROS production that is associated with aberrant mitochondrial cristae morphology (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Both the mitochondrial fission proteins Drp1, Drp1<sup>Ser616</sup>, and FIS1 and the mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 were significantly reduced in <italic>Esr1</italic>-KD 3T3L1 adipocytes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Esr1</italic> knockdown induced the mitochondria toward a fusion phenotype in brown adipose tissue but not white adipose tissue (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). In skeletal muscle, the loss of ERα significantly increased Drp1 phosphorylation at the inhibitory residue Ser637 and the expression of OPA1 and MFN2, promoting mitochondrial fusion even when the fission-related outer mitochondrial membrane Drp1 anchoring protein FIS1 was markedly reduced (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ribas et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, the myotube Esr1 deficiency caused a 50% reduction in fatty acid oxidation and a concomitant increase in fatty acid storage into complex lipids relative to control myotubes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ribas et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the ERα depletion-induced mitochondria morphology is not only determined by fission and fusion proteins but also the energy metabolic state and cellular requirements. In the present study, both the HU-induced and FBS-treated synthetic transition and proliferation of VSMCs were associated with uncontrolled mitochondrial fission and inhibited mitochondrial fusion, which were reversed by ERα overexpression. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that synthetic conversion of VSMCs and hyperproliferation of pulmonary VSMCs were accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, decreased glucose oxidation and increased fatty acid oxidation (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bonnet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Salabei and Hill, 2013</xref>). In aggregate, the decreased expression of ERα seems to promote mitochondrial fission even in synthetic VSMCs, and the underlying mechanism needs to be clarified.</p>
              <p>It has been suggested that a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential initiates mitophagy to remove damaged mitochondria and avoid excessive ROS generation. This process requires mitochondrial fission and division of damaged organelles from the network (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Palikaras et al., 2018</xref>). Under stress conditions, reduced ATP production, which negatively regulates mTORC1 and ROS/BNIP3 and increases mPTP opening, can initiate mitophagy signaling. As described previously, upon exposure to microgravity, mitochondrial ROS increased mPTP opening and fission signaling, decreased membrane potential and deteriorated ATP production and respiration (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). However, mitophagy was inhibited under simulated microgravity in the present study, which disrupted the cellular self-repair mechanism of VSMCs. Furthermore, the decreased levels of Parkin and Pink and impaired mitophagy were reversed by ERα, indicating the important role of ERα in regulating mitophagy. Previously, studies have shown that ERα strongly affects early autophagic initiation and alters LC3 nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation and thereby influences sex-biased final autophagosome formation in medaka (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mohapatra et al., 2020</xref>). ERα directly interacts with NRF2, while both ERα and ERβ affect HK2 and LC3 activities (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Mohapatra et al., 2020</xref>). In postmenopausal women, upregulating ERα by estrogen induces autophagy, which downregulates NLRP3 inflammasome-IL1β-mediated inflammation and pyroptosis in vascular endothelial cells (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2021</xref>). The loss of ERα decreased the expression of Parkin and Pink1 in Min6 β-cells, C2C12 myotubes and skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ribas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), while Esr1-KD 3T3L1 adipocytes and gWAT and iWAT of female ERα knockout mice significantly increased the expression of Parkin (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that mitochondrial fusion-fission-mitophagy signaling is complex, and energy demand and metabolic features should be considered when interpreting the tissue-specific alterations after ERα depletion.</p>
              <p>The UPR<sup>mt</sup>-ERα axis is dependent on ERα, and its downstream protein OMI is a protease that can impede misfolded proteins in mitochondria and maintain the normal function of mitochondria. Recently, studies have shown that loss of OMI increases the number of dysfunctional mitochondria, subunits of the ETC and ROS production and decreases ATP generation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Moisoi et al., 2009</xref>). It was found that when MEFs were treated with stressors, autophagy was activated, which paralleled the increased OMI levels, suggesting that OMI expression-induced autophagy enhancement may be a protective phenomenon (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2008</xref>). Numerous studies have discovered that animals lacking OMI/HtrA2 or with OMI/HtrA2 inhibition exhibited deficiencies in autophagy and symptoms of accelerated aging (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), and overexpression of OMI/HtrA2 in cells promoted autophagy by degrading the Beclin1 inhibitory protein HAX1 (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike autophagy, evidence of mitophagy regulation by OMI/HtrA2 is lacking. To determine the roles of OMI/HtrA2 and its underlying mechanism, the expression and protein stability of parkin and its role in macroautophagy and mitophagy were examined. The results showed that Parkin levels were decreased and mitophagy was inhibited after OMI downregulation, and Parkin expression and mitophagy were preserved after ERα and OMI overexpression. Further research suggested that Parkin stability is preserved in the presence of OMI, indicating that UPR–ERα-OMI signaling activates mitophagy to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in VSMCs.</p>
              <p>Mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics are closely related to the phenotype of VSMCs. Previous studies have shown that uncontrolled mitochondrial fission results in ROS overproduction (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2016</xref>) and generates excessive mitochondrial debris that damages the mitochondrial genome and disrupts normal mitochondrial respiration and ATP production (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Xian and Liou, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial debris promotes the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the leakage of cytochrome c, which ultimately induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2022</xref>). In Ang II-infused mice, the dedifferentiation of VSMCs and vascular remodeling are associated with increased levels of p-DRP1 S616 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), while Mdivi-1 inhibits fission and blocks Ang II-induced phenotypic switching of VSMCs (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Deng et al., 2021</xref>). In spontaneously hypertensive or atherosclerosis-prone rats, Mfn-2 levels were diminished in VSMCs, while Mfn2 overexpression inhibited the proliferation of VSMCs and sensitized them to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2007</xref>). Previously, we found increased mPTP, a reduced mitochondrial respiratory control ratio, increased fission, and inhibited fusion in HU rat cerebral VSMCs, which was reversed by MitoTEMPO (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we further confirmed that disturbed mitochondrial dynamics were involved in the synthetic phenotype switching of VSMCs and were associated with inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we also investigated the roles of ERα in mitochondrial dynamics and found that excessive mitochondrial fission was protected by ERα activation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, in E2-treated MCF7 cells, phosphorylation of Drp1 at S616 is dependent on ERα (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Oo et al., 2018</xref>). In our opinion, the completely different characteristics of the two cell lines may be the underlying mechanism.</p>
              <p>The limitations still exist. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> models were used in present work to investigate the molecular mechanism of phenotypic switching of VSMCs. We intended to investigate the molecular mechanism on cell-based models and perform phenotypic verification on animal-based models. Although the <italic>in vivo</italic> serum-induced A7r5 dedifferentiation cannot fully simulate the increased transmural pressure of HU rat cerebral VSMCs, the previous studies have shown that there are common mechanisms such as the T-type CaV3.1 channel and RhoA kinase in serum-induced and microgravity-induced synthetic switching of VSMCs (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>).</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the findings of the current study clarified a novel mechanism of UPR<sup>mt</sup>-mitophagy in which inhibited ERα-NRF1-OMI signaling and mitophagy resulted in phenotypic switching of VSMCs and cerebrovascular remodeling under simulated microgravity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of activation of the ERα axis of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> during microgravity exposure. Additionally, further research is needed to examine the interaction between the ERα and SIRT3 axes of UPR<sup>mt</sup> and their roles in vascular remodeling. A full understanding of the ERα axis in UPR<sup>mt</sup> enables targeting of the mitochondrial network for intervention in vascular remodeling and postflight cardiovascular deconditioning in astronauts.</p>
