                <p>Adverse effects of spaceflight on musculoskeletal health increase the risk of bone injury and impairment of fracture healing. Its yet elusive molecular comprehension warrants immediate attention, since space travel is becoming more frequent. Here we examined the effects of spaceflight on bone fracture healing using a 2 mm femoral segmental bone defect (SBD) model. Forty, 9-week-old, male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 4 groups: 1) Sham surgery on Ground (G-Sham); 2) Sham surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Sham); 3) SBD surgery on Ground (G-Surgery); and 4) SBD surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Surgery). Surgery procedures occurred 4 days prior to launch; post-launch, the spaceflight mice were house in the rodent habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 4 weeks before euthanasia. Mice remaining on the Earth were subjected to identical housing and experimental conditions. The right femur from half of the spaceflight and ground groups was investigated by micro-computed tomography (µCT). In the remaining mice, the callus regions from surgery groups and corresponding femoral segments in sham mice were probed by global transcriptomic and metabolomic assays. µCT confirmed escalated bone loss in FLT-Sham compared to G-Sham mice. Comparing to their respective on-ground counterparts, the morbidity gene-network signal was inhibited in sham spaceflight mice but activated in the spaceflight callus. µCT analyses of spaceflight callus revealed increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity. Activated apoptotic signals in spaceflight callus were synchronized with inhibited cell migration signals that potentially hindered the wound site to recruit growth factors. A major pro-apoptotic and anti-migration gene network, namely the RANK-NFκB axis, emerged as the central node in spaceflight callus. Concluding, spaceflight suppressed a unique biomolecular mechanism in callus tissue to facilitate a failed regeneration, which merits a customized intervention strategy.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="p0005">There is a legitimate concern that the compromised musculoskeletal physiology in spaceflight will place astronauts at a high risk for bone fracture <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The musculoskeletal disuse driven by chronic unloading is probably the major contributing factor for the bone loss in spaceflight <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Moreover, compromised musculoskeletal health could be causally related to the “polytraumatic milieu” of spaceflight, which embodies complex relationships among weightlessness, radiation, and various disrupted biological functions, including circadian rhythm, immune functions, and metabolism <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is likely that this polytraumatic milieu in spaceflight could also be detrimental to fracture healing by diminishing the chances of recovery. This idea is supported by our previous study showing that spaceflight potentially damages several key regenerative mechanisms by suppressing bioenergetics, triggering immunodeficiency, and inhibiting growth factors <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0010">The acute response of bone fracture healing is an energy expensive process that fosters the recruitment of growth factors and cytokines to initiate recovery <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Spaceflight can cause energy deprivation <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and potentially impedes recruiting healing-critical agents such as growth factors at the wound site <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>; therefore, it would be difficult to sustain a self-healing process in spaceflight, and a countermeasure would be necessary. Nevertheless, identifying a spaceflight-specific therapeutic target is a major challenge, since a holistic characterization of its healing cascade is difficult to comprehend due to limited availability of spaceflight data <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Past reports estimated that the astronauts’ femoral neck strength decreased at a rate of 5.0% per month in spaceflight <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Additional reports predicted that the spaceflight-induced cortical and trabecular bone mass loss could have long-term, adverse consequences to overall bone integrity <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; particularly when the astronauts return to Earth or land on a reduced gravity planetary surface, such as Mars or the Moon <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The positive correlation between spaceflight duration and compromised musculoskeletal health was underscored by a predictive bone fracture model <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0015">Fracture non-union remains an important orthopedic complication. A complex and well-orchestrated series of physiological events are necessary for successful bone healing and regeneration <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Overall, these events are broadly classified into two overlapping phases, namely the metabolic phase and biological phase. The metabolic phase begins with anabolic processes that includes the initiation of skeletal and vascular tissues. At the transition stage from the anabolic to catabolic activities, the bone secondary structures begin to form. Eventually, the catabolic activities predominate as bone structure regains its pre-injury state <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This entire episode is supported by three major biological phases that longitudinally advance from the inflammatory phase, to the endochondral bone formation phase, to the bone remodeling phase. Sub-optimal performance of these metabolic and/or biological phases can result in impaired bone regeneration.</p>
              <p id="p0020">Current reports indicate that approximately 12.5% of the femoral shaft fractures result in non-union <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Clinical management of traumatic or infection induced segmental bone defect (SBD) injuries, typically involves bone grafting with a frame or use of cement spacers as commonly referred to as the Masquelet technique <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> followed by bone grafting (a 2-stage procedure). In some cases, at the time of surgery, surgeons apply a collagen membrane impregnated with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) to the SBD site to improve bone healing. On the other hand, clinical management of SBDs following tumor resection typically require bulk allograft or similar “scaffolding” materials for successful bone repair. Many times orthopedic surgeons use hollow rods to stabilize the fracture site. Most patients with SBD injuries will undergo prolonged rehabilitation and limited weightbearing/bedrest following surgery <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Prolonged skeletal unloading often causes osteopenia to further complicate the healing trajectory <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Clearly, SBDs are anatomically and medically complex injuries that are remarkably difficult to treat, and prolonged disuse of limbs, such is the condition in spaceflight and the bedridden patient, further complicates recovery <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0025">Characterization of the interconnectedness between the spaceflight induced prolonged disuse and bone fracture is critical to design precise osteoinductive interventions for space travelers. The present spaceflight study used a critical sized, 2 mm SBD model, which does not typically heal on the ground without additional therapeutic intervention, such as treatment with BMP-2 or other bone healing drugs. We selected this SBD model as compared to a closed fracture model for multiple reasons, such as: 1) SBD’s standardized fracture pattern (e.g. reduced comminution and misalignment), fracture location, and the reduction of associated complications compared to the use of the closed Einhorn fracture model <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>; and 2) the potentially reduced soft tissue injury in SBD model compared to the closed Einhorn fracture model (e.g. crush injury to the quadriceps) <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In addition, SBD model is an ideal platform to investigate the efficacy of bone healing drugs <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0030">We hypothesize that this femoral SBD mouse model <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, when subjected to spaceflight, will trigger a differential fracture healing trajectory compared to that in the mice with SBD on ground. In concert, the pan-omics landscape will likely be altered via a unique fashion because of the cumulative impact of bone injury and spaceflight induced stress. To meet this objective, our Rodent Research 4 (RR4) project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-4-spacex-10" id="ir005"><underline>https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-4-spacex-10</underline></ext-link>) investigated the impact of spaceflight on <italic>in vivo</italic> SBD repair. C57BL/6J mice with and without SBD surgery were group-housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 24–28 days. Age-matched mice with and without SBDs were housed on the Earth at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) inside identical spaceflight hardware maintained in identical conditions including diet, temperature, light cycle, humidity, etc. Our previous µCT results from investigating this RR4 cohort <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> revealed that spaceflight (without surgery) and surgery (on ground or in spaceflight), all resulted in a loss of trabecular bone in the ipsilateral tibia. However, the mode of consequences of all three stressful scenarios were apparently different from each other. In other words, the trabecular bone loss in the ipsilateral tibia in spaceflight mice subjected to SBD surgery was not entirely an accumulative effect of the surgery on ground and the effects of spaceflight on sham mice. Our additional study to probe the adaptation process of the skeleton to spaceflight <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> underscored the necessity in examining the local wound site to better characterize the influence of spaceflight on the SBD repair processes at a single snapshot in time (∼4 weeks post-surgery). Here we present a systems integration of global transcriptomic and metabolomic assays tied with µCT readouts of the callus to find the underlying molecular mechanisms of bone fracture healing with and without the spaceflight induced unloading. This bone related outcome is also presented in the context of past studies on the quadriceps, where multi-omics investigation revealed significant energy deprivation in weight-bearing muscles of sham mice in the spaceflight <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Finally, these analyses will serve as key baseline data for future comparisons to spaceflight SBD mice treated with BMP-2 or other bone healing agents.</p>

Four days prior to launch, after an acclimation period of 10 days, the mouse cages were randomized into 4 groups (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>): 1) Sham surgery on Ground (G-Sham); 2) Sham surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Sham); 3) SBD surgery on Ground (G-Surgery); and 4) SBD surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Surgery). The surgical procedure was carried out as previously described <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine-Xylazine (125–20 mg/kg), and the right hindleg was shaved from 1 cm distal to the knee joint to midline. The leg was then prepped with ethanol and Betadine three times each in an alternating fashion to ensure limb sterility. After the anesthetic plane was confirmed, a one cm incision was then made over the right femoral midshaft extending to the knee joint. The knee was flexed, and a 27-gauge hypodermic needle was inserted into the distal end of the femur and passed in a retrograde fashion into the intramedullary canal. A sterile Dremel rotary cutting tool (Dremel Inc. Racine, WI) was then used to remove a 2 mm segment from the midpoint of the femoral diaphysis. Next, a previously characterized, custom made, 2 mm poly(propylene fumarte)/tricalcium phosphate graft was inserted at the defect site to maintain defect size <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The previously placed needle was advanced through the graft and proximal femoral intramedullary canal through the greater trochanter. The needle tip was then bent back on itself and the needle pulled anterograde to stabilize and align the femoral defect. The needle was then cut at the distal end of the femur and a saline-soaked collagen sponge (RCM6 Resorbable Collagen Membrane, ACE, Brockton, MA) was wrapped around the scaffold and sutured into place. The muscle was closed with simple Vicryl suture and the skin was closed using wound clips (7 mm, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA). Once the mice recovered from anesthesia, they were provided with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) for analgesia, and then were returned to their original cages with K3392 Rest Stops (Bio-Serve, Flemington, NJ) for the first 2 days to assist with recovery. Of note, surgical complications were observed in less than 5% of the mice. After the 2-day recovery period, the 10 healthiest mice per group (as determined by NASA veterinarians in collaboration with authors MAK and PJC by visual inspection of surgery sites, the overall activity levels, and condition of the mice) were transferred into spaceflight housing 2 days prior to launch. The FLT-Sham and FLT-Surgery mice were housed in NASA Rodent Transporters while in the SpaceX Dragon capsule, and on February 19, 2017, these mice were launched into space via Space X-10 vehicle operated under commercial resupply services (CRS)-10 mission <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. After 5 days, they were moved to International Space Station’s (ISS) NASA rodent research Habitat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-hardware" id="ir010"><underline>https://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/rodent-research-hardware</underline></ext-link>), where they lived for the next 24–28 days until euthanasia. It should be noted that upon transfer of mice to the Habitat hardware on the ISS (and on the ground at KSC), the 10 group-housed Sham or Surgery mice were randomly subdivided into 2 groups of 5 mice because the Habitat holds a maximum of 5 mice per side (2 sides/Habitat). The G-Sham and G-Surgery cohorts were housed in identical spaceflight hardware and treated as identically as possible; 5 days asynchronous to spaceflight cohorts in order to best simulate spaceflight conditions. Importantly, weekly orders of mice were delivered from Jackson Laboratories to ensure properly aged mice for possible delays in launch. Therefore asynchronous ground controls were ∼2 days younger in age than flight mice, which is negligible in terms of bone status/growth in 9- and 13- week-old mice (the approximate age and the time of surgery and euthanasia). To note, this manuscript represents 20 spaceflight mice, which was a part of a total of 40 mice that were sent to the ISS during this mission. The other 20 mice also had surgery but were treated with BMP-2 and a novel bone healing agent, thrombopoietin. Those data are still being processed and will be described in future reports.</p>

                <p id="p0050">Mice were euthanized at 24–28 days post-launch when mice were approximately 13 weeks of age. The extended time range was due to the significant time it takes to accomplish tasks in spaceflight. For these studies, the astronauts were able to euthanize and collect samples from a maximum of 8 mice per day. Euthanasia was performed by injection of ketamine/xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) followed by closed chest cardiac puncture with blood withdrawal and cervical dislocation. Each group of 10 mice was subdivided into two groups of 5 mice. For 5 mice/group, the right hindlimb was removed at the hip and stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C until they were returned to Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) approximately 2 weeks after euthanasia. After arrival at IUSM, the right hindlimb samples were washed with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), transferred to ice cold 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C until being imaged by micro-computed tomography (µCT). The remaining mouse carcass was stored in aluminum foil in NASA’s cold stowage, which is at or below −80 °C on the ISS until transfer back to cold storage on Earth at −80 °C. For the other one-half of mice in each group, the whole carcass was left intact and stored in aluminum foil at or below −80 °C. The carcasses remained at −80 °C or lower until they arrived at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (erstwhile, US Army Center for Environmental Health Research or USACEHR) at Fort Detrick, MD approximately 2 weeks after euthanasia.</p>
                <p id="p0055">Following a well-practiced protocol, the mice were then partially thawed and tissue dissection for each carcass was completed in approximately 45 min. After dissection, individual tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until processing.</p>

                <p id="p0065">Prior to µCT analysis, all callus segments (or equivalent femora sections of sham mice) were briefly thawed and the surrounding soft tissue removed. Surgical pins were carefully removed at this time. Each femur was then fixed for 72 h in 10% NBF, washed with PBS, and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. All femora were imaged using a desktop SCANCO µCT35 imaging system (SCANCO Medical, Bruttisellen, Switzerland). All scans were obtained at 55 kV using a 12 µm voxel size. A 3D analysis was performed taking the entire callus area as the region of interest (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B) in which the following morphometric parameters were measured: (1) tissue volume (TV), in mm<sup>3</sup>: the total callus volume; (2) bone volume (BV)/TV, in %: the woven bone fraction, which was expressed as a percentage of the callus volume; (3) connectivity density (Conn.D), in 1/mm<sup>3</sup>: the connectivity density normalized by TV; (4) structure model index (SMI), where 0 stands for parallel plates and 3 for cylindrical rods; (5) tissue mineral density (TMD), in 1/cm<sup>3</sup>: mean callus density; (6) bone surface (BS), in mm<sup>2</sup>: bone surface area; (7) BS/BV, in 1/mm: relative bone surface; (8) trabecular number (Tb.N), in 1/mm; (9) trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), in mm; and (10) trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), in mm. The callus area or region of interest was manually drawn using the SCANCO software for each specimen by one reader who was blinded to groupings. The cortical bone and the scaffolds were isolated and were not included in the analyses. Further, it should be noted that the nomenclature used is in accordance to the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>; however, these parameters are for standard bone parameters and while not specific for fracture healing, they are commonly adapted for assessing callus quantity and quality.

Using this method, the medial, lateral, anterior, and posterior cortices on anteroposterior and lateral µCT images were scored. Each cortex was given a score of 1 (no bridging), 2 (partial bridging), or 3 (complete bridging). The total score is equal to the sum of the scores from all 4 cortices ranging from 4 (not healed) to 12 (maximally healed). All images were scored by 3 blinded readers and the average scores were reported.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Microcomputed images of femurs containing 2 mm SBD approximately 4 weeks after surgery. (A) Microcomputed image showed hardware failures only observed in G-Surgery mice. On ground, the SBD mouse typically becomes ambulatory immediately after recovery from anesthesia. This application of pressure to the scaffold can it break over time if healing does not occur. Unloading in spaceflight potentially allowed the scaffold to remain intact for a longer period of time. No FLT-Surgery picture is added, since this incidence was ground specific. (B) The images showed that complete bone bridging was not observed in either the G-Surgery or FLT-Surgery mice. Without any therapeutic intervention, this size of SBD does not typically heal on ground, and the present study showed that prolonged disuse of limbs in spaceflight also cannot facilitate healing of the 2 mm SBD.

However, no clear separation was observed in two-dimensional PCA figure when all Sham and Surgery cohorts across spaceflight and ground groups were included. Differential gene expression analysis found 452 DEGs between FLT-Sham and G-Sham, which included 366 upregulated and 86 down regulated genes in spaceflight versus ground specimens.

The Sham group enlisted four significantly perturbed non-canonical networks that included three activated networks and one inhibited network in the FLT-Sham group compared to the G-Sham group. The networks linked to transcription, cellular homeostasis, and quantity of cells were activated, and the network linked to morbidity was inhibited in FLT-Sham specimens compared to G-Sham specimens.

                <title>RR4, a unique condition to promote musculoskeletal atrophy</title>
                <p id="p0160">Astronauts returning from space have experienced 1–1.6% per month loss of lower limb bone mineral density <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and a 15%-20% per year reduction in the bending and compressive strength of bones <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Considering that fewer than 600 humans have travelled to space, and most of them stayed for less than three weeks in low-earth orbit, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system. It remains elusive whether the rapid and intense rate of bone loss in spaceflight will persist over a multiple-year mission or if it will diminish over time to reach an equilibrium state; and rather importantly, how this compromised musculoskeletal health will affect bone injuries and repair processes. To address these questions, the RR4 project supported the first space mission to study a male mouse cohort that underwent a SBD surgery in their femoral midshaft. SBD healing in a mouse femur represents a challenging, yet practical bone fracture model.</p>
                <p id="p0165">Conventional musculoskeletal injury models on ground have major limitations in simulating the human paradigm. The reason is the following- the rodents ambulate, bearing weight on their injured limbs immediately after the anesthetic wears off; whereas humans with similar limb injuries have limited to no weight bearing for a significant period of time, of up to 6 months <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Hence, the acute mechanical loading due to pre-mature ambulation in rodents, potentially improves fracture healing; contrastingly, a prolonged unloading is likely to impair human bone healing efficacy. In potential agreement, we observed that at least one of the five scaffolds (20%) broke in the G-Surgery mice; on the other hand, no scaffold breakage was observed in FLT-Surgery mice, likely attributed to the weightlessness condition in spaceflight that allowed prolonged unloading of the rodents’ weight bearing limbs <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. While the differential acute and premature applications of weight bearing on the femoral SBD in spaceflight vs. on ground could be the cause of the scaffold breakage, no affirmative conclusion is drawn due to the small sample size. In this context, it is important to note that our past observation using the same model showed that the scaffold structure and hardware (hollow needle) was able to tolerate the vibration and hypergravity associated with launch, and the healing dynamics were most likely not influenced by the spaceflight launch <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Taking all of these factors in account, examining fracture healing in spaceflight arguably has some critical advantages over conventional Earth-based model.</p>
                <p id="p0170">The RR4 project presented an opportunity to probe the potential SBD healing over 24–28 days of onboard space mission. By estimation, the 28 days of rodent life is equivalent to more than two years of human lifetime <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and nearly 4% of rodent life; hence, RR4 mice spent a much longer fraction of their life in space than humans recorded to date. Previous studies examining the femur of RR4 sham mice reported significant reductions in trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV, 25% decrease) and trabecular number (Tb.N, 4.9% decrease), associated with a significant increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, 6.9% increase) in spaceflight (FLT-Sham) compared to ground (G-Sham) femurs <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Expanding on this report, the present study probed the impact of the RR4 spaceflight mission on the healing of a femoral SBD. The defect size inflicted in the RR4 mice is considered a critical sized defect, which by definition, is not expected to be healed without therapeutic intervention <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Indeed our µCT data demonstrated no sign of bridging in either spaceflight (FLT-Surgery) and ground (G-Surgery) mice. Rather subtle signs, such as increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity in the spaceflight callus suggested an escalated risk of bone non-union that might correlate with poor bone quality and lower mechanical integrity in spaceflight.</p>

                <title>Gene-metabolite networks linked to spaceflight induced bone loss</title>
                <p id="p0175">Spaceflight emerged as the primary factor to explain the genomic and metabolomic perturbations in both Sham and Surgery groups. Reduced femoral bone mass in FLT-Sham mice co-occurred with the activated molecular signal linked to cellular homeostasis. Balancing the extracellular stress and intracellular responses, the cellular homeostasis signal plays a major role in aiding cell survival <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In agreement, the morbidity signal was inhibited in FLT-Sham mice. This cumulative picture of the Sham network analysis possibly suggests an underlying molecular program that acted against further femoral bone loss in spaceflight 24–28 days post-launch. A recent study has drawn a similar conclusion investigating hindlimb unloading (HLU) as a musculoskeletal disuse model on ground <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In their study, 14-days long HLU triggered an early onset of apoptosis in the femoral osteocyte cells, which reached a plateau between 5 and 15 days since the inception of HLU model. This putative arresting of apoptosis signal was concurrent with an escalation of trabecular bone resorption <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Interestingly, at least two other studies demonstrate the role of unloading-induced osteocyte apoptosis in the regulation of bone resorption <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, which is consistent with the current studies showing the upregulation of the apoptosis signal in FLT-Surgery mice.</p>
                <p id="p0180">In the Sham mice, there was a potential dissociation at the transcriptomic level between muscle and bone in responding to the spaceflight induced stress. Our recent analysis of the quadriceps muscle found a significant suppression of bioenergetics that was orchestrated with immune deficiency and metabolic dysfunction in FLT-Sham mice in comparison to G-Sham mice after 24–28 days space travel <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, the apoptosis gene networks and bioenergetics networks linked to genes and metabolites were unperturbed in the FLT-Sham femurs compared to G-Sham femurs. Therefore, we speculate that the muscle tissue possibly showed a delayed adaptability to the stress in comparison to the bone tissues, which is a typical characteristic differences between the healing trajectories of muscle and bone, respectively <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p>

                <title>SBD, a dominating factor over spaceflight impacts</title>
                <p id="p0185">The molecular landscape of FLT-Surgery callus depicted a very different scenario from FLT-Sham femur. The molecular shifts of the sham femur towards the adaptation of the spaceflight induced stress were overwhelmed by the new surge of molecular perturbations triggered by SBD in spaceflight. In FLT-Surgery callus, the active morbidity signal was synchronized with the upregulated apoptosis signal and suppressed cell migration network.</p>
                <p id="p0190">Theoretically, the longitudinal dynamics of fracture healing is a multi-phasic biomechanical process <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> that begins with an inflammatory phase, when cytokines and growth factors begin migrating from the neighboring cells to induce the osteogenic and angiogenic activities at the fracture site <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. The selective recruitment of extracellular matrix (ECM) components stimulates the activation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), chondrocytes, osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These cumulative efforts ultimately reach a milestone, at which time bone bridging across the fracture site begins. Expectedly, the critical sized bone defects in the RR4 mice failed to reach this milestone, as we found no sign of significant callus formation in the SBD of either the FLT-Surgery or G-Surgery groups. The molecular landscape in FLT-Surgery was particularly unfavorable for healing; the inhibition of the cell migration signal may have further impacted the failure of the spaceflight callus to recruit the key agents to activate MSCs and other cellular components essential for callus formation.</p>

                <title>Potential roles of gene-metabolite networks impeding healing in spaceflight</title>
                <p id="p0195">Migration of ECM to the callus is facilitated by the cross-collaboration among integrin, microtubule, and actin-myosin filaments <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, and all of these cytoskeletal elements were adversely affected in spaceflight. In FLT-Surgery, the inhibited integrin-NFκB interaction, a key modulator of cell migration <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>, potentially operated via an inhibited intermediator, namely the Tec kinase signal <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Furthermore, a compromised actin-myosin filament bundle in the FLT-Surgery callus was speculated, since a number of genes encoding myosin related proteins, such as MYL3, MYLK, MYB, and MYCPB were inhibited in FLT-Surgery compared to G-Surgery. The ‘master modulator’ of actin signal, namely Rho-family GTPase <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, which is known to reorganize the actin-myosin complex in non-muscular cells <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, became inhibited in FLT-Surgery callus. In harmony, BMP-2 gene that encodes an activator protein <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> and Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) gene that encodes an inhibitor protein <xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref> of Rho family GTPases emerged downregulated and activated, respectively in FLT-Surgery compared to G-Surgery. Of interest, BMP is a major chemoattractant of ECM <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; interestingly, BMP-7 gene was upregulated in FLT-Sham callus in comparison to G-Sham callus, but BMP-2 gene was downregulated in FLT-Surgery callus in comparison to G-Surgery callus. To note, both BMP-2 and -7 proteins are important in bone healing and they both trigger osteogenic and osteoclastic activities <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, although their degree of performances vary <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>.</p>
                <p id="p0200">The migration of the ECM components during the early bone fracture-healing phase typically coincides with the infiltration of T helper (T<sub>h</sub>) cells and thrombin to trigger inflammation and coagulation. Expression of NF-κB in T<sub>h</sub> cells has been attributed to the T<sub>h</sub> cell-induced immunological and apoptotic activities <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. Operation of T<sub>h</sub> cells is contingent upon the co-stimulatory activities of CD28 and CD40 pathways <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. We speculate that the suppression of both CD28 and CD40 networks in the FLT-Surgery callus could be attributed to the inactivation of the T<sub>h</sub> cells or reduced load of T<sub>h</sub> cells due to disrupted trafficking, or a combination of the two. A cluster of inhibited networks linked to cell migration potentially inform the impaired recruitment in callus; however, it is beyond the scope of RR4 study design to directly confirm the reduced load of T<sub>h</sub> cells in the callus.</p>
                <p id="p0205">Furthermore, SBD in spaceflight fostered a comprehensive inhibition of a procoagulant-antiapoptotic axis composed by the Thrombin signal and Gαq signal converging to the NFκB signal (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>. Other key procoagulant and angiogenic signals such as CXCR4 that depends on NFκB transcriptional activities <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref> emerged inhibited in FLT-Surgery callus in comparison to G-Surgery callus. Together, the NF-κB signal emerged as a critical hub network in the spaceflight callus, where most of the other significantly perturbed signals converged to exploit the pro-apoptotic and anti-migration scope of inhibited NF-κB <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. Moreover, the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) gene, which became inhibited in FLT-Surgery encodes a well-established regulator of bone resorption <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>.<fig id="f0030"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The pro-apoptotic and anti-cell migratory cluster of networks in FLT-Surgery.

                <title>Limitations and conclusions</title>
                <p id="p0210">The limitations of our study are primarily due to the inherent constraints associated with spaceflight as well as limitations of the SBD healing model. For instance, there are certain technical barriers and limited footprints allotted to conduct biological research on the ISS. Standard immunological tests to directly monitor the apoptosis or live cell migration are still not feasible to carry out on the ISS. Due to the small sample size, the histological study was precluded, and we relied on the integrative multi-omics approaches to support our claims. Extraction of high quality RNA from bone is always a challenge; and present protocol involved a freeze–thaw cycle that potentially further compromised the RNA quality extracted from bone. Hence, we were limited to run the cDNA array using RNA samples with sub-optimal quality. To mitigate the risk of generating false results, we administered strict cut-offs in the downstream analysis and validated results using multiple assays. We were refrained from determining any biomarkers associated with spaceflight induced musculoskeletal atrophy; rather this study was focused on informing about how a cluster of molecules and networks could respond to the stress compounding spaceflight and bone fracture. Gene perturbations are typically associated with early response to any extracellular stimuli; while the metabolites are generally the final derivative of biological functions. Therefore, the integrative gene and metabolite approach can inform time-dependent consequences of stress. The RR4 mission exclusively used male mice; hence, we could not illustrate sex-based differences in regulating the musculoskeletal health and bone repair <xref rid="b0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>.</p>
                <p id="p0215">With unlimited resources, many different or additional experimental design elements would have been added to these studies including the use of multiple fracture healing models rather than single SBD model, as a wide range of information can be obtained from different models. Additionally, multiple time points would have been examined including earlier and later time points. Indeed, earlier time points would have provided additional important information related to the molecular factors that govern whether a fracture will heal or not (possible biomarkers). Here an approximately 4 week time point was examined. The rationale was that for a critical sized defect model with use of thrombopoietin as a therapeutic for bone healing, complete bridging is not observed until 6–8 weeks post-surgery, whereas with use of BMP-2 complete bone bridging is observed approximately 2 weeks post-surgery <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref> and remodeling phases are typically complete by about 12 weeks post-surgery. It was therefore hoped that a 4 week time point would capture the active callus formation phase of bone healing. Further, both male and female mice as well as different ages of mice would be used if not for inherent spaceflight constraints. Moreover, surgeries would be completed in spaceflight as compared to on Earth so that the entire healing process would occur in space.</p>
                <p id="p0220">With regard to the selection of the SBD healing model, because an important goal of ongoing investigations is to determine what therapeutics could be used to improve bone healing in humans during longer-term space stays, a SBD healing model which allowed for local delivery of drugs to the fracture site was used. This model was further selected because of its many clinically relevant features (e.g. use of the same type of collagen sponge used to deliver BMP-2 to human patients, use of hollow rods, implantation of the collagen sponge at the time of surgical stabilization), the reproducibility of the fracture pattern, and the reduction in soft tissue injury compared to the crush injury experienced to the quadriceps when using the closed Einhorn fracture model <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, there are many disadvantages to the use of this model, compared to a more traditional closed model such as the Einhorn fracture model. An important limitation in this control study, where drugs such as BMP-2 were not administered, is that as observed in <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, limited callus formation was observed which decreased the amount of callus available for use in our omics analyses. The use of the scaffold adds another confounding variable to our omics analyses as does the use of the collagen sponge.</p>
                <p id="p0225">Limitations aside, our genome-to-phenome integrative approach suggested spaceflight as a highly unfavorable environment for fracture healing. The recruitment of regeneration-critical cellular and molecular agents at the wound site was potentially interrupted in spaceflight. The inhibited NF-κB signal potentially facilitated dual adverse functions, namely promoting apoptosis and impeding cell migration <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. This node could be an ideal target for precision medicine approaches, but a delicate balance is required to achieve maximum benefit, since NF-κB is a ubiquitous regulator of transcription.</p>
