                <p id="Par1">Crystallization processes have been widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for the manufacture, storage, and delivery of small-molecule and small protein therapeutics. However, the identification of crystallization processes for biologics, particularly monoclonal antibodies, has been prohibitive due to the size and the flexibility of their overall structure. There remains a challenge and an opportunity to utilize the benefits of crystallization of biologics. The research laboratories of Merck Sharp &amp; Dome Corp. (MSD) in collaboration with the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory performed crystallization experiments with pembrolizumab (Keytruda<sup>Â®</sup>) on the SpaceX-Commercial Resupply Services-10 mission to the ISS. By leveraging microgravity effects such as reduced sedimentation and minimal convection currents, conditions producing crystalline suspensions of homogeneous monomodal particle size distribution (39âÎ¼m) in high yield were identified. In contrast, the control ground experiments produced crystalline suspensions with a heterogeneous bimodal distribution of 13 and 102âÎ¼m particles. In addition, the flight crystalline suspensions were less viscous and sedimented more uniformly than the comparable ground-based crystalline suspensions. These results have been applied to the production of crystalline suspensions on earth, using rotational mixers to reduce sedimentation and temperature gradients to induce and control crystallization. Using these techniques, we have been able to produce uniform crystalline suspensions (1â5âÎ¼m) with acceptable viscosity (&lt;12âcP), rheological, and syringeability properties suitable for the preparation of an injectable formulation. The results of these studies may help widen the drug delivery options to improve the safety, adherence, and quality of life for patients and caregivers.</p>

              <title>Introdution</title>
              <p id="Par2">Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics have made a major impact on treating oncological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurological diseases and disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Currently, there are over 70 therapeutic mAbs marketed in the United States and Europe. Given the increasing use of mAb therapeutics, it is becoming evident that there is a need for improvements in the manufacture, delivery, and storage of mAbs. From a manufacturing point of view, mAb drugs are complicated to make and usually purified by multiple chromatographic steps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> The final formulations require refrigeration and have limited shelf lives, impacting the overall cost of the treatment. Small-molecule drugs and peptide therapeutics like insulin are often purified and formulated for oral or parenteral administration using crystallization processes. These processes have been shown to reduce production cost as well as improve the overall quality and shelf life of the final formulations. Insulin crystallization, for example, has been used for over 60 years in manufacturing and delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> On the other hand, for larger proteins, crystallization has been used primarily for structure determination using X-ray crystallography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and the methodology has focused solely on the production of large, single, and highly ordered crystals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> While there is ongoing research into the application of crystallization for bioseparations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> as well as technology for large-scale crystallization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> examples of protein crystallization processes for large-scale manufacturing applications are very limited.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Prior to final formulation (drug product), the mAb drug substance (active pharmaceutical ingredient) must be stored and/or shipped to worldwide sites. Often the drug substance is stored as frozen diluted solutions or frozen lyophilized powders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> For areas of the world where refrigeration is limited, a product that is stable and can be reformulated at room temperature would be highly desirable; stable crystalline drug substances could be the answer.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Today, typical mAbs are administered as intravenous (IV) infusions in hospital settings, which impacts the quality of life for patients and the caregivers. The overall process may require patients to take days off to travel far distances for hospital care, which may also expose them to infections, and impacts caregivers who are accompanying them for their scheduled infusions. The IV infusion process entails a saline wash step, the mAb formulation infusion step, and followed by a final saline wash step. The overall procedure takes multiple hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Additionally, a large subset of patients requiring mAb therapy cannot physically support IV infusions due to their vascular condition. They require a surgically implanted, subcutaneous (SC) port. A septum containing catheter connects the port to a vein through which drugs can be injected. The scheduling and implantation of the port often delays mAb therapy and increases the risk of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> For this reason, there is ongoing research into the development of highly concentrated mAb formulations for SC injection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> administered at a local doctorâs office requiring less frequent dosing. A typical therapeutic dose can be in the 150â200âmg range. Most mAbs have limited solubility and the viscosity of the solution has been shown to increase dramatically above 100âmg/ml concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> A preferred SC formulation would be a 150â200âmg dose in a 1âml volume. One potential advantage of using crystalline formulations is that they are often less viscous than the comparably concentrated solution formulations. For example, crystalline suspensions of mAbs such as Infliximab at 150âmg/ml have an acceptable viscosity value of 26âcP vs. an unacceptable 275âcP at the comparable solution concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> There is limited information on the side effects or pathology of SC delivery of mAbs. However, a histochemistry study in mice was performed with crystalline trastuzumab, where no observed inflammation at the injection site nor any abnormalities in tissue samples was observed as compared to control tissue within normal limits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par5">For these reasons, the use of crystallization processes for purification, drug delivery, and storage of mAbs is being investigated using Pembrolizumab (Keytruda<sup>Â®</sup>). Keytruda<sup>Â®</sup> is an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the bodyâs immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Keytruda<sup>Â®</sup> is a humanized mAb that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes.

A batch crystallization method was devised using 50âmM HEPES, pH 7.7, 100âmM caffeine, 10.8% PEG 3350, and the pembrolizumab concentration was varied between 20 and 40âmg/ml; a temperature ramp (4â30âÂ°C over 48âh) was used to induce crystallization. The size of these experiments (1âml bottles) was chosen to produce enough crystalline suspension for characterization using standard methods to identify crystals and analyze their rheological behavior and bioactivity.

                <title>Application to laboratory crystallization processes</title>
                <p id="Par18">At least 48 variables have been identified, which affect protein crystal growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> For the pembrolizumab crystallization condition investigated, sedimentation and temperature were identified as key variables in microgravity crystal growth. Experiments were devised to explore if these effects could improve crystal growth on earth. To minimize sedimentation a digital bottle roller with slow and horizonal rotation set at 24âr.p.m. (Labnet Hybridization Oven) was utilized. This method allowed the microcrystals, which contain 50â70% water, to remain buoyant during the process, thereby reducing sedimentation. This rotation speed was identified by visual observation of the experiment: at slower rotation rates, crystalline particles were observed to sediment during crystallization; at higher revolutions, the crystalline particles pelleted on the walls of the crystallization vessel. At the 1âml scale, batch crystallization experiments carried out using a 4â22âÂ°C temperature gradient over 24âh to induce crystallization and the digital bottle roller resulted in uniform crystalline suspensions with a geometric mean of 1.4âÂ±â1.7âÎ¼m; under identical but static (no rotation) conditions, the crystalline suspension had a more diverse particle size distribution with a geometric mean size of 4.7âÂ±â10.5âÎ¼m. The use of vertical rotation in the same Labnet hybridization oven resulted in less uniform particle size distributions using the 4â22âÂ°C temperature gradient over 24âh.</p>
                <p id="Par19">To test the effect that the temperature gradients may have on the particle size distribution, we attempted to extend the temperature gradient over a period longer than 24âh, without using any rotation. However, using the 4â30âÂ°C gradient over 24âh, there was no improvement on the particle size distribution observed, possibly due to agglomeration effects as a result of sedimentation. However, we observed that using an inverted temperature gradient, especially a 50 to 22âÂ°C decrease over 24âh, resulted in more uniform crystalline suspensions with a geometric mean particle size of 1.3âÂ±â0.5âÎ¼m. These results suggest that crystallization of temperature-sensitive proteins could benefit in utilizing a temperature gradient-based strategy to improve crystal nucleation and growth behavior, which is not usually considered in protein crystallization studies.

              <p id="Par21">The goal of this project was to understand which variables could affect mAb crystallization, using microgravity experiments as a research tool to identify better conditions for pembrolizumab crystallization. These microgravity experiments enabled the identification of sedimentation and temperature gradients as key variables to control crystal nucleation and growth for producing uniform crystalline pembrolizumab suspensions. These effects were tested and confirmed using standard laboratory ware. These results were consistent with earlier microgravity crystallization experiments with Î±-interferon where uniform particle size distributions were produced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par22">The observed narrow particle size distribution in the flight experiment appears to be a consequence of a combination of minimal sedimentation and convection effects, resulting in a single nucleation and growth event with desirable viscosity and rheological properties.</p>
              <p id="Par23">There are several challenges of performing microgravity research, including adapting earth processes to flight-certified hardware, experimental timelines (setup and recovery), and real-time analysis. These factors can usually be easily addressed in earth experiments. However, designing and planning microgravity experiments forces more critical evaluation of factors not normally accounted for in earth experiments Nevertheless, microgravity research offers researchers an opportunity to generate materials distinct from classical earth-based experiments and provide unexpected results that can change the design and planning of earth-based experiments and processes.</p>
              <p id="Par24">Up to now, microgravity research has been severely limited by the available technology: for example, the only existing flight hardware for protein crystal growth is the one designed in the space shuttle era for the growth of relatively large single crystals for neutron and X-ray crystallographic structure determination studies rather than for crystalline suspensions. The hardware only allows for âblack boxâ experiments, which require setup several days prior to activation, allow for analysis only upon recovery, and provide no opportunity to continuously monitor the experiments or to do iterative experiments during flight. In addition, there has been limited information on fluid dynamics and properties under microgravity conditions. To address this issue, a novel experiment was performed by NASA astronaut Kate Rubins during her 2016 mission to the ISS, demonstrating that liquid handling operations can be carried out in space using standard laboratory containers and procedures comparable to earth processes. The availability of specifically designed three-dimensional printed lab equipment (hardware) can also greatly enhance the rate of space research. Ideally, this could lead to the establishment of a dedicated laboratory area within the space station, where multiple experiments and analyses can be performed using standard scientific instrumentation. Most importantly, direct involvement of scientist-astronauts in experimental design, execution, and analyses provides the opportunity to perform experiments in real time and with immediate data transfer to researchers on the ground. Collaboration and interactivity are key to quickly understand the issues and tailor the experiments to the specific situation, which will not only provide new scientific insights but will allow advancing of microgravity research.</p>

Using the protein content determined by amino acid analysis, a molar absorptivity (extinction coefficient) of 209,155âÂ±â879âM<sup>â1</sup>âcm<sup>â1</sup> at 278ânm was determined, which corresponds to an absorptivity of 1.43âÂ±â0.006âl/(gâcm). This value was used for standard pembrolizumab samples. Whole contents from a representative bottle from each stack of identical experiments were centrifuged using low-speed centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was removed by aspiration. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 20âmM histidine buffer, pH 5.4, and then dialyzed vs. 20âmM histidine buffer pH 5.4 (three times). The resulting dialysate was centrifuged to remove particulates.</p>

                <title>Bioassay (HH-PCF experiments)</title>
                <p id="Par30">The pembrolizumab competitive binding ELISA evaluates the ability of pembrolizumab to compete with PD-L1 ligand for binding to PD-1/Fc immobilized on an ELISA plate. The pembrolizumab reference material and test samples (space samples) were serially diluted and mixed with an equal volume of rhB7-H1/Fc chimera (PDL-1) dilution before transfer to ELISA plates. The levels of PD-L1 bound to PD-1/Fc were detected by biotinylated anti-PDL-1, following conjugation with streptavidin and chemiluminescence substrate. Luminescence was measured using a microplate reader and the resulting inhibition response curves were analyzed with the curve fitting software (e.g., SoftMax Pro). The IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values generated from this assay are a measurement of the ability of pembrolizumab to inhibit PD-L1 binding to PD-1/Fc. Biological potency is expressed as % relative potency of pembrolizumab reference material. Geometric mean of relative potency from multiple replicates (<italic>N</italic>â=â3) of the same sample is reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> with %GSD and 95% confidence interval.</p>

The protein concentration of the resulting concentrated suspensions from both the flight and ground experiments were measured based on dissolution of a 10âÎ¼l aliquot in 1âml normal saline phosphate buffer (ground; 140âmg/ml, 0.5âml sample; flight; 138âmg/ml, 0.5âml sample). Samples for dynamic viscosity measurements were prepared by dilution of the stock solution to 50 and 75âmg/ml using 20âmM HEPES buffer, pH 6.8, 10% PEG 3350 for both the concentrated ground and flight samples. A Rheosense m-VROC<sup>TM</sup> instrument was utilized derives viscosity from the pressure drop using the HagenâPoiseuille equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> Shear sweeps were performed from 1500 to 95,000 (1/s) to measure the dynamic viscosity. The viscosity of 50 and 75âmg/ml crystalline pembrolizumab suspensions from both flight and ground samples were measured and plotted vs. different shear rates using a BD Hypak 1âml pre-filled syringe with a 27 gauge regular wall (RW) with a 1/2âin. needle.

All hardware was filled at the Space Life Sciences Lab (SLSL). The hardware was integrated and transferred to a +4âÂ°C incubator. The flight hardware was turned over to Cold Stowage on 16 February 2017 and loaded into the Polar incubator on the same day. The ground control hardware was maintained in a +4âÂ°C incubator at the SLSL. The MSD PCG (CASIS PCG-5) payload was launched on 19 February 2017 on SpaceX-10 and was transferred to the ISS-NL on 21 February 2017. It was transferred to a MERLIN at +4âÂ°C for 24âh before starting the temperature ramp up. The MERLIN temperature reached +30âÂ°C at 12:30âp.m. EST on 27 February 2017. Ground control hardware remained in an SLSL incubator at +4âÂ°C and the same incubator was used for ground control temperature ramp up on the same schedule used for the MERLIN. On 17 March 2017, the Flight HD-PCG removal from the MERLIN and transfer to a Cargo Transfer Bag was completed at 3:22âp.m. EST. The Ground control hardware transferred to ambient at 3:28âp.m. EST. Following SpaceX-10 splashdown in the Pacific Ocean on 19 March 2017, the MSD PCG-5 hardware was transferred to the Long Beach Airport on 20th March. The hardware was received by MSD from NASA. The flight hardware was hand-carried from Los Angeles to Orlando on 21st March. The ground control hardware was transferred at the Orlando airport and continued to New Jersey, arriving in the evening of 21st March. There were no pre-flight, in-flight, or post-flight anomalies.</p>
