                <p>Rapidly evolving space exploration makes understanding the short- and long- term effects of microgravity on humans, plants, and microorganisms an important task. The ubiquitous presence of the gravitational force has had an influence on the development of all living entities on Earth, and short- and long-term changes in perceived gravitational force can induce notable changes within cells. <italic toggle="yes">Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> is the Gram-positive bacterium that is best known for its extreme resistance to UV-C and gamma radiation, oxidation stress, and desiccation. Thus increased interest has been placed on this species in the context of space research. The present study aims to elucidate the short-term proteomic response of this species to real microgravity during parabolic flight. Overnight cultures of <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> were subjected to microgravity during a single parabola, and metabolic activity was quenched using methanol. Proteins were extracted and subsequently measured using HPLC nESI MS/MS. The results, such as the enrichment of the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway with differentially abundant proteins and altered S-layer protein abundance, suggested molecular rearrangements in the cell envelope of <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic>. Altered abundance of proteins involved in energy metabolism and DNA repair could be linked with increased endogenous ROS production that contributes to the stress response. Moreover, changes in protein abundance in response to microgravity show similarities with previously reported stress responses. Thus, the present results could be used to further investigate the complex regulation of the remarkable stress management of this bacterium.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>As plans for future space exploration are becoming more ambitious, a better understanding of all factors affecting humans, plants, and microorganisms in space is necessary. Microgravity is an important variable in outer space and understanding the short- and long- term effects of microgravity on cellular processes will be important to minimize its negative effects on the physiology of any organism. To that end, outer space has become a coveted environment to investigate how microgravity affects living organisms. The International Space Station (ISS), orbiting in low Earth orbit (LEO) at an average altitude of 400 km, has been the location for multiple experiments aiming to simulate extra-terrestrial conditions, including microgravity [<xref rid="B1-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The intensity of the gravitational pull experienced by every object on Earth is inversely proportionate to the square of the distance between the centre of the Earth and the centre of the object. On Earth, this acceleration force is approximately 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> (= 1 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>), whereas in LEO this force is diminished to 10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>−6</sup> <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> [<xref rid="B6-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To mimic these diminished forces, various ground-based approaches have also been developed that place an object in a simulated or real <italic toggle="yes">free fall</italic> state without leaving Earth’s atmosphere. Simulated microgravity is commonly achieved with three methods: 2-D clinostats, random positioning machines (RPM), and diamagnetic levitation, each attempting to negate the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Earth [<xref rid="B7-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Real microgravity is usually achieved using three methods: drop towers, sounding rockets, and parabolic flight [<xref rid="B7-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>The ubiquitous presence of the gravitational force has had an influence on the development of all living entities on Earth, and short- and long-term changes in perceived gravitational force can induce notable changes in living organisms. High importance has been attributed to investigating responses in plants and microorganisms due to their potential role as oxygen and food sources during future space missions. Plants exhibit substantial responses to changes in gravitational forces. Exposed to short-term microgravity during parabolic flight, <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> cells react by up-regulating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-related and Ca<sup>2+</sup> -related proteins [<xref rid="B13-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and similar results were also reported during simulated microgravity experiments [<xref rid="B14-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, simulated and real microgravity experiments showed that microgravity induces changes in <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> protein synthesis (decrease), general stress response (increase), cell wall biosynthesis (increase), and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as signalling (decrease) and intra-cellular transport (increase) [<xref rid="B15-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The effect of changes in gravitational acceleration has also been investigated in microorganisms. The photosynthesizing unicellular flagellate <italic toggle="yes">Euglena gracilis</italic>, subjected to microgravity during parabolic flight, responds similarly to <italic toggle="yes">A. thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="B17-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In prokaryotes, multiple studies in real and simulated microgravity have been conducted to investigate the molecular response of various species. Studies show that despite their phylogenetic proximity, bacterial species can exhibit varying changes in virulence. <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> have been shown to become more virulent in microgravity [<xref rid="B2-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B18-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas under simulated microgravity <italic toggle="yes">Yersinia pestis</italic> showed decreased secretion of T3SS effector proteins, which are necessary for peak virulence [<xref rid="B19-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, Su et al. [<xref rid="B20-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus cereus</italic> experience significant changes in their proteome after spaceflight. Overall, studies show that even closely related microorganisms exhibit a varied response to real and simulated microgravity, and only limited evidence exists supporting conserved molecular regulators [<xref rid="B2-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B18-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p>
              <p><italic toggle="yes">Deinococcus radiodurans</italic> is the Gram-positive bacterium that is best known for its extreme resistance to UV-C and gamma radiation, oxidation stress, and desiccation [<xref rid="B21-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These extreme survival abilities have garnered interest in this species in the context of space research. Recently, <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> survived interplanetary transfer during three years of exposure to outer space [<xref rid="B24-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our subsequent multi-omics study on <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> exposed outside the ISS in the framework of the Tanpopo orbital mission provided evidence for a multifaceted stress response to 1 year of space exposure [<xref rid="B25-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We have also conducted simulated microgravity experiments on <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> using 2-D clinostats to investigate this species’ specific response to long-term changes in gravitational forces [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Under simulated microgravity conditions, this bacterium upregulates proteins involved in DNA stress response, carbohydrate degradation, and general gene regulation (DR_1174, DR_2299, DR_0750, DR_2419). <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> also exhibits decreased abundance of ribosomal proteins in response to microgravity, as observed in other bacterial species [<xref rid="B27-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The study by Ott et al. [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] delivered a good overview of the long-term changes occurring in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> due to simulated microgravity, however, it is unclear how the sheer stress and fluid convection associated with this method contributed to these changes and what the short-term effects of microgravity on this bacterium are.</p>
              <p>In the present study, parabolic flight was used to subject microbiological samples to real microgravity. <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> cells were subjected to microgravity and increased gravity during parabolic flight, and their proteome was subsequently analysed with high-performance liquid chromatography/nano-electrospray ionization in tandem with mass spectrometry (HPLC/nESI-MS/MS). Overall, the aim of this study was to elucidate the changes to the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> proteome that occur after exposure to short-term real microgravity and increased gravity aboard parabolic flight and to compare this response to the response previously reported in the literature. This study can contribute to understanding how cells react to reduced gravity immediately after exposure without other, more influential environmental factors present in low Earth orbit.</p>

On the day of the parabolic flight, overnight cultures were transferred into 12 syringes (2 mL of culture per syringe) belonging to the top part of the custom injection device (<xref rid="app1-life-12-00023" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>). Falcon tubes, where cultures were to be injected, were filled with 10 mL of 100% methanol (MeOH). </p>

TRIzol was added to the pellet and the pellet was further homogenized in a bead beater (30 s, 6.5 m/s).

After the acetone wash, the pellets were air-dried. A total of 60 μg of protein from each sample was used for digestion. For the reduction step, samples were adjusted to 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C at 700 rpm. Samples were then alkylated by adjusting the iodoacetamide (IAA) concentration to 10 mM then incubated for 60 min in darkness at RT at 700 rpm. Alkylation was stopped by adjusting the DTT concentration to 10 mM DTT. Samples were incubated for 15 min at RT. Three microliters of trypsin beads (Promega) were added to digest proteins, and samples were incubated at 37 °C at 10 rpm for 16 h. Digestion was halted by placing samples on ice, followed by desalting and a protein quantification procedure as described in Ott et al. [<xref rid="B29-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

                <p>A total of 1925 proteins were identified in at least one replicate, which represents 61.7% of the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> genome. Three treatment groups of four replicates were present. These treatment groups represented the gravity state in which the cells were placed: 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (microgravity), flight control (FC; increased gravity), and ground control (GC; control). Data was filtered to a maximum of 1 missing value in the treatment group (at least 3/4 numerical values in each 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>, FC, and GC), which decreased the number of proteins for analysis from 1925 to 1200. PCA plots, created with the DEP PCA tool, showed that sample GC_4 was an important driver for PC2, which represented the within-group separation and decreased between-group separation in PC1 (<xref rid="app1-life-12-00023" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>). Based on these QC results, sample GC_4 was removed from further analysis. QC plots obtained with the built-in DEP tools showed no additional issues. After removal, imputation of remaining missing values was performed with QRILC with 10.4% (125/1200) of values being imputed. PCA of the 1200 proteins showed clear separation between the microgravity and other groups in PC1, explaining 46.9% of variation (<xref rid="app1-life-12-00023" ref-type="app">Figure S3</xref>). Statistical analysis with the DEP pipeline showed 711 (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) differentially abundant proteins between cells subjected to microgravity (0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) and ground control (GC).

                <p>General metabolism was the largest group in proteins with both increased and decreased abundance. For proteins with increased abundance, general metabolism contained 137 proteins involved in various biosynthetic, as well as metabolic and catabolic, processes, such as arginine biosynthesis (KEGG dra00220); purine metabolism (KEGG dra00230); valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis (KEGG dra00290) and degradation (KEGG dra00280); and starch and sucrose metabolism (KEGG dra00500). Apart from this, proteins with increased abundance are involved in amino acid biosynthesis and iron–sulfur cluster assembly. For decreased abundance proteins, many pathways with a broad function are found, such as purine metabolism (dra00230) and carbon metabolism (dra01200). Additionally, some pathways overlap with the general metabolism pathways enriched by proteins with increased abundance, such as fatty acid biosynthesis (dra00061) and fatty acid metabolism (dra01212).

As shown in <xref rid="life-12-00023-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, transport proteins represent the largest part of the increased abundance proteins in this cluster (21 out of 30 proteins), and their functions involve protein/peptide (10 proteins), ion (7 proteins), amino acid (1 protein), carbohydrate (1 protein), lipid (1 protein), and hemin transport (1 protein).

Transport proteins also constitute the largest proportion (28 out of 43 proteins), showing a decrease in protein/peptide (6 proteins), carbohydrate (1 protein), hemin (1 protein), ion (5 proteins), and iron (2 proteins) transporters. Notably, seven amino acid transporters show a significant decrease in abundance compared to GC, whereas only one amino acid transporter is significantly increased in abundance. The exact function of the five transport proteins (<xref rid="life-12-00023-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, “Other Transport function”) is unknown.

                <p>The largest proportion of the proteins of <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> with significantly changed abundance were clustered in the <italic toggle="yes">general metabolism</italic> group, which incorporates proteins that have functions in the metabolism and catabolism of amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and other metabolites as well as energy (ATP) production. Multiple KEGG pathways were significantly enriched with proteins from the <italic toggle="yes">general metabolism</italic> cluster. Some broad pathways, such as “carbon metabolism (dra01200)”, “biosynthesis of antibiotics (dra01130)”, and “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (dra01110)” were significantly enriched with proteins with significantly increased abundance. Several more specific pathways were also significantly enriched and could offer an insight into the specific processes involved in the immediate response to microgravity. Many of the pathways enriched with proteins with significantly increased abundance are involved in energy metabolism, such as “citrate cycle” (TCA cycle) (dra00020) and “pentose phosphate pathway” (dra00030). These results align very well with previously reported <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> responses to oxidative stress, as summarized in the comprehensive review by [<xref rid="B22-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has been shown that <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> utilizes proteolysis as the main energy source to obtain amino acids that are the preferred carbon source in these bacteria [<xref rid="B47-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The present results also show many increased abundance proteins in the <italic toggle="yes">general metabolism</italic> cluster to be involved in amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. Previous studies have suggested that a microgravity environment lacks the same physical forces as 1g gravity, which reduces metabolite exchange with the cell, limiting the exchange to diffusive processes [<xref rid="B48-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This state has been shown to result in the overexpression of genes related to starvation and energy demand [<xref rid="B50-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and the present results could reflect an increased energy requirement due to changes in gravity-controlled physical forces. In addition, stress induced by ionizing radiation has been shown to induce proteolytic activity inside these bacteria and is thought to be a way to decrease the biosynthetic (thus energy) requirements during post-irradiation recovery [<xref rid="B51-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. It is also believed that <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> imports degraded proteins from the extracellular milieu to aid in recovery, which could be mediated by secreted subtilisin-like serine proteases and increased protein/peptide/amino acid transport across the membrane [<xref rid="B51-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the present research, various protein-folding proteins as well as membrane proteins involved in protein/peptide import and other macromolecule import are increased in abundance (<xref rid="life-12-00023-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="life-12-00023-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among those are chaperone ClpB, GrpE, and Lon proteases. Clp family proteases and chaperones are important components of the general stress response in bacteria, preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, and degrading misfolded proteins [<xref rid="B46-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B53-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Lon proteases have been linked with the general stress response in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic>, increasing in abundance in severe stress conditions [<xref rid="B30-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. GrpE is known as a regulator of protein-folding machinery in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> [<xref rid="B22-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and likely aids in the stress response induced by microgravity. Additionally, protein DR_0456, which bears similarity to the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> exbB/tolQ family involved in biopolymer import and membrane stability [<xref rid="B54-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], is strongly induced in microgravity. Overall, these results suggest that microgravity could be causing <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> to accumulate differentially abundant proteins involved in amino acid biosynthesis, as well as protein processing, transport, and general stress response.</p>
                <p>Alongside proteolysis, glucose metabolism is also important for recovery from stress conditions as it provides metabolites that are used for DNA repair and ROS scavenging [<xref rid="B55-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) shows multiple proteins with significantly increased abundance, including G6PDH (gene name <italic toggle="yes">zwf</italic>), which is an important protein in this pathway (1.74-fold increase in microgravity). This protein has high constitutive expression, being expressed four times higher in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> than <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> under normal conditions [<xref rid="B55-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and G6PDH mutants show decreased tolerance to stressors like hydrogen peroxide and UV light [<xref rid="B56-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These results might indicate that the PPP and G6PDH plays an important role in the response to changes in gravitational forces. Additionally, <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> have been shown to modulate the activity within the TCA cycle to prioritize the glyoxylate bypass when grown in a defined minimal medium or in response to radiation [<xref rid="B51-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The glyoxylate bypass (A.K.A. glyoxylate shunt) is known to be an important modulator for the use of acetate and fatty acids in gluconeogenesis [<xref rid="B57-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, research has indicated that the glyoxylate bypass plays a role in increased virulence and resistance to oxidative stress in fungi and bacteria [<xref rid="B58-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B59-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been shown that an important source of ROS comes from the self-oxidation of respiratory chain enzymes where electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to oxygen [<xref rid="B60-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The glyoxylate bypass, seen in <xref rid="life-12-00023-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, converts isocitrate directly into glyoxylate and succinate, deprioritising two NADH producing reactions, thus potentially decreasing the amount of ROS produced [<xref rid="B51-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the present results, members of the glyoxylate bypass show significant increases in abundance, whereas the TCA cycle reactions that are deprioritized show no significant change. Thus, these results might indicate that elevated pull of the glyoxylate bypass’ enzymes could potentially help us cope with ROS during the long-term effects of exposure to microgravity.</p>

                <title>4.2. Cell Envelope Processes Are Affected by Microgravity</title>
                <p><italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic>, although staining Gram-positive [<xref rid="B61-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], has a cell envelope structure similar to that of Gram-negative bacteria: inner and outer membranes containing a layer of peptidoglycan and the periplasmic space between the two [<xref rid="B62-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The outer membrane is a mixture of lipids followed by the hexagonally packed surface layer composed of HPI (hexagonally packed intermediate-layer surface protein). This outer-most mixture of HPI, SlpA and other components is often referred to as the S-layer, and such a layer is also present in other bacterial and archaeal species [<xref rid="B64-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Previous research has shown that SlpA is of paramount importance in cell envelope integrity, and SlpA mutants showed decreased resistance to solvents and sheer stress, whereas HPI mutations had little to no impact on this aspect [<xref rid="B65-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This importance of SlpA is interpreted by Misra et al. [<xref rid="B66-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], who, based on their results, proposed that SlpA attaches to HPI on one end and to the peptidoglycan layer on the other, providing a structural role and actually making up most of the periplasmic space. A recent study by Farci et al. [<xref rid="B67-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] showed that the actual composition of the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> S-layer might be more complicated than initially thought, consisting not only of SlpA but a range of other proteins. They also provided evidence that SlpA might be a part of a larger protein complex called S-layer deinoxanthin-binding complex (SDBC) based on observations of SlpA binding carotenoid deinoxanthin, a strong protective antioxidant [<xref rid="B68-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Upon analysis of the SDBC, it was shown that it consists of multiple proteins, namely, SlpA, DR_2310, DR_0505, DR_A0283, and DR_A0282 [<xref rid="B69-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Moreover, they hypothesised that in addition to inducing resistance to various threats, the S-layer is also involved in the exchange of compounds and molecules in and out of the cell. This is also supported by evidence showing that protein DR_0774 is involved in extra-cellular transport across the membrane and provides additional structural support to the cell envelope [<xref rid="B67-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. </p>
                <p>The results of the present study show that HPI and DR_0774 are significantly decreased in abundance. Moreover, three out of the six SDBC proteins, DR_0505, DR_A0283, DR_A0281, are also significantly decreased in abundance, whereas SlpA itself also seems to be decreased in abundance, although it is not below the significance threshold (<italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value = 0.053). The importance of the S-layer proteins on the integrity of the cell envelope make these results quite surprising, especially since a previous studies performed by Ott et al. [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrated an increase is S-layer proteins after 48h of simulated microgravity, indicating either an increase in cell envelope size or greater turnover of S-layer proteins, potentially due to damage. It is possible that microgravity initially induces degradation of the S-layer proteins, which might later on trigger an upregulation of S-layer protein expression, thus explaining the discrepancy between the short-term exposure and prolonged exposure to microgravity. The present results show that proteins involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, such as murB, murD, murE, and murF, show significant increases in abundance (<xref rid="life-12-00023-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, proteins involved in the synthesis of precursors previously shown to be important for peptidoglycan synthesis are also increased in abundance, such as murI (glutamate racemase) [<xref rid="B70-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
                <p>In addition to an upregulation of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway components, the present results also show an increased abundance of the protein export (Sec) pathway members. This pathway is the central and essential conserved pathway that is responsible for the export of proteins through the (inner) plasma membrane in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [<xref rid="B71-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Proteins secreted through this pathway can either stay membrane-bound or be secreted to the opposite side of the membrane. Additionally, proteins exported through this pathway can be attached to peptidoglycan, thus this pathway is also involved in the localization of S-layer proteins [<xref rid="B72-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The Sec pathway is discussed in detail in the review by Tsirigotaki et al. [<xref rid="B71-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], but briefly summarized herein. Protein export, through this pathway, is conducted in three steps: sorting and targeting, translocation, and maturation and release. Pre-proteins translated in the cytoplasm are targeted to the membrane channel SecYEG by either ffh and its membrane receptor ftsY, or SecA. The protein is translocated through the membrane via the SecYEG channel fuelled by repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis by SecA, and the proton motive force. Signal peptidases (such as DR_1427) process the protein and it is then released on the other side of the membrane. All these essential components are increased in abundance in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> cells subjected to microgravity (<xref rid="life-12-00023-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, marked with asterisk), which could imply a potential to increase transmembrane transport during further prolonged response to microgravity.</p>
                <p>Another aspect of the results, namely the <italic toggle="yes">tRNA</italic> cluster, could provide further evidence that changes in the cell envelope are being induced by the onset of microgravity. Fifteen out of the 17 proteins in the tRNA cluster are part of the “aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway (dra00970)”. Aminoacyl-tRNAs (AA-tRNA) are best known for their role in protein synthesis, where AA-tRNAs deliver amino acids to the ribosomes during the mRNA translation process [<xref rid="B73-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, they have also been shown to be involved in general stress response by attaching amino acids to damaged proteins, thus tagging them for degradation [<xref rid="B74-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Moreover, AA-tRNAs have been linked with peptidoglycan biosynthesis and lipid membrane transformations and have been directly linked with increased antibiotic resistance in microorganisms (as reviewed in [<xref rid="B76-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,<xref rid="B77-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]). Additionally, the decrease in abundance of ribosomal proteins further suggests that AA-tRNAs might be directed away from their translation function. AA-tRNA upregulation has previously been observed in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> cells subjected to a simulated space vacuum [<xref rid="B30-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which could indicate a similar response onset. </p>
                <p>Overall, our results suggest that the cell envelope is being affected by changes in gravity: enrichment of peptidoglycan synthesis pathway, increase in AA-tRNA abundance, decrease in S-layer protein abundance, and increase in sec pathway protein abundance. To elaborate these results further, thorough comprehensive analysis of <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> S-layer is necessary. For instance, subjecting cells to stress stimulus at different time points and employing methods other than -omics techniques, such as structural analysis. Interestingly, it appears that <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> responds to changes in gravitational force with the accumulation of several sensory structures that can further induce major changes in cellular metabolism. The protein DR_A0204 (response regulator) is a part of the two-component signal transduction system (TCS) and shows a 2.5-fold increased abundance in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. Proteins in the TCS have been linked to regulation of cell cycle, biofilm formation, and virulence in some bacteria [<xref rid="B78-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and thus could be used by <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> to sense external stress factors. Another protein involved in cell signalling is DR_A0352 (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP)), which is increased in abundance 4.22-fold in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. MCPs are the main chemoreceptor family in bacteria [<xref rid="B80-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and are involved in a variety of functions in different species, such as biofilm formation [<xref rid="B81-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and exopolysaccharide [<xref rid="B82-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and toxin production [<xref rid="B83-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Due to their wide array of potential functions, this <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> MCP could be involved in responding to extracellular stress caused by microgravity. However, further investigation is necessary to understand its exact function.</p>
                <p>Based on the results presented here and published earlier by Ott et al. [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it is possible to develop a hypothesis as to how <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> regulates its cell envelope remodeling under microgravity conditions. Previous studies have shown that many bacterial species become more resistant to extracellular stressors by increasing cell aggregation and biofilm production when subjected to real or simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B84-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,<xref rid="B85-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> is not known to form biofilms in its natural environment, although mutant strains have shown this ability [<xref rid="B87-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is possible that <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> also possesses similar mechanisms in response to stress by modulating the thickness of the protective cell envelope. While results after 48 h of microgravity show an increase in S-layer proteins, the immediate response to microgravity presented here shows a decrease in the same proteins. This can possibly be explained by remodeling of cell envelopes and addition of newly synthesized S-layer proteins after long term exposure to microgravity. Bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis has been shown to require removal of “old” glycan chains to synthesize new chains [<xref rid="B88-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This could support the hypothesis that expansion of the peptidoglycan layer and subsequently the other cell envelope components cannot occur before some of the anchored S-layer proteins are removed together with the “old” peptidoglycan. After increasing the surface area and/or thickness of the peptidoglycan layer, the S-layer proteins are freshly secreted in larger numbers to match the increased volume/area and would also align well with the results from the simulated microgravity study (hypothesis visualized in <xref rid="life-12-00023-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This hypothesis could be tested by performing a similar parabolic flight experiment but with more parabolas and timepoints, thus generating a timeline of protein changes. If S-layer proteins do follow a decrease-then-increase pattern, it could provide evidence in favor of this hypothesis.</p>

                <title>4.3. Does Microgravity Induce DNA Repair?</title>
                <p>The presence of the <italic toggle="yes">DNA damage and repair and DNA processing</italic> cluster in the present results might elicit curiosity since one does not immediately correlate seconds in free fall with damage to DNA. Previous studies, however, have indeed shown a link between microgravity and DNA damage during ground-based microgravity experiments. Simulated microgravity experiments on human retinal pigment epithelial cells induced DNA single stand breaks after 48 h [<xref rid="B89-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Human bed rest studies, which are used to simulate microgravity on humans, showed an increase in an oxidative DNA damage marker after 60 days [<xref rid="B90-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Moreover, the simulated microgravity study performed on <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> by Ott et al. [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also showed an increase in DNA repair machinery, suggesting damage to DNA after 48h in a clinostat. Thus, this shows that microgravity alone can induce DNA repair. The results here show that in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> DNA repair and stress response proteins are differentially abundant after short-term exposure to free fall. Overall, 17 proteins showed significant increases in abundance in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> compared to GC. DNA-directed polymerase (DR_1707 or PolA) and DNA ligase (DR_2069 or LigA) show an increase of more than twofold and exonuclease ABC subunit B (DR_2275 or UvrB) and transcription-repair coupling factor (DR_1532 or Mfd) show an increase of 1.7-fold and 1.59-fold, respectively. These four proteins are part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (dra03420), which is responsible for the recognition and repair of DNA lesions that can be caused by chemicals, radiation, and ROS [<xref rid="B91-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Three of these proteins (excluding UvrB) were also increased after 48h in simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Other proteins that have previously been implicated in DNA repair in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> are significantly increased in abundance, such as RecA, which has a role in genome reconstitution after severe damage [<xref rid="B92-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Interestingly, a decrease in abundance of some proteins involved in DNA repair and processing was also noted. The protein with the most decreased abundance is the extracellular nuclease (DR_B0067), which is the only extracellular nuclease encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> genome [<xref rid="B93-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In their study, Li et al. [<xref rid="B93-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] investigated this nuclease and showed that DR_B0067 mutants had impaired resistance to hydrogen peroxide and that this protein played an important role in oxidative stress resistance by breaking down extracellular DNA. As shown previously, nucleosides and bases can protect proteins from ROS-induced damage [<xref rid="B94-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], thus this degradation of DNA would then provide more nucleosides and more ROS protection [<xref rid="B93-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Therefore, it is rather unclear why this protein would decrease in abundance. It could possibly be explained by the absence of extracellular DNA; however, this cannot be confirmed due to a lack of data. Therefore, future studies should investigate the specific triggers of DR_B0067 altered abundance in microgravity. </p>
                <p>The <italic toggle="yes">transcription</italic> cluster of proteins also shows that the pull of DNA repair enzymatic activities is enriched, potentially preparing for a long-term molecular response. The protein with the highest increase in abundance in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> in this category was hypothetical protein DR_1872. There is no experimental information about its function besides its GO BP term and 100% identity to a <italic toggle="yes">Deinococcus wulumuqiensis</italic> transcriptional regulator. However, it showed a 3.88-fold increase in abundance in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> compared to GC. Thus, DR_1872 is potentially a good target for future investigations into short-term responses to microgravity in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic>. Among the other proteins with significantly increased abundance, three out of four subunits of RNA polymerase (RNAP) are present. RNA polymerase is a protein complex involved in the synthesis of messenger RNA and non-coding RNA from the DNA template strand. Additionally, transcription factor Rho and transcription termination/antitermination protein NusA show increased abundance in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. In bacteria, these proteins are all linked by the transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). TCR is a DNA repair mechanism that is present in prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes [<xref rid="B95-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In TCR, RNAP elongating RNA stops at DNA lesions. This event recruits the NER-machinery to the DNA lesion and initiates the DNA repair process, thus RNAPs are effectively DNA damage sensors. The aforementioned Mfd removes the stalled RNAP from the lesion by pushing it forward and recruits further NER components [<xref rid="B96-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. What is more interesting, a recent study showed that transcription factor Rho might carry out a similar function to Mfd, thus further facilitating DNA repair [<xref rid="B97-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Additionally, an Mfd-independent TCR pathway has been shown to involve the NusA protein, where it works with UvrD to pull the RNAP, revealing the lesion [<xref rid="B98-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. </p>
                <p>Decreased abundance proteins in the <italic toggle="yes">Transcription</italic> cluster also show some interesting patterns. The protein with the most decreased abundance is the CSD family cold shock protein (DR_0907), showing a decrease of approximately 25-fold in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. The study by Anaganti et al. [<xref rid="B99-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] investigated the importance of DR_0907 on <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> cellular functions and found that DR_0907 mutants showed a wide variety of affected cellular functions. They showed a downregulation of proteins involved in tRNA aminoacylation, DNA metabolism, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and TCA cycle, whereas oxidative stress defence and pyrimidine ribonucleotide metabolism were upregulated. Our result might indicate an inverse link between this protein and the response to microgravity, but further investigations are necessary to understand the exact role in this response. Other decreased abundance proteins in this cluster include three TetR family transcriptional regulators. This family of transcriptional regulators is one of the largest families of transcription factors in bacteria [<xref rid="B100-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] and is generally associated with the repression of associated genes. TetR transcription factors are known to regulate efflux pump regulation, amino acid metabolism, and biofilm formation [<xref rid="B100-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. It is possible that the TetR transcription factors play an important role in the long-term <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> response to microgravity, and this role should be further investigated in future studies. <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic>’ ability to survive extreme environmental changes can possibly be explained by its high tolerance and/or resistance to DNA damage. The fast changes in DNA repair machinery abundances likely explain these traits, as an early response to mitigate DNA damage and repair it lead to higher chances of survival. Therefore, it is possible that the response observed in the <italic toggle="yes">transcription</italic> functional cluster is evidence that environmental stress leads to <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> preparing for DNA damage within seconds of onset. However, a proteomics study alone is not sufficient to determine the sequence of events leading to transcriptional regulation. Conducting a subsequent transcriptomics study on the short-term response is necessary to reveal a decrease or increase in overall transcription levels of these proteins and could provide further evidence as to which process is taking place.</p>
                <p>The present results show an increase in the TCA cycle enzymes, as well as enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref rid="life-12-00023-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A previous study on the methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> has linked increased energy metabolism, and especially upregulation of the TCA cycle, to increased production of ROS [<xref rid="B101-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In our study, an increase in the TCA cycle enzyme abundances are observed, as well as for enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref rid="life-12-00023-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, our results also indicate that the cell envelope might be subjected to additional stress, which could further destabilize the respiratory chain enzymes. This destabilization and increase in TCA cycle activity possibly leads to increased ROS production. Results also show that multiple proteins involved in protein folding and general stress response are increased in abundance (<xref rid="life-12-00023-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), potentially indicating that proteins are sustaining damage in microgravity. An increase in oxidative stress proteins from the <italic toggle="yes">stress response</italic> cluster further supports increased ROS production. Thioredoxin reductase (DR_1982) shows a 2.24-fold increase in 0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. This protein is an important antioxidant, defending DNA from oxidative damage caused by oxygen metabolism (i.e., ROS) through redox cycles involving NADPH and ROS-scavenging species [<xref rid="B102-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Moreover, it is part of the thioredoxin system and is required for the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, thus playing a role in DNA synthesis and repair [<xref rid="B103-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In this cluster, multiple proteins with oxidoreductase activity show significant increases in abundance, indicating potential destabilization of redox homeostasis. However, this cluster also contains many decreased-abundance stress response proteins with similar properties, suggesting complex oxidative stress management in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> that does not depend on one type of element.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to attribute the observed changes in protein abundance to altered gene expression, as minimal time needed for bacterial signalling, transcription, and translation significantly exceeds 10 s exposure to microgravity aboard of parabolic flight. Our presented findings on proteome changes in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> under short-term microgravity could rather be related to a difference in protein stability, protein degradation and consequentially changes in protein ratios. Protein degradation processes have been shown to be triggered by short-term microgravity in primary human macrophages aboard the ISS [<xref rid="B104-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The authors suggested ubiquitin-related protein degradation as a starting protein degradation during a stress response and the most likely source of increased amino acid levels after short-term microgravity [<xref rid="B104-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Additionally, protein degradation as a cellular stress response is known to be reflected by the microgravity-affected ubiquitin pools during parabolic rocket flights [<xref rid="B105-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Protein degradation commonly occurs as a stress response, e.g., during starvation, depletion of nutrients or in oxidative stress conditions, when reactive oxygen species damage proteins [<xref rid="B106-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Previous investigations showed that ROS production is highly dependent on changes in the gravity environment and reacts to gravitational stimuli within ~20 s of parabolic flight [<xref rid="B107-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. ROS metabolism might contribute to the regulation of protein degradation in microgravity to maintain energy homeostasis and help with nutrient utilization to rapidly adapt to the stress caused by the extraordinary circumstances. We propose that altered protein degradation could represent the underlying explanation of the observed proteomic changes in our study. This degradation process could be generated by a specific response to a different cellular environment and regulated by the general cellular protease/hydrolase system, which has been observed in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> when grown in simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B26-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, further investigations are required to better understand the gravity-sensitive nature of protein degradation and its functional mechanism. Further omics-assisted studies could elucidate whether the antibiotics as translation inhibitors can alter differential expression patterns during microgravity.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Understanding the molecular alterations occurring in bacteria due to changes in gravity is important in the context of future space missions, as microgravity is an important variable in outer space. The present study was performed to elucidate the changes to the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> proteome that occur after exposure to short-term real microgravity aboard a parabolic flight. Our investigations showed that increased gravity had no significant effect on the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> proteome, whereas 10 s in microgravity (0 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) elicited a pronounced change in multiple functional categories (summarized in <xref rid="life-12-00023-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). The results provided evidence that the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> cell envelope undergoes changes, highlighted by increased abundance of proteins involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and decreased abundance of S-layer proteins, which might indicate that microgravity induces stress to the cell envelope. The increased aminoacyl-tRNA abundance further supports this. Based on the present findings and our previous work, we hypothesized that <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> require brief degradation of ‘’old’’ peptidoglycan and S-layer proteins to generate a higher number of S-layer proteins, which are crucial in the response against environmental stress (<xref rid="life-12-00023-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). General metabolism proteins also showed differences in abundance, with increased-activity energy metabolism pathways potentially showing that increased energy is needed in response to microgravity. The elevated oxidative stress response and observed increase in abundance of DNA repair proteins might suggest that the bacterium is preparing to mitigate an increase in ROS production, potentially originating from an increase in energy metabolism and changes in the cell envelope. ROS-induced production is a well-known factor that contributes to cellular stress and degradation in astronauts during spaceflight. Recent research has been aimed at mitigating these negative effects, and proposals for the development of antioxidant cocktails have been made [<xref rid="B108-life-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. The results of the current research and the overall radiation-resistant traits of <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> suggest that this organism has an extremely rapid and efficient response to dealing with increased ROS-production. Therefore, it is possible that understanding the intricacies of this early reaction in <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> can aid in the efforts to provide a safer environment for humans in space. Overall, these results, together with those of our previous study on prolonged exposure to simulated microgravity, provide insights into the timeline of molecular changes in the <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> response to microgravity. Although our findings indicate a massive response to microgravity, further structural investigation of the cell envelope, and a targeted metabolomics study is necessary to validate the findings and elucidate the role of individual proteins in the overall response. Additionally, future experiments should focus on prolonging the microgravity duration, increasing the number of multiple time-points and flight replicates, and adding other -omics measurements, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, to obtain a comprehensive view of the molecular processes affected by microgravity. Moreover, other ground-based methods, such as drop towers or sounding rockets, could be used in the future to elucidate any potential method-specific idiosyncratic responses and further clarify the response of <italic toggle="yes">D. radiodurans</italic> to changes in gravitational acceleration.</p>
