              <abstract>
                <p>In previous studies, it has been proved that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves dyskinesia induced by conditions such as spinal cord injury, Parkinson diseases and cerebral ischemia. However, it is still unknown whether it can be used as a countermeasure for gait disorders in astronauts during space flight. In this study, we evaluated the effects of rTMS on the rat gait function under simulated microgravity (SM) conditions. The SM procedure continued for consecutive 21 days in male Wistar rats. Meanwhile, the high-frequency rTMS (10 Hz) was applied for 14 days from the eighth day of SM procedure. The behavioral results showed that SM could cause gait disorders such as decreased walking ability and contralateral limb imbalance in rats, which could be reversed by rTMS. Furthermore, rTMS affected the neural oscillations of motor cortex, enhancing in Î´ (2â4 Hz) band, suppressing in Î¸ (4â7 Hz), and Î± (7â12 Hz) bands. Additionally, rTMS could activate mTOR in the motor cortex. These data suggests that the improvement effects of rTMS on gait disorders in rats under SM conditions might be associated with its regulation on neural oscillations in the cerebral motor cortex and the expression of some motor-related proteins which may enhance the control of nervous system on muscle function. Based on our results, rTMS can be used as an potential effective supplement in the field of clinical and rehabilitation research to reduce gait disorders caused by the space environment.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Gait disorder is one of the most common motor complications in aerospace special environment, especially microgravity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bloomberg and Mulavara, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Reschke and ClÃ©ment, 2018</xref>). In this regard, the current effective measures of prevention and treatment remain to be further explored (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Hodkinson et al., 2017</xref>). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is considered to improve dyskinesia caused by diseases such as Parkinson diseases, spinal cord injury and cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arfani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Petrosyan et al., 2017</xref>), which transmits electromagnetic pulse signal through the skull to the cerebral cortex (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al., 2012</xref>) and improves the responsiveness of motor system by increasing the excitability of corticospinal system to achieve therapeutic purposes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Jooss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Khedr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The dyskinesia caused by Parkinsonâs disease and spinal cord injury is mostly due to functional deficits in cortical circuits or cerebellum, or related to the peripheral nervous systems such as impaired afferent or efferent nerves (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Ni and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Capogrosso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wirz and van Hedel, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>). However, gait disorders caused by microgravity are mostly due to muscle weakness caused by disuse atrophy and sensorimotor deconditioning caused by altered muscular sensation, which are different from the underlying causes of dyskinesia caused by the Parkinsonâs disease and spinal cord injury (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Colaianni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bettis et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is unclear whether rTMS could also improve gait disorders by enhancing the control of the neuromuscular system on hind limbs.</p>
              <p>Utilizing functional MRI investigation of brain activity, it was found that alteration of brain function in the astronaut was induced by long-duration spaceflight (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cassady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, the resting state connectivity decreases were identified for the right insula as well as between the left cerebellum and the right motor cortex (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Demertzi et al., 2016</xref>). The results from simulated weightlessness experiment on the ground for 45 days â 6Â°head down bed rest (HDBR), are consistent with the above findings (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Koppelmans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, after 70 days of HDBR, the volume of gray matter (GM) in the posterior parietal lobe was generally increased; recovery was not yet complete by 12 days post-HDBR (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Koppelmans et al., 2017</xref>). In the rodent model, 14 days of tail suspension showed that the dendritic spines in the motor cortex of the rats remodeled (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Trinel et al., 2013</xref>). Twenty-one-day simulated microgravity (SM) could reduce brain-derived neurotrophic factor and induce cerebral cortical neuron atrophy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen B. et al., 2019</xref>). These findings indicate the brain structure and function related to motor function could be affected in the real or simulated aerospace environment, including humans or rodents.</p>
              <p>As we mentioned above, rTMS has been shown to alleviate the dyskinesia of Parkinsonâs patients and the mechanism was related to regulation of neural oscillations in the cortical-basal ganglia pathway (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gaynor et al., 2008</xref>). Neural oscillations are thought to be an essential mechanism that enables the coordination of neural activity in normal brain functioning (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Fuggetta and Noh, 2013</xref>). Current research has gradually identified the basic role of abnormal neural oscillations in the delta (Î´) and theta (Î¸), and beta (Î²) and gamma (Î³) frequency ranges observed in patients to explain the pathophysiology of dyskinesia caused by neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). So we asked whether rTMS could improve the muscle control of motor cortex by regulating neural oscillations under SM conditions. This question raises profound research about the potential relationship between the effects of rTMS on the output of the motor cortex and the recovery of the controlled muscles. The goal of this study is to better understand how rTMS works, from neural oscillations to muscle control, and ultimately to apparent improvement in motor behaviors. The results will contribute to a deeper understanding of the possible electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of rTMS on the brain.</p>
              <p>In this study we found that after 2-week rTMS treatment, gait disorders caused by SM were improved to a certain extent. The mechanism was associated with the regulation of the energy distribution of different frequency bands (Î´, Î¸, and Î±) of motor cortex, as well as the activation of mTOR protein by rTMS, which could enhance the control of nervous system on hindlimb muscle, ultimately achieving the improvement in gait behaviors. This provides a theoretical basis for rTMS to improve the gait disorders and proposes new treatment idea for astronaut gait disorder caused by complex space environment.</p>

All animals were housed under normal light-dark (23Â°C, 12-h light/12-h dark cycle) with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Management Rules of the Ministry of Health of the Peopleâs Republic of China and the local Ethical Committee of the Tianjin University. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals and their suffering. Rats were randomly divided into control (CON group, <italic>n</italic> = 10), SM for 3 weeks with sham stimulation for 2 weeks (SM+sham group, <italic>n</italic> = 7) and SM for 3 weeks with rTMS for 2 weeks (SM+rTMS group, <italic>n</italic> = 8).</p>

                <title>Simulated Microgravity With Sham Stimulation Rat Model and rTMS Treatment</title>
                <p>The SM+sham rat model was built for 3 weeks, in which rats were suspended at the tail of 30 degrees and were sham-stimulated from the second week. Thirty degrees tail-suspension (TS) rats were used as the model to simulate the physiological effects of weightlessness. It was obtained using the model adapted from Wronski and Morey-Holton (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Morey-Holton and Globus, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhai et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, each rat was first fixed with a rat-fixing device, only its tail was exposed and washed with warm water and soapy water. Then wiped with a towel as much as possible to prevent excessive stimulation of the sticker on its tail. Next, applied rosin and benzoin powder. The purpose of applying rosin powder was to make the tail astringent and better stick medical adhesive tape. And the purpose of applying benzoin powder was to prevent rats from infection and decay of tail due to long modeling time. Thirdly, the tail of the rat was wrapped in a breathable gauze, and then the nylon rope was connected with the horizontal beam of the tail suspension cage with a key clasp. The tail suspension cage is a cube of 35 Ã 35 Ã 35 cm. And the key buckle can make the rats rotate along 360 degrees horizontally to feed freely and drink water, then we can adjust the height of the horizontal beam so that the hind limbs of the rats cannot touch the bottom of the tail suspension cage when stretching, and then keep the level of the trunk and the bottom of the tail suspension cage at 30 degrees. After 21 days of SM+sham modeling, the gauze should be carefully removed for subsequent experiments.</p>
                <p>In SM+rTMS group, we started whole brain rTMS from the second week of modeling, and rats were placed in rat fixators. The magnetic stimulator from Institute of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences was used. The parameter of the magnetic stimulations were a coil with the frequency of 10 Hz, the stimulus intensity was 1T, the voltage was 800 V, each sequence had 30 pulses, there were 10 pulses in the interval of 50 s, once a day for 14 days (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wassermann and Lisanby, 2001</xref>).</p>

In this experiment, it was evaluated to the gait indicators of rats in open space with fewer interference factors, such as walking speed, walking distance, rest time in the open box, and so on. The experimental device is a cube (length: 100 cm; width: 100 cm; height: 40 cm) with black bottom. A camera is installed 70.6 cm away from the bottom to collect the ratâs trajectory. The device is surrounded by a shade. During the experiment, it is in a dark and quiet state, avoiding unnecessary influence on the experimental animals, to affect the experimental results. On a given trial, the rats were placed in the center of the apparatus. Then rats were allowed to explore freely 5 min before being removed. Video tracking software was used to collect the walking distance, speed, and other indicators of rats in the open field (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mysoet et al., 2017</xref>).

                  <p>The apparatus consists of a 115-cm diameter circular pool filled with water (temperature = 23 Â± 2Â°C) to a level of 42 cm. A visible platform (diameter = 7 cm) with a texture that allows rats to cling on it is positioned in the middle of the pool. The platform emerges â¼2â3 cm. This height makes an effort from the rats to climb on it (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Canu et al., 2007</xref>). In turn, the rats were put into the water from the same position facing the wall of the pond. If the rat did not reach the platform after 60 s, it would be manually guided to the platform by the experimenter, recording the time of climbing the platform (from the beginning of reaching the platform with the forelimbs to the end of climbing all the hind limbs on the platform). Video tracking software was used to record swimming speed, swimming distance, time of immobility in water, and other parameters of rats. There was only one trial in the experiment. Only successful trials were taken into account.</p>

Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane for 3 Â± 2 min, and then intraperitoneally injected with a 30% uratan solution according to 0.35% ratâs body weight. Next, the ratâs head was fixed on the stereotaxis apparatus and then removed the hair from the head. Furthermore, the ratâs eye and its surroundings were also smeared with erythromycin eye ointment and the scalp was wiped with iodine wine to prevent infection. And then we should label Primary motor cortex (M1), Secondary motor cortex (M2), and anterior fontanel according to the 6th Edition of Stereotaxic Map of Rat Brain. Among them, the coordinates of M1 and M2 area are respectively: M1: anterior fontanel 1.00 Â± 0.1 mm, sagittal suture 2.00 Â± 0.1 mm, depth 0.55 Â± 0.1 mm; M2: anterior fontanel 3.0 Â± 0.1 mm, sagittal suture 1.6 Â± 0.1 mm, depth 0.4 Â± 0.1 mm.

                <p>Next, we measured the walking and swimming ability of the rats by observing the performance in an open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,D</xref>).

                <p>Previously, we used the open field experiment to measure the locomotor activity in an open field arena (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kraeuter et al., 2019</xref>). In order to eliminate the influence of mood change on gait behaviors in rats, we adopted more professional equipment to examine the gait of rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures3A,B</xref>). It was found that the walking speed of the rats on the track was consistent with the experimental results in the open field (CON: 24.49 Â± 1.40 cm/s; SM+sham: 17.61 Â± 2.11 cm/s; SM+rTMS: 15.70 Â± 2.00 cm/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). When observing the stride length of rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>), it was found that rTMS had no significant effect on the decrease of the stride length caused by SM (CON: 9.60 Â± 1.47 cm; SM+sham: 5.84 Â± 1.08 cm; SM+rTMS: 5.60 Â± 0.83 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). While it was worth noting that SM caused a increase of step spacing, indicating that the hind limbs were overextended, and rTMS could reverse this change (CON: 0.26 Â± 0.02 cm; SM+sham: 0.36 Â± 0.03 cm; SM+rTMS: 0.15 Â± 0.01 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3F</xref>, CON vs SM+sham, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; CON vs SM+rTMS, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). When comparing the time support percentage of different feet, SM or rTMS treatment did not affect the single foot and ipsilateral feet support percentage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figures 1A,B</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but significantly decreased the support time of the contralateral feet (CON: 14.43 Â± 1.66%; SM+sham: 8.44 Â± 1.07%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Further observation of the strength revealed that SM caused an uneven distribution of the strength of the contralateral feet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and rTMS could improve these effects to a certain extent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref> showed the time-dependent variation of the pressure of each foot contacting with the ground, with the intensity ranging from 0 to 255 MPa. The support time of the tripod feet was significantly increased in the SM+sham group (CON: 10.19 Â± 2.24%; SM+sham: 22.55 Â± 3.43%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3J</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), which recovered to a normal level with rTMS treatment (SM+rTMS: 7.80 Â± 3.10%).

                <title>rTMS Can Influence the Neural Oscillation by Changing the Energy Distribution in Different Frequency Bands in the M1 and M2 Regions</title>
                <p>We recorded the electrophysiological signals from M1 and M2 areas of the rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>) and preliminarily screened the collected LFP signals and further analyzed with MATLAB software. In M1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4C,D</xref> showed that compared to control rats, the power of LFP in low-frequency band in rats after rTMS treatment was enhanced while suppressed in high-frequency band. To further quantify and precisely evaluate the effect of rTMS treatment on the power spectra of M1, the relative LFP power in three bands were computed in the signals (the bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>). ANOVA analysis showed a significant effect in the Î´ (2â4 Hz), Î¸ (4â7 Hz), and Î± (7â12 Hz) bands. Compared to control group, the group treated with rTMS showed higher relative powers of Î´ (61.57 Â± 3.07 vs 71.77 Â± 1.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and lower relative powers of Î¸ (21.61 Â± 0.92 vs 18.10 Â± 1.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and Î± (17.80 Â± 2.30 vs 11.02 Â± 0.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). In M2, the relative LFP powers had similar results to those observed in M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4E,F</xref>). Compared to control rats, the rats treated with rTMS showed higher relative power of Î´ (62.32 Â± 3.65 vs 74.50 Â± 0.97, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), lower relative power of Î¸ (20.53 Â± 0.88 vs 17.53 Â± 0.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015), and Î± (18.07 Â± 2.93 vs 8.84 Â± 0.86, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). The results of rTMS treatment showed that rTMS can influence the neural oscillation by changing the energy distribution in different frequency bands in M1 and M2 regions.</p>

                <p>Then we examined whether SM and rTMS treatment had any effects on the morphology of neurons. The observation was as follows: in the motor cortex, the neurons in the CON group were closely arranged, while in the SM+sham group there were notable tissue changes characterized by fewer cells and scattered arrangement. In the rTMS group, the cells were occasionally ruptured, but the tissues were intact (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Summary of the above showed that rTMS had a certain effect on the morphological changes of the above nerve cells, which may be one of the reasons why it could influence the neural oscillation.</p>

                <title>rTMS Treatment Activates mTOR in the Motor Cortex</title>
                <p>Human studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of mTOR in exercise-dependent cortical neural remodeling, which helps to improve the acquisition of motor skills (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Chen K. et al., 2019</xref>). So after the electrophysiology recording, we then investigated the expression of IGF-1, Akt and its phosphorylated protein in the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The results showed that SM and rTMS had no significant effect on their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6BâD</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Further, the expression of PI3K protein was decreased by SM (CON: 2.18 Â± 0.25; SM+sham: 1.12 Â± 0.12; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which was not impacted by rTMS (SM+rTMS: 1.20 Â± 0.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6E</xref>). We also found elevated mTOR in the motor cortex after rTMS treatment (CON: 1.02Â±0.07; SM+sham: 1.05Â±0.09; SM+rTMS: 1.28 Â± 0.08; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6F</xref>, CON vs SM+rTMS, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031), indicating the activation of mTOR by rTMS. These data collectively demonstrated rTMS-induced mTOR activation in the motor cortex, but it did not affect the downregulation of PI3K caused by SM.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Despite dozens of studies reporting that the beneficial effects of rTMS in improving dyskinesia in different models of rats including spinal cord injury, Parkinson diseases and cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Arfani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Petrosyan et al., 2017</xref>), it is understood that the underlying causes of dyskinesia in above diseases are different from microgravity in causing gait disorders in astronauts. So the underlying mechanism of rTMS acting on gait disorders caused by SM is still less known. Our current study provides the first evidence showing that rTMS treatment can improve the gait disorders caused by SM to some extent and clarifies its mechanism from different perspectives, including behavioral experiments (open field, swimming, and gait analysis), electrophysiological experiment and biochemical tests (HE staining and western blot).</p>
              <p>The first finding is that rTMS can potentially reverse SM-induced weight loss in rats and improve muscle atrophy, however the changes in body weight may have been caused by modeling effects on feeding and excretion in rats (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2019</xref>). As for sport-related hindlimb muscles, why did SM cause the Sol to atrophy, but not the MG? This may be because SM causes a shift in muscle type from slow (I type fiber) to fast (II type fiber) (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Sol is a type I fiber muscle (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner et al., 2018</xref>), and additionally it is possible that fluid loss demonstrated by Sol atrophy is caused by head displacement, which is consistent with previous results (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Gumucio and Mendias, 2013</xref>). Reversal of Sol atrophy associated rTMS treatment may be related to the expression of some motor-related proteins in Sol, but more research is needed to understand this relationship.</p>
              <p>The second finding is rTMS impacts motor abilities after SM, improving motor behaviors to some extent. Gait analysis is a commonly used method in the study of the behavior of mice, which could detect many indicators such as footprint area, stride length, footprint support, footprint strength, and so on (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hruska et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Deumens et al., 2007</xref>). Based on this, one important result was that rTMS largely mitigated SM-induced shorter supporting time for the contralateral feet and longer supporting time for the tripod. Similar results were obtained for the strength of the contralateral foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>). These results indicate that rTMS can improve the imbalance of the contralateral limb caused by SM during the movement of rats, however it needs to be noted that there is still myasthenia in the hind limbs that was not alleviated.</p>
              <p>The motor cortex is essential for the execution of motor information, and M1 and M2 are the most advanced centers of body control (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Byblow et al., 2007</xref>). The M1 is responsible for the coding of movement (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bryszewski et al., 2012</xref>), the M2 is responsible for the integration of spatial information toward the updating of planned movements, which is further projected to the M1, brainstem, spinal cord, and other regions involved in motion control (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Olson et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, LFP signals in M1 and M2 regions were recorded in this study to explore the effect of rTMS treatment on neural oscillations in motor cortex. We have two main conclusions from the results: (1) It was found for the first time that SM did not affect LFP activity (2â12 Hz), which had not been noticed before. In other models, such as Parkinsonâs rats, the power of motor cortex is inhibited at 1â4 Hz (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2016a</xref>), and the interaction between motor cortex and pedunculopontine nucleus in the range of Î¸ (4â7 Hz) and Î± (7â12 Hz) is enhanced (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brazhnik et al., 2012</xref>). These abnormal neural oscillation activities are closely related to the dyskinesia symptoms of Parkinsonâs rats, such as abnormal gait and unstable posture (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Geng et al., 2016b</xref>). In our study, we did not find a similar change indicating the specificity of different conditions. To explain why the abnormal behavior can be observed in SM, we give two possible mechanisms. Firstly, SM may affect the high-frequency LFP signal of motor cortex, which has been suggested in the previous study: the symptoms of gait disorders in SM rats are always related to the neural oscillations in the motor cortex with the peak frequency of LFP â¼80 Hz (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Brys et al., 2018</xref>). However, we did not detect in our study due to the limitations of the experimental conditions which can be further recorded under the awake state (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Belluscio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Rolland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). So SM may cause the change of neural rhythm in its downstream neural network, which is manifested as the disturbance of motor behavior, but not the change of neural oscillation in motor cortex.</p>
              <p>(2) The effects of rTMS on M1 and M2 of SM rats were similar, both of which increased the energy of Î´ (2â4 Hz) and decreased in Î¸ (4â7 Hz) and Î± (7â12 Hz). A previous study pointed that rTMS, as a neural regulatory technique, can modulate cortical brain rhythms, especially low-frequency oscillations (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Noh, 2012</xref>). So we speculate that rTMS could regulate the energy distribution of different frequency bands (Î´, Î¸, and Î±) of motor cortex, especially by enhancing the energy of Î´ (2â4 Hz) frequency band. This has proved the hypothesis that we put forward earlier.</p>
              <p>The above results suggested that rTMS may improve gait disorders by regulating neural oscillations in motor cortex. But the specific molecular mechanism remained to be further discovered. We examined the expression of IGF-1-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in the motor cortex. IGF-1 has been proved to increase neurotransmitter release and discharge of pyramidal neurons by promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the motor cortex, and excitability of sensorimotor cortex neurons (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). PI3K protein is then activated by IGF-1, which induces the phosphorylation of Akt and controls the activation of two targets related to protein synthesis, one of which is mTOR (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we did not observe the change of IGF-1 and Akt proteins in the motor cortex after SM modeling. This is inconsistent with previous results in which they were found decreased after a 14-day period of SM (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen B. et al., 2019</xref>). The inconsistency may be due to the length of modeling time (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Mysoet et al., 2017</xref>). However, it has been reported that the activation of mTOR can promote axonal regeneration of corticospinal neurons, and then enhance neuronal activity (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zareen et al., 2018</xref>). Our results suggest that rTMS may enhance the neuronal activity of the motor cortex through the activation of mTOR, leading to the improvement of gait disorders. So mTOR can be an attractive therapeutic target and deserves further investigations.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Combining our results with previous studies, it was found that there is a progressive reduction in the ability of motor cortex to produce muscle forces under SM conditions. Processes within the nervous system, as well as within the muscles both contribute to gait disorders (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">PannÃ©rec et al., 2016</xref>). Our results indicated that the regulation at high level of the nervous system could improve gait ability and fatigue induced by SM. The mechanism was associated with the regulation of the energy distribution of different frequency bands (Î´, Î¸, and Î±) of motor cortex, especially by enhancing the energy of Î´ (2â4 Hz) frequency band, as well as the activation of mTOR protein by rTMS, which could enhance the control of nervous system on hindlimb muscle, ultimately achieving the improvement in gait behaviors. However, during rTMS treatment, the relative contribution of nerve and muscle factors in motor improvement has not been thoroughly understood (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2006</xref>), and further studies are still needed.</p>
