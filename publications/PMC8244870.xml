              <abstract>
                <p>As we explore beyond Earth, astronauts may be at risk for harmful DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Double-strand breaks are a type of DNA damage that can be repaired by two major cellular pathways: non-homologous end joining, during which insertions or deletions may be added at the break site, and homologous recombination, in which the DNA sequence often remains unchanged. Previous work suggests that space conditions may impact the choice of DNA repair pathway, potentially compounding the risks of increased radiation exposure during space travel. However, our understanding of this problem has been limited by technical and safety concerns, which have prevented integral study of the DNA repair process in space. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system offers a model for the safe and targeted generation of double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Here we describe a CRISPR-based assay for DNA break induction and assessment of double-strand break repair pathway choice entirely in space. As necessary steps in this process, we describe the first successful genetic transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space. These milestones represent a significant expansion of the molecular biology toolkit onboard the International Space Station.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Astronauts traveling beyond the protective boundaries of Earth’s magnetosphere are at an increased risk of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Such DNA damage may lead to cancer and other detrimental health effects, raising questions about the safety of long-duration space travel [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p>
              <p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs), in which the phosphate backbones of both DNA strands are hydrolyzed, are a particularly harmful type of DNA lesion [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On Earth, eukaryotic organisms use at least two mechanisms for repairing DSBs: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During HR, a homologous DNA sequence is used as a template for repair so that the DNA sequence remains unchanged. HR repair is typically limited to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. NHEJ, however, can occur at any point in the cell cycle [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During NHEJ the cell directly rejoins the two pieces of DNA, often resulting in changes to the original DNA sequence [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These alterations may increase the risk of cancer and other detrimental conditions.</p>
              <p>In space, a significant portion of the ionizing radiation is Galactic Cosmic Radiation which is mainly composed of high linear energy transfer (LET) particles. These particles can create clustered and complex DNA damage that may be difficult to repair [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, repair pathway choice may be especially important in mitigating damage from space radiation. For example, work by Zafar et al. suggests that HR is critical in repairing DNA damage caused by high-LET particles [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that the choice of DNA repair mechanism can be influenced by microgravity conditions. However, because of safety considerations and technological limitations, these studies have often relied on the generation of DSBs on Earth, after which the biological material was frozen and sent to space to assess DNA repair choice under microgravity conditions [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The initial recognition of the DNA break and the assembly of DNA repair factors at the break site are thought to be important determinants of repair pathway choice and may occur soon after the DSB [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that in previous studies of DNA repair in space the choice of repair occurred on Earth rather than in space. Furthermore, the rigors of space launch and associated handling introduce extraneous factors between induction of a DSB on Earth and eventual assessment of DNA repair [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We therefore sought to develop a method to study DSB break induction and repair entirely in the microgravity environment onboard the International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory.</p>
              <p>Our method relies on using a CRISPR-based mutagenesis strategy for the targeted generation of DSBs at a defined genomic locus. During CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing, the Cas9 nuclease is directed by an engineered guide RNA to recognize and create a DSB at a specific site in the genome [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. DNA repair mechanisms then make changes to the DNA sequence at the site of the DSB. NHEJ may introduce random insertions or deletions at the break site, while HR can be harnessed to make specific changes to the DNA sequence through an engineered repair template [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
              <p>Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to study DNA repair in space has several advantages over previously established models. First, this system does not utilize radiation or other reagents that cause widespread, non-specific DNA damage and are unsafe to use during spaceflight. Second, because the DSB is generated at a precise location in the genome, any changes in DNA sequence following repair can be easily identified and tracked using methods previously validated on the ISS, namely, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here we describe the first transformation of <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> with exogenous genetic material followed by the first CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space. These experiments were part of a complete workflow developed to allow the study of DNA repair entirely onboard the ISS National Lab. This workflow spans the targeted generation of DNA lesions in organisms living under microgravity conditions to the site-specific confirmation of DNA repair by molecular methods. Implementation of these techniques represents a significant expansion of the molecular biology toolkit onboard the ISS and lays the groundwork for future experiments to address a sweeping array of questions and practical needs pertaining to space exploration and colonization.</p>

Adaptation of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cerevisiae</italic> transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing protocols for use onboard the ISS. Prior to launch, cells were grown in liquid culture on Earth, pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen in glycerol at -80°C for transport to the ISS. Step 1, transformation: transformation mixture and pVG1 vector were added to thawed cells. The miniPCR thermal cycler was used as a heat block to induce transformation. Following transformation, cells were plated on synthetic defined agar lacking uracil (SDA-URA) and grown at room temperature for six days when the phenotype of the colonies was assessed. Step 2, DNA extraction: A pipette tip was used to transfer a small number of cells from four red and four white colonies to the DNA extraction buffer. Cells were heated in the miniPCR thermal cycler to 95°C to extract the DNA. Step 3, PCR and barcoding: DNA extract was directly added to PCR reagents. PCR was performed to amplify the 5’ end of the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> gene. Sequencing barcodes were added at this step. Step 4, sample pooling and magnetic bead clean up: PCR product was pooled and purified during a magnetic bead cleanup step. Step 5, nanopore sequencing: Purified PCR product was sequenced by nanopore sequencing. Data was downlinked to the ground where sequences were assessed.</p>

                <p>In pVG1-transformed <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cerevisiae</italic>, Cas9, directed by the guide RNA, introduces a DSB in the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> sequence leading to the induction of DNA repair. As <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cerevisiae</italic> relies heavily on homology directed repair, we hypothesized that transformed cells would utilize the repair template on the pVG1 plasmid to repair the DSB instead of NHEJ. Use of this template would result in a change at nucleotide 55 of the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> sequence where six base pairs of the wild type sequence are replaced with a 12 base pair sequence that includes two stop codons and an EcoRI restriction site [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given that NHEJ repair would also introduce mutations at the break site, the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> gene will be mutated following CRISPR editing regardless of repair mechanism, resulting in a red phenotype and enabling visual identification of edited cells (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
                <p>The choice of repair pathway can be determined by analyzing the DNA sequence at the break site to determine whether the sequence includes the expected repair template sequence, indicating repair by HR, or whether the sequence contains random insertions or deletions, indicating NHEJ was used. This type of DNA sequence analysis can be performed using methods that have been previously established to work in space, specifically amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by nanopore sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

                <p>The preparation of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cerevisiae</italic> competent cells for this experiment was adapted from standard protocols to facilitate transport to and transformation onboard the ISS. Yeast BY4741 cells were grown on Earth to a concentration of approximately 1x10<sup>8</sup> cells per milliliter, pelleted by centrifugation, and frozen at -80°C for shipment to the ISS or kept as ground controls (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Onboard the ISS, and on the ground in parallel, pellets were thawed and resuspended in 100 mM lithium acetate, before being combined with a transformation mixture that included polyethylene glycol, lithium acetate, and the pVG1 plasmid (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). The miniPCR thermal cycler [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was then used as a heat block to induce transformation (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
                <p>Following transformation, cells were transferred to Petri dishes containing synthetic defined agar lacking uracil (SDA-URA plates) for growth and selection of transformants (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). To plate the cells in microgravity, small volumes of liquid culture (~20 μl) were transferred to the surface of the agar using a micropipette and then spread using a sterile plastic spreader (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Video</xref>). By transferring small volumes, the surface tension was sufficient to keep the yeast suspension attached to the agar before being spread by the force of a sterile plastic spreader. Ground controls were prepared in parallel using the same methods.</p>

                <title>Genotypic confirmation of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing</title>
                <p>To confirm successful CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> locus was examined using PCR and DNA sequencing. Four red colonies (labeled R1-R4) and four white colonies (labeled W1-W4) were randomly selected from both ISS and ground transformation plates for DNA extraction (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2E</xref>). DNA was extracted from these colonies using a simple protocol where cells were heated to 95°C for 10 minutes in DNA extraction buffer.</p>
                <p>Following DNA extraction, the 5’ end of the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> sequence was amplified by PCR. PCR primers contained short barcode sequences; a total of four barcodes were used to identify the individual colonies sampled. Following amplification, the samples were combined into two pools of four samples each and purified using magnetic beads [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Purified DNA was sequenced using the MinION nanopore sequencer (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Sequencing data was downlinked to Earth for analysis.</p>
                <p>Sequencing of four pooled white colonies grown during spaceflight (flight) or on the ground yielded 1.3 million and 1.0 million total reads respectively, while sequencing of four pooled red colonies grown in flight or on the ground yielded over 5.0 million and 2.0 million total reads, respectively. Total read count varied between individual barcodes, however, all yielded sufficient quantities for analysis (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Consensus sequences from seven of the eight white colonies aligned to the wild type <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> sequence while consensus sequences from all eight of the red colonies aligned to the <italic toggle="yes">ade2</italic> repair template for both flight and ground (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). The median alignment identity was 92% (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). However, two ground white colonies, W1 and W3, had unusually low coverage at some base pairs near the Cas9 cut site (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Sanger sequencing upon return to ground confirmed that ground W1 and W3 contained 9 base pair and 3 base pair deletions, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
                <p>The consensus sequence obtained from flight white colony W2 aligned to the <italic toggle="yes">ade2</italic> repair template sequence rather than to the wild type <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> sequence (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>).

                <p>The four ground red colonies that were sequenced had between 88% and 100% coverage of the 12-nucleotide <italic toggle="yes">ade2</italic> repair reference template, while the four red colonies from flight had only 59–75% sequencing coverage (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

Microgravity poses challenges to liquid handling and safety concerns prohibit the use of equipment and reagents common in most laboratory settings on Earth. Therefore, the protocol described here required alterations to standard methods. For example, our transformation protocol reduced total sample volumes and used reagents that were premixed and frozen rather than prepared fresh as is usually done. This likely resulted in lower transformation efficiencies for both the flight and ground controls compared to what is typically seen in traditional <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cerevisiae</italic> transformation experiments. However, the transformation efficiency was still sufficient to allow the detection of CRISPR edited cells. Future studies could focus on improving the efficiency of the transformation protocol described here to allow a more extensive investigation of the frequency of HR compared to NHEJ DNA repair in microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>Although our protocol deviated from standard methods for the study of DNA repair on Earth, we find that it was generally sufficient to determine the mechanism of repair. In general, we obtained a lower number of reads from each red colony sequenced than was obtained from white colonies (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). This is likely due to the smaller colony size (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Regardless, our nanopore sequencing data is of sufficient quality to deduce the repair mechanism used by the yeast cells (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In this study, we confirmed that all red colonies sampled aligned to the repair template sequence, indicating that they were repaired using homologous recombination. These methods could enable quantification of repair pathway usage in future studies [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0253403.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>Although our workflow represents a significant step towards enabling a better understanding of DNA repair pathway choice in microgravity conditions, this approach has one notable limitation. DSBs generated by Cas9 are much simpler than those generated by high-LET particles found in space [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As the complexity of the DNA damage may influence repair pathway choice, our model may not fully recapitulate the conditions found outside of Earth’s magnetosphere [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Future studies could attempt to better mimic the effects of high-LET radiation by generating more complex breaks. For example, one might imagine creating clustered DNA damage sites using multiple gRNAs simultaneously.</p>
              <p>Some noteworthy differences between flight and ground controls were observed. Initial sequencing data collected onboard the ISS for Flight W2, a colony with a white phenotype, aligned to the edited ADE2 repair template sequence. Subsequent Sanger sequencing analysis conducted upon return to ground confirmed the wild type genotype instead, as expected for a colony of the white phenotype (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). It is likely that this discrepancy arose from a sampling or processing error during in-flight procedures. Additionally, nanopore sequencing data indicated that two ground control white colonies, ground W1, and ground W3, had lower coverage at several base pairs downstream of the Cas9 cut site, a finding suggestive of in-frame deletions (<xref rid="pone.0253403.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of these deletions (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), ruling out sequencing or PCR errors. As the deletions are in-frame they do not appear to have altered the colony phenotype and may have been caused by Cas9 nuclease activity followed by NHEJ repair or by another form of mutagenesis. No such deletions were observed in our flight samples. While the finding that indels occurred only in ground conditions might represent a finding of biological significance, the number of colonies sampled is too low to make any conclusions about the effects of space conditions on DNA repair pathway choice based on the current study alone.</p>
              <p>Finally, the nanopore sequencing data from the flight and ground red colonies shows one intriguing difference. While greater than 90 percent of the reads from ground controls align to the <italic toggle="yes">ade2</italic> repair template sequence, the flight reads show more heterogeneity, with a significant portion aligning to the <italic toggle="yes">ADE2</italic> wildtype sequence (<xref rid="pone.0253403.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). This increased heterogeneity may simply be due to procedural differences in how the ISS crewmembers sampled the colonies compared to how they were sampled on the ground. Alternatively, this heterogeneity may reflect biological differences between the flight and ground CRISPR-edited colonies. Further study is needed to fully explain this observation.</p>
              <p>Taken together, our results demonstrate the first successful use of both transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space and represent a significant expansion of the molecular biology toolkit onboard the ISS. In addition to establishing a viable platform for furthering our understanding of DNA repair in microgravity, these tools may enable the adaptation of many powerful methods for use in space. For example, the applications of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing on Earth are rapidly expanding to include a number of gene editing approaches as well as novel uses of this technology such as viral detection [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. One might imagine how CRISPR screens can expand our understanding of biological responses to microgravity or the utility of a simple detection assay in ensuring astronaut safety on long-duration missions. Similarly, genetic transformation of microbes has many applications, including the production of large amounts of a desired protein on demand. In the future, transformation in space might allow for on-demand production of critical medicines during deep space missions, or be used for pharmaceutical microgravity research in orbiting laboratories such as those currently in development by several commercial entities [<xref rid="pone.0253403.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Our study has the potential to impact both our understanding of basic biological processes in microgravity as well as future space exploration and colonization and highlights the importance of basic molecular biology research onboard the ISS National Lab.</p>

              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing" ext-link-type="uri">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>

              <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: </p>
              <p>In the article “A CRISPR-based assay for the study of eukaryotic DNA repair onboard the International Space Station” the authors report on a study on the DNA double strand break repair pathway selection in yeast on board the international space station using the CRISPR Cas9 system. Homologous Recombination is discriminated from Non-homologous end joining by next generation sequencing of the DSB site following DSB generation by the CRISPR Cas9 nuclease in the presence of an alternative homologous repair template. The experiments are accompanied by similar experiments conducted on earth to access differences in micro-gravity environment.</p>
              <p>Overall the study is sound and demonstrates the future possibilities of molecular biology experiments on board the ISS. Due to the limitations in replicates the scientific outcome is limited. Nevertheless, considering the experimental limitations during space flight, I support the publication of the manuscript and only have some minor points.</p>
              <p>Minor points:</p>
              <p>Supplementary File naming as well as the authors list is not consistent with the main title.</p>
              <p>Introduction, line 38 onwards: The authors should also mention the special type / complexity of DSBs generated by cosmic irradiation present in space.</p>
              <p>Introduction, line 55 onwards: The authors should also include cell cycle specific aspects, when they discuss pathway selection DSB repair, especially in humans.</p>
              <p>Results, line 103: I would replace he term “ADE2 mutant lines” with “ADE2 mutant colonies”</p>
              <p>Results Figure 2: Since the colonies are not clearly visible (at least in the images provided to me) I would suggest to included a cropped inset of one colony each.</p>
              <p>Methods, line 297: The authors should add the wavelength at with the O.D. was measured.</p>

              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>The manuscript by Stahl-Rommel and colleagues report the first attempt to undertake a simple DNA repair assay in space. This is important since an understanding of differences in maintaining genome stability on space have far-reaching implications for technologies that can employed in space and human health in space.</p>
              <p>Sensibly, the team opted to use budding yeast as this is the most robust and best-characterised eukaryotic system available, coupled to an assay which suitable for studying the repair of targeted DNA double-strand breaks. The work is clearly presented and the caveats in interpreting the limited data obtained openly discussed.</p>
              <p>I have only very minor comments:</p>
              <p>1. I would suggest growing the yeast cells to a density of less than 1 x 108 CFU/mL (perhaps 2 x 107) might give a better transformation efficiency in future studies.</p>
              <p>2. In the Introduction (p2, line 51) the possibility that microgravity conditions might influence DNA repair pathway usage or efficiency, which is an interesting possibility. It is also worth pointing out to readers that the ionising radiation background in space might damage DNA breaks close to their termini and this could influence repair efficiency. This is especially relevant during repair by HR, where tracts of ssDNA are generated as intermediates that might be more susceptible to such collateral damage. Such 'collateral' damage could plausibly influence the efficiency and outcome of repair.</p>

              <p>To whom it may concern, </p>
              <p>We wish to thank the editor and both reviewers for their thoughtful comments our manuscript entitled “A CRISPR-based assay for the study of eukaryotic DNA repair onboard the International Space Station.” Below, we have included our responses to each point that was raised. We hope that we have satisfactorily addressed these concerns and that our manuscript is now suitable for publication. </p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Emily Gleason, Ph.D. Sebastian Kraves, Ph.D.</p>
              <p>Academic editor: </p>
              <p>1) Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p>
              <p>We have updated the title page to meet the title, author, affiliations formatting guide in both the manuscript. We additionally made changes to the way we referred to figures and tables within the manuscript text to better match the style guide. Finally, we have re-saved the supporting information as separate documents for each figure rather than as 1 compiled document and removed the author information from the names of all of our files. De-compiling the supporting information required us add S3 table that includes the Sanger sequencing data. We hope these changes are satisfactory and make our manuscript fit for publication. </p>
              <p>2) PLOS requires an ORCID iD for the corresponding author in Editorial Manager on papers submitted after December 6th, 2016. Please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. </p>
              <p>Sebastian Kraves’ ORCID iD is 0000-0002-6153-8029 Emily Gleason’s ORCID iD is 0000-0001-6875-8609. Emily Gleason’s was provided during the initial submission of the manuscript. </p>

The remaining authors declare no competing financial interests.</p>
              <p>4) We note that you have stated that you will provide repository information for your data at acceptance. Should your manuscript be accepted for publication, we will hold it until you provide the relevant accession numbers or DOIs necessary to access your data. If you wish to make changes to your Data Availability statement, please describe these changes in your cover letter and we will update your Data Availability statement to reflect the information you provide.</p>
              <p>We had uploaded the data to ENA, but kept it private pending the acceptance of the manuscript. The data has now been made public. You can find it in the ENA database under project PRJEB39039 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB39039" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB39039</ext-link>). </p>
              <p>5) We note that Figure 2 includes an image of a participant in the study. Please amend the methods section and ethics statement of the manuscript to explicitly state that the patient/participant has provided consent for publication: “The individual in this manuscript has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publish these case details”. If you are unable to obtain consent from the subject of the photograph, you will need to remove the figure and any other textual identifying information or case descriptions for this individual.</p>
              <p>The individual pictured is not a study participant, but rather Astronaut Christina Koch, one of the three astronauts who performed this work on the International Space Station. The images were supplied to us by NASA and as such, are not subject to copyright in the United States. NASA media guidelines state that these images may be used without explicit permission (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html</ext-link>). We have amended the figure legend to credit NASA for the images of Astronaut Koch as well as the image in Fig 2 B. We hope that this change is sufficient for these images to be included in the publication. </p>
              <p>6) Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references.

              <p>Reviewer #1:</p>
              <p>Minor points:</p>
              <p>• Supplementary File naming as well as the authors list is not consistent with the main title.</p>
              <p>We removed the author and title from the supporting information document and saved each figure and table individually rather than as 1 compiled document. We hope these changes address reviewer #1’s concerns. </p>
              <p>• Introduction, line 38 onwards: The authors should also mention the special type / complexity of DSBs generated by cosmic irradiation present in space.</p>
              <p>This is a great suggestion. We have added a few sentences to address this to the introduction (lines78-83) and included three additional references (Chancellor et al., 2014, Schipler et al., 2013, Zafar et al. 2010). We hope this appropriately addresses reviewer 1’s comments. </p>
              <p>• Introduction, line 55 onwards: The authors should also include cell cycle specific aspects, when they discuss pathway selection DSB repair, especially in humans.</p>
              <p>We have added some information regarding cell cycle impacts for repair pathway selection to the introduction (lines 72-74) and an additional reference (Zhao et al., 2020). </p>
              <p>• Results, line 103: I would replace he term “ADE2 mutant lines” with “ADE2 mutant colonies”</p>
              <p>We have made the suggested change to the manuscript. </p>
              <p>• Results Figure 2: Since the colonies are not clearly visible (at least in the images provided to me) I would suggest to included a cropped inset of one colony each.</p>
              <p>As there are colonies of both phenotypes on each plate, we were concerned about misleading people if we implemented the suggestion to choose one colony to include as an inset for each plate. Instead, we added a new subpanel (Fig. 2D) that gives a zoomed in example of each phenotype to illustrate the differences between edited and unedited colonies. We hope this addresses Reviewer #1’s concerns about the visibility of the colonies. </p>
              <p>• Methods, line 297: The authors should add the wavelength at with the O.D. was measured.</p>
              <p>We used O.D. 600, this information has been added to the manuscript. </p>
              <p>• Methods, line 301-302: “Final cell pellets..” In my understanding the number of 1x10^8 cells is per pellet or total number, but not cells/ml. Or is this number representing the cell concentration after resuspension/reconstitution? The authors should clarify this point.</p>
              <p>We have attempted to clarify this in the manuscript. </p>
              <p>• Methods, line 329 onwards: The authors describe that both the ground control as the in flight petri dishes were kept at room temperature. RT is not defined and should be given. Was it identical on the ISS and on the ground? If not this could explain the differences in colony size.</p>
              <p>Ambient temperature is not precisely measured in either location, but would be between 20 and 25 ºC. We have noted this in the manuscript. </p>
              <p>• Methods, line 341: The bar-coding process should be explained in more detail, may be also with a small sketch, to help the less experienced reader to understand it.</p>
              <p>We feel that explaining the details of the bar-coding process is a bit out of scope for this publication. Instead, we have added a reference to a source that explains this process in detail (lines 449-442, Matsou et. al. 2021). We hope this addresses reviewer 1’s concern. </p>
              <p>• Figure 1 has some elements at the end of the page that are probably misplaced.</p>
              <p>This error occurred when switching file types. It has been corrected. </p>
              <p>• Supplementary information: it reads “…Archive (ENA) under project PRJEB39039 (add link)”. No link is available and I could not find the mentioned project in ENA.</p>
              <p>See above comment. We had uploaded the data to ENA, but kept it private pending the acceptance of the manuscript. The data has now been made public. You can find it in the ENA database under project PRJEB39039 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB39039" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB39039</ext-link>). </p>
              <p>Reviewer #2: </p>
              <p>I have only very minor comments:</p>
              <p>• I would suggest growing the yeast cells to a density of less than 1 x 108 CFU/mL (perhaps 2 x 107) might give a better transformation efficiency in future studies.</p>
              <p>We appreciate the suggestion. If we are given the opportunity to fly a follow up study, we will keep this in mind. </p>
              <p>• In the Introduction (p2, line 51) the possibility that microgravity conditions might influence DNA repair pathway usage or efficiency, which is an interesting possibility. It is also worth pointing out to readers that the ionising radiation background in space might damage DNA breaks close to their termini and this could influence repair efficiency. This is especially relevant during repair by HR, where tracts of ssDNA are generated as intermediates that might be more susceptible to such collateral damage. Such 'collateral' damage could plausibly influence the efficiency and outcome of repair.</p>
              <p>This is a great point and similar to one of reviewer 1’s comments. We added a few sentences to the introduction (lines 78-83) and three new references (Chancellor et al., 2014, Schipler et al., 2013, Zafar et al. 2010). We additionally added a paragraph to the discussion that addresses the differences between the DNA lesions created by Cas9 and those thought to be created by galactic cosmic radiation (lines 323-330). We hope this sufficiently addresses reviewer 2’s comment.</p>
