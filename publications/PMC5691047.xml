                <p id="Par1">As the range and duration of human ventures into space increase, it becomes imperative that we understand the effects of the cosmic environment on astronaut health. Molecular technologies now widely used in research and medicine will need to become available in space to ensure appropriate care of astronauts. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for DNA analysis, yet its potential for use on-orbit remains under-explored. We describe DNA amplification aboard the International Space Station (ISS) through the use of a miniaturized miniPCR system. Target sequences in plasmid, zebrafish genomic DNA, and bisulfite-treated DNA were successfully amplified under a variety of conditions. Methylation-specific primers differentially amplified bisulfite-treated samples as would be expected under standard laboratory conditions. Our findings establish proof of concept for targeted detection of DNA sequences during spaceflight and lay a foundation for future uses ranging from environmental monitoring to on-orbit diagnostics.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">On Earth, human health is continually improved by the use of molecular diagnostic techniques, however, these technologies remain largely untested in space conditions. It is well established that exposure to microgravity can result in profound impacts to the human body. For example, the human immune systemâs function is impacted in space, and may result in a decreased response to extracellular pathogens and an altered autoimmune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> In order to preserve the health of astronauts during long-duration space missions, it will be important to rapidly detect molecular changes such as alterations in gene expression and epigenetic modifications. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method to amplify DNA is routinely used on Earth to detect changes in DNA and gene expression and to diagnose infections among other applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> In this investigation, we sought to determine the conditions under which PCR can be carried out in microgravity to enable DNA analysis and to establish the basis for a PCR-based assay to monitor crewmember health during long-term missions. This student-led investigation resulted from the winning proposal of the first Genes in Space Competition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p>

              <title>Results and discussion</title>
              <p id="Par3">To test hardware performance and its capacity to amplify DNA under a variety of conditions in space, we conducted four runs in the miniPCR thermal cycler. The first ââdry runââ experiment, without biological samples, confirmed that the temperature profiles during thermal cycling were comparable to those obtained on Earth (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The second and third experiments were used to determine the baseline conditions for efficient DNA amplification, and the fourth experiment attempted to detect changes in DNA methylation patterns in genomic DNA. For each experiment duplicate reactions were prepared, stored under similar conditions, and amplified on Earth in parallel with those in the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
              <p id="Par4">The first experiment with a biological sample attempted to amplify plasmid DNA, as it provides a high-quality, low-complexity template that yields robust amplification on Earth. We conducted extensive stability studies of complete reactions on Earth and determined that reactions were viable after prolonged storage periods of at least 3 months (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), more than the time expected to lapse between sample preparation on Earth and operations at the ISS. ââCompleteââ reactions, including template DNA, primers, polymerase, deoxynucleotides and reaction buffer were prepared on Earth and launched frozen on an ISS National Lab mission to the ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Aboard the ISS, the miniPCR device was connected to the onboard computer in the maintenance work area (MWA) for the duration of the experiment and then stowed away for later use (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). To determine whether optimal conditions for PCR amplification differed in the ISS environment, we varied several experimental parameters. Changes in fluid dynamics such as reduced convection, and changes in surface tension in the ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> might impact heat transfer throughout samples and liquid distribution in the reaction vessels, potentially impacting amplification efficiency due to incomplete DNA denaturation, poor primer annealing, or reduced polymerase efficiency. To determine whether the altered fluid dynamics would impact DNA amplification, we prepared reactions in total volumes of 12.5, 25, and 50âÂµl, which span the range of volumes typically used in laboratories. We also varied the amount of template DNA between 0.1 and 10âng, and utilized two different DNA polymerases, <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase and Q5Â® polymerase. We found that DNA amplification in the ISS was successful under all experimental conditions tested (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), indicating that PCR can be conducted aboard the ISS without modification of standard protocols. Since the Genes in Space-1 studies were performed, two other independent efforts, NASA WetLab-2 and Water Monitoring Suite, have also amplified DNA aboard the ISS (unpublished).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Long-term stability studies. Complete reactions using Hot Start <italic>Taq</italic> (NEB) were prepared at the same time and stored at â80, â20, or 4âÂ°C for either 6 or 12 weeks as indicated. Samples were then thawed or removed from the fridge, amplified using PCR and run on a 1.5% agarose gel. ntc: no template control.

              <p id="Par5">It is becoming increasingly clear that altered epigenetic profiles can lead to a variety of disorders, and that spaceflight produces measurable changes to the epigenome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> An assay to evaluate epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation during spaceflight would aid our understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the epigenome and would allow monitoring of crewmembersâ health. For example, such an assay could aid in the detection of immune system alterations that may to lead to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease, allergies, and other diseases in space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> The standard method used to evaluate the methylation profile of DNA is bisulfite conversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> During bisulfite treatment unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil through deamination, while methylated cytosines are protected from the conversion. These resulting alterations can be revealed using primers specific to converted or non-converted sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> We sought to determine whether such epigenetic changes could be detected using PCR technology on the ISS through the use of methylation-specific primers. We used zebrafish embryos as an experimental system because its methylation patterns have been studied in detail at a genome-wide level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> We selected to study the promoters of <italic>Hoxb3a</italic>, a developmental gene, and <italic>Interleukin 4</italic> (<italic>IL4</italic>), an immune gene, as the methylation patterns for these genes have been shown to change in embryos between 0 and 6âh post-fertilization. DNA for each time point was prepared, divided and either left untreated or treated with sodium bisulfite. Complete amplification reactions to detect converted and non-converted DNA were prepared on Earth and sent frozen to ISS. PCR performed on untreated DNA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, lanes 2 and 3) resulted in robust amplification of <italic>IL4</italic> and <italic>Hox</italic> in space samples and ground controls. At 6 hpf <italic>IL4</italic> space-amplified samples with primers specific to sequences that were methylated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, top gel, lane 5) amplified more robustly than samples with primers specific to sequences that were not methylated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, top gel, lane 4). These results mirror the ones from samples amplified on Earth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, bottom gel, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that methylation-specific PCR can be conducted in space without modifications. Reactions targeting the Hox promoter that contained bisulfite-treated DNA resulted in poor amplification in both space samples and ground controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, lanes 6â9), likely due to the increased fragility of bisulfite-treated DNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par6">Taken together, our experiments reveal that PCR can be robustly carried out in a microgravity environment without adaptations to the hardware, consumables, or reagents, opening the door to DNA analysis in space. Additionally, we found that differences in DNA methylation are detectable in this microgravity environment. Furthering our ability to evaluate molecular changes in space is essential to both our understanding of the effects of spaceflight on the human body and the maintenance of astronaut health to enable long-term missions. Recent reports of DNA sequencing aboard the ISS using samples prepared on Earth,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> in combination with the successful on-orbit DNA amplification reported in this article, suggest that a complete sample-to-sequence DNA analysis workflow in space will be plausible in the near future.</p>

Parameters for thermal cycling were programmed by crew through the onboard computer and uploaded to the miniPCR via a USB cable. After upload the operations continued unattended. When the run was complete, the miniPCR data from the run was saved and all power was removed. After 30âmin to allow for cool down, the sample was removed from the miniPCR and placed back into an ISS freezer (GLACIER), where it stayed until loaded back into a Space X Dragon for return. Samples were returned in an unpowered coldbag that was held at +4âÂ°C via coldbricks. Upon splashdown, the vehicle was unloaded and the samples were put into a freezer for return toÂ the Johnson Space Center, then turned over to the Boeing team and packaged in Fedex cold storage shipper (ice packs) for return to miniPCR for final analysis.</p>
