                <p id="Par1">In order to screen out an effective bone loss protectant from natural plant polyphenol and to elucidate the mechanism of the plant polyphenols that alleviate bone loss under simulated microgravity, the proliferation activities of 9 total polyphenol extracts from natural product (TPENP) on osteoblasts were measured. Polyphenols (S3) was isolated from total polyphenols of cone scales from <italic>pinus koraiensis</italic> (Korean pine). ALP activity in osteoblasts and MDA level in femur were measured. Mechanical properties and microstructure of the distal cancellous region of the femur in rat were tested. Various bone metabolism markers, enzymes activity and genes expression were also analyzed. The results showed that S3 has the highest activity of osteoblast proliferation. S3 promoted ALP activity in osteoblasts, enhanced mechanical properties and microstructure of the distal cancellous region of femur in rat, decreased MDA level, elevated the serum concentration of BALP, PINP and activities of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px in femur under simulated microgravity. In addition, S3 enhanced the expression of NRF-2, β-catenin, p-GSK3-β, OSX, RUNX2, Osteonectin, Osteocalcin, ALP and collagen I. These results indicated that S3 can alleviated bone loss induced by simulated microgravity through abate the inhibition of the oxidative stress on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Bone loss which is characterized by unstable bone structure and reduced bone mass can be induced by long term spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Studies of the bone density of astronauts found that after long duration spaceflight, the cancellous bone formation of astronauts was reduced, bone metabolism was abnormal, and there were various degrees of bone mineral density and bone mineral loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. By marking the rat bone with tetracycline, the cortex and cancellous bone formation were found decreased after spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Unlike bone loss on ground, the occurrence and development of weightlessness bone loss has certain site selectivity, and the bone loss is difficult to recover after return to the ground<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, space medicine has been devoted to the study of effective protection against bone loss under microgravity. Based on the current theory, there are two ways to deal with bone loss in microgravity environment, one is to carry out resistance training, and the other is to do the drug intervention. But confrontational training equipment for alleviating bone loss caused by microgravity is weak, and chemical drug have serious side effects. Therefore, the search for effective bone loss protectants is one of the most important methods for human body to adapt to microgravity environment.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Plants are the main source of drugs for the treatment of various diseases, so more and more attention has been paid to the search for new powerful bone loss protectants from plants. Polyphenols are a group of compounds with similar chemical structure, and are structurally characterized by one and more than one phenolic hydroxyl unit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Polyphenols from natural plants have the characteristics of small dose and strong effect, diverse biological activity and etcetera. According to the characteristics of polyphenolic compounds, the plant polyphenols can be divided into phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and wood flour compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Current studies have shown that natural polyphenols have many physiological functions, including improved cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, effects on nervous system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, anti-inflammatory effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, significant anticancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and anti-aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, etc. The daily intake of a certain amount of natural polyphenols can effectively prevent and inhibit the occurrence of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, the polyphenols from natural plants has the potential to develop protectant for bone loss caused by a microgravity environment.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Studies have found that Pycnogenol® (extracts of <italic>Pinus pinaster Ait</italic>. bark) has the effect of anti-bone loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and its main component is plant polyphenols. <italic>Pinus koraiensis</italic> (Korean pine) and <italic>Pinus pinaster Ait</italic>. are both belongs to pinus lambertiana, so polyphenols in Korean pine have the potential to become a bone loss protectant. In <italic>The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China</italic>, most of the medicinal parts of the Korean pine were root, stem and bark, however, without records of the cone scale. Cone scales is considered a type of trash in the traditional concept and can be buried or burned. But, the degradation rate of landfill is slowly, while incineration will cause serious environmental pollution. Therefore, there is no appropriate method for handling the scales of Korean pine cone that had been considered as “junk” until now. If weightlessness bone loss protectant can be developed from cone scale of Korean pine, the problem of environmental pollution can be solved as killing two birds with one stone. Searching weightlessness bone loss protectant from polyphenols in natural plants is a new breakthrough relative to the current development of bone loss protectants. In this paper, study will be started with the obtaining protectant to alleviate bone loss under microgravity from polyphenols in scales of Korean pine cone.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Firstly, the research value of total polyphenol extract in scale of Korean pine cone will be determined through comparison of cone scale from Korean pine and herbs that were commonly used in clinic and medicinal &amp; edible in <italic>The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China</italic>, while the contribution to osteoblasts proliferation activity of the total polyphenol extracts shall be screened and studied, and the polyphenol section with the highest activity of osteoblasts proliferation should be searched through isolation and purification. Secondly, whether polyphenol section from cone scale of Korean pine can alleviate the decreased ALP activity in osteoblasts should be verified under simulated microgravity <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, so that whether the Korean pine polyphenols section had the potential capacity to alleviate bone loss caused by the microgravity can be preliminarily verified. Thirdly, <italic>in vivo</italic> study, whether the polyphenols section can alleviated bone loss induced by microgravity should be tested through the analysis of mechanical properties of femur and μ-CT scanning of cancellous of distal femur in rats, in order to obtain natural plant extracts that had the potential capacity to alleviate bone loss under microgravity. Finally, the mechanism that polyphenol section from Korean pine alleviated bone loss induced by simulated microgravity should be elucidated through biochemical indicators in serum and femur and the signaling pathways.</p>

                <p id="Par6">The number of osteoblast played a direct role in bone forming so the screening of proliferation activities of 9 total polyphenol extracts from natural product (TPENP) on osteoblasts was carried out first. Varying degrees of proliferation activity on osteoblasts were identified for 9 TPENP and The EC<sub>50</sub> values of proliferation activities of 9 TPENP on osteoblasts were showed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. EC<sub>50</sub> values were arranged in ascending order: Korean pine, Psoralen, Rehmannia, Morinda, Eucommia, Drynaria, Epimedium, Astragalus and Kudzu. The total polyphenols of Korean pine had the highest proliferation activity on osteoblasts through comparison of EC<sub>50</sub> values. So the Korean pine was selected for research in this study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of proliferation activities of 9 TPENP on osteoblasts.

                <title>Isolation and purification of total polyphenols of Korean pine and comparison of proliferation activities of S3, S4 on osteoblasts</title>
                <p id="Par7">In order to screen out compounds with similar chemical structure that promote osteoblasts proliferation, total polyphenols of Korean pine were isolated and purificated for this study. With the increasing volume of elution, the content of polyphenols in the eluent increased first at 1/2 Column volume and then decreased at 3/4 Column volume (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In column chromatography elution, each 1/4 column volume of eluent was counted as one section, so the total polyphenol of Korean pine was divided into eight sections of S1–S8, and the content of polyphenols in S3 was the highest, (9.54 ± 0.39 mg/ml), and S4 followed (6.23 ± 0.22 mg/ml), while polyphenols in the remaining section were less than 0.6 mg/ml (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). This data indicated that the polyphenols isolated from Korean pine that promote osteoblasts proliferation were mainly in S3 and S4, while the main components in other sections were not polyphenols. Therefore, the abilities of S3 and S4 to promote the proliferation of osteoblasts were compared. The concentration of S3 and S4 of highest relative proliferation rate of osteoblasts was 16 μg/ml and 60 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The comparison of EC<sub>50</sub> value showed that the proliferation activity of S3 on osteoblasts was better than S4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), so S3 was selected for further research.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Isolation and purification of total polyphenols in cone scale of Korean pine and comparison of proliferation activities of S3, S4 on osteoblasts.

              <p id="Par15">Bone loss is the result of disruption in homeostasis between osteogenesis of osteoblasts and bone resorption of osteoclasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The mostly current clinical drugs treat bone loss through inhibiting the differentiation or activity of osteoclasts which make bone homeostasis to the direction of bone formation. However, the medicines developed in this way have serious side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Osteoblasts have proliferative ability, while osteoclasts are terminally differentiated cells and lose proliferative ability. And osteoblasts live longer than osteoclasts. Compared with osteoclasts, osteoblasts have been better potential drug target for bone loss treatment because of their biological properties. Therefore, osteoblasts were selected as the target, and the potential ability to be bone loss protectant was evaluated through the screening of proliferation activities of 9 TPENP on osteoblasts. This study differ from the medicine research and development ideas that inhibiting the differentiation or activity of osteoclast, but focus on the enhancement of osteogenesis of osteoblasts to achieve the restoration of bone homeostasis, and as a basis for the development of bone loss protectants in promote bone formation way. Through comparing the proliferation activity of 9 TPENP on osteoblasts, we found that cone scales of Korean pine has the most proliferation activity on osteoblast under the same dry weight, which showed that if the same activity is achieved, the use of the cone scales of Korean pine is less than the other 8 herbs. This result indicates that scales of Korean pine cone have had a stronger ability to alleviate bone loss compared to the herbs commonly used in <italic>The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China</italic>. The result also showed that the cone scales of Korean pine have potential application value and research value.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Current studies have found that the biological activity of TPENP would increase with purity increase through isolation and purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In order to obtain compounds with similar chemical structure and high osteoblast proliferation activity from the total polyphenols of Korean pine, total polyphenols were isolated and purificated by macroporous resin and proliferation activity of the purified on osteoblasts was tested. Previous study has shown that macroporous resin had a good separation and purification effect on the bioactive substance in polyphenols of Korean pine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this study, the results showed that macroporous resin had good enrichment effect on polyphenols of Korean pine as a result of the column chromatography elution curve showed a sharp peak. Through the total polyphenols of Korean pine was divided into eight sections from S1 to S8, this paper discovered that S3 and S4 have higher polyphenol content while the polyphenol content in the rest of 6 sections was almost negligible, which can be concluded that compounds with osteoblast proliferation activity in total polyphenols of Korean pine are present in S3 or S4. Comparing with the EC<sub>50</sub> value of the proliferation activity of S3 and S4 on osteoblasts, this paper further found that the section which had strongest proliferation activity in the total polyphenol extracts of scales from Korean pine cone was S3, and in other words, the compounds with proliferative activity of osteoblasts was mainly from S3.</p>
              <p id="Par17">In order to confirm whether S3 has the potential ability to alleviate bone loss induced by microgravity, the effect of S3 on ALP activity in osteoblasts under SMG was studied first. The results showed that the decreased ALP activity in osteoblasts induced by simulated microgravity was elevated significantly by S3 <italic>in vitro</italic> and present a dose-dependent manner. Then, the effects of S3 on mechanical properties of femur and cancellous in rat distal femur after HLS were studied. The results showed that the decreased mechanical properties of the femur and the changed cancellous of distal femur in rat caused by HLS were alleviated by S3 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, studies <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> have demonstrated that S3 has the potential to alleviate bone loss under microgravity.</p>
              <p id="Par18">To investigate the mechanism of S3 in alleviating bone loss in rats under simulated microgravity, bone metabolites in rat serum were firstly tested. The results of BALP, PIPN, TRAP-5b and NTX suggest that bone loss induced by HLS was alleviated by S3 may through enhancing bone formation capacity but without inhibiting bone resorption. Secondly, in order to comfirm whether unbalanced bone homeostasis after HLS was alleviated by S3 through promoting osteogenesis of osteoblasts without inhibiting bone resorption of osteoclasts, the OPG/RANK/RANKL signaling pathway was tested in rat femur. OPG/RANK/RANKL signaling pathway is an important pathway to regulate osteoclast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The results showed that S3 had no significant effect on OPG/RANKL which means S3 does not play a role in alleviating the bone loss after HLS in rats by affecting the OPG/RANK/RANKL signaling pathway. In other words, bone resorption could not be inhibited by S3 through the suppressing differentiation and activity of osteoclasts. Current study found that bone loss was caused by bone formation decreased or bone resorption enhanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Therefore these results inferred that bone loss was alleviated by S3 after HLS through promoting osteogenesis of osteoblasts way.</p>
              <p id="Par19">Bone loss is usually accompanied by oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, and many experiments have confirmed that the level of oxidative stress was increased under space flight in body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. To further investigate the mechanism of S3 in alleviating bone loss in rats under simulated microgravity, the levels of oxidative stress in rat femur after HLS was tested first. The MDA results showed that increased level of oxidative stress was reduced significantly by S3. Although current study found that astronauts in space mission were subjected to oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and studies in animals also found that space flight reduced the antioxidant capacity of rat liver and promoted the development of oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition to microgravity, there are also strong radiations in space environment, and studies have shown that oxidative damage could cause by radiation that induced high levels of free radical in body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. This environment in space is not the same as the microgravity effects in this study. However, in addition to elevated levels of free radicals in the body, the oxidative damage may also be caused by decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, the activity of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px which is the key enzyme in antioxidant defense enzyme system in rat femur was detected. The results indicated that the function of the antioxidant defense enzyme system in femur decreased after HLS, which caused the increase of MDA. The expression of many enzymes in antioxidant defense enzyme system are needed the activation of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway which Nrf-2 is a key regulator in body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The results of Nrf-2 expression indicated that the suppression of Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway was alleviated by S3. In this study, S3 contains polyphenolic compounds with a large number of catechin and quercetin, which molecular structure contains a large amount of covalent bonds. The larger p-π conjugated system is formed by the sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization of most of these covalent bonds, and this electron-deficient center can often make the molecule have antioxidant ability. When the femur is suffered oxidative stress, the ortho phenolic group carried by catechin and quercetin is oxidized to ortho quinone structure which can alter the conformation of Keap1 by binding, thereby the expression of many downstream target genes are induced by released Nrf-2. In addition, the expression of Nrf-2 is promoted by the flavonoid structure in catechin and quercetin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In conclusion, oxidative stress is alleviated by S3 in femur through increasing the activity of the antioxidant defense enzyme system.</p>
              <p id="Par20">Current studies have found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway which played a central role in the regulation of bone remodeling could be inhibited by oxidative stress in many different cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. To further investigate the mechanism of S3 in alleviating bone loss in rats under simulated microgravity, β-catenin, GSK3β and p-GSK3β in femur were tested first. The result indicated that the degradation of β-catenin caused by down regulation of p-GSK3β failed to enter the nucleus, resulting in the decreased expression of key osteogenesis gene was alleviated by S3 after HLS. In other words, the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was alleviated by S3 under simulated microgravity. Secondly, decreased expression of RNUX2 and OSX which can promote the differentiation and maturation of osteoblasts, and make bone homeostasis towards to osteogenesis way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, and Osteonectin, Osteocalcin, Collagen I α1 and ALP which play an important role during collagen bonding and mineralization in bone formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> were significantly elevated by S3 after HLS. These results proved that the decreased collagen formation and mineralization of bone can be alleviated by S3 in rat under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p id="Par21">Oxidative stress level was increased, and the transduction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited under simulated microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. But the relationship between oxidative stress and transduction of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in bone under microgravity has not been clarified till now. Notably, many studies on ground have shown that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited by oxidative stress. But due to many signaling pathways changed under simulated microgravity, the conclusion cannot be drawn that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited by oxidative stress. The results of this study showed that, first, oxidative stress induced by simulated microgravity could be alleviated by S3 in femur of rat, second the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was alleviated by S3, third, bone loss could alleviated by S3. Current research found that aging and menopause induced bone loss can be alleviated by catechin and quercetin which was contained in S3. However, reports that Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated by catechin and quercetin in bone has not been found yet. This suggests that S3 does not alleviate bone loss by simply activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in rats under simulated microgravity. From this, the conclusion can be drawn that simulated microgravity results in oxidative stress in femur, which inhibits the transduction of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and ultimately leads to bone loss. Thus it can be seen that S3 exert a role in alleviating bone loss due to ortho phenolic group which significantly alleviate the antagonism of oxidative stress to Keap1 and flavonoid structure which significantly promote the expression of Nrf-2 that alleviate the inhibition of oxidative stress on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway under simulated microgravity by enhancing antioxidant enzyme system capacity through activate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway.</p>
              <p id="Par22">From the presentation above, it can be concluded below. 1. S3 whom had the highest proliferation activity on osteoblasts was found through isolation and purification from the polyphenol extracts of scales of Korean pine cone which had the highest proliferation activity on osteoblasts by compared with 8 kinds of herbs which commonly used in clinic and medicinal &amp; edible in <italic>The Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China</italic>. 2.

The medicinal value of cone scales of Korean pine has been developed, and a new approach for developing the protectants for bone loss in microgravity has been provided in this study.</p>

After mix for 5 minutes, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (1.0 mL, 10% (w/v)) and distilled water (1 ml) was added. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature without light for 2 hours. Distilled water was used for control instead of the sample solution. Spectrophotometer (analytikjena, Germany) was used to measure the absorption value (760 nm) of mixtures. Gallic acid (0–70 μg/mL) was used as the standard solution to make the standard curve (see Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The regression equation was y = 0.01222x + 0.012256 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9991, n = 6). In this equation, y is the absorption value of gallic acid and x is the concentration (μg/mL). Concentration of polyphenol could be figured out by the regression equation and the dilution multiple of sample solution.</p>
