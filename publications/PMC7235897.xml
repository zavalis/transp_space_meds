                <p>In the ‘Rocket Science’ project, storage of <italic>Eruca sativa</italic> (salad rocket) seeds for six months on board the International Space Station resulted in delayed seedling establishment. Here we investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms underpinning the spaceflight effects on dry seeds. We found that ‘Space’ seed germination vigor was reduced, and ageing sensitivity increased, but the spaceflight did not compromise seed viability and the development of normal seedlings. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes (using RNAseq) in dry seeds and upon controlled artificial ageing treatment (CAAT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with spaceflight and ageing. DEG categories enriched by spaceflight and CAAT included transcription and translation with reduced transcript abundances for 40S and 60S ribosomal subunit genes. Among the ‘spaceflight-up’ DEGs were heat shock proteins (HSPs), DNAJ-related chaperones, a heat shock factor (<italic>HSFA7a-like</italic>), and components of several DNA repair pathways (e.g., <italic>ATM</italic>, <italic>DNA ligase 1</italic>). The ‘response to radiation’ category was especially enriched in ‘spaceflight-up’ DEGs including HSPs, catalases, and the transcription factor <italic>HY5</italic>. The major finding from the physiological and transcriptome analysis is that spaceflight causes vigor loss and partial ageing during air-dry seed storage, for which space environmental factors and consequences for seed storage during spaceflights are discussed.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Plant science research during spaceflight, including on orbiting space platforms such as the International Space Station (ISS), has revealed novel mechanisms and the potential of ‘dry’ seeds, growing seedlings, and flowering plants to respond to environmental change and extreme conditions outside their evolutionary history [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These findings are relevant for sustainable agriculture, climate change, food security, and seed storage on the Earth’s surface, as well as for growing fresh food during long-distance space travel and for agriculture on Mars and other planets [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B6-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Laboratories inside spaceships in low Earth orbit (LEO) have enabled investigations of the effects of long-term microgravity and helped, for example, to unravel mechanisms underpinning plant tropisms that would otherwise be masked by the effects of gravitropism [<xref rid="B2-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B9-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Molecular analysis of growing seedlings and adult plants in microgravity by epigenomics [<xref rid="B10-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], transcriptomics, and proteomics [<xref rid="B8-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] identified known and novel genes specific for the response to the space environment. This research has potential to be applied to growing fresh food derived from plants for nutrition and human survival in space during long-distance space travel [<xref rid="B5-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B7-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These works demonstrated that successful ‘seed-to-seed’ plant cultivation and propagation is possible but also that space-produced seeds may differ in reserve composition and properties. Long-term exposure to microgravity inside spaceships also led to the important discovery that it is associated with accelerated ageing of humans and plants [<xref rid="B4-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>In many organisms, including most plants, the passage through arrested life stages is associated with desiccation tolerance, the ability to survive extreme water losses by expressing protection mechanisms for the low-hydrated tissues and macromolecules in the ‘air-dry’ state [<xref rid="B18-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Plant species with desiccation tolerance of vegetative tissues (usually 80–90% water content) are rare, yet it is common in plant seeds, which in their dry state have 5–10% water content. Low ambient humidity and low temperature are the recommended long-term dry storage conditions for desiccation-tolerant plant seeds in ex situ seed banks and seed company warehouses. Crop seed quality is compromised by ageing during seed storage, which initially manifests as reduced seed vigor (germination performance) and subsequently as reduced seed viability (seed death). Seed ageing during storage is caused by oxidation of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, etc.) leading to progressive deterioration [<xref rid="B20-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The ability to repair accumulated oxidative damage during seed imbibition (antioxidant systems, DNA ligases, etc.) and the biochemical, biomechanical, and micromorphological properties of the protecting seed and fruit coat layers are important determinants of seed quality [<xref rid="B18-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B25-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Viability loss is a late response during dry storage preceded by vigor loss due to ageing processes. The use of controlled artificial ageing assays provided insight into the molecular processes underpinning the loss of seed vigor and viability.</p>
              <p>A number of studies have investigated seed viability during long-term exposure to the harsh space environment without and with shielding against space radiation [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B28-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Arabidopsis) and tobacco seed lots exposed for &gt;&gt;1 year to the outside space of the ISS (LEO ~450 km altitude, temperatures fluctuating between −25 and 50 °C, vacuum 10<sup>−4</sup> to 10<sup>−7</sup> Pa, space radiation absorbed dose 350–400 mGy) showed delayed germination (reduced germination speed), but with ~90% viability when shielded from short-wavelength ultraviolet (UV) radiation (&gt;1 GJ m<sup>−2</sup> UV<sub>110–400 nm</sub>) [<xref rid="B30-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When exposed unshielded, the short-wavelength UV radiation caused a severe reduction in seed lot viability. Ground simulation (room temperature, normal pressure (10<sup>5</sup> Pa), 1−3 µGy day<sup>−1</sup>) confirmed that ~1 GJ m<sup>−2</sup> UV<sub>254 nm</sub> is indeed a lethal dose for Arabidopsis and tobacco seeds but not for field bindweed seeds, which have a hard seed coat with phenolic pigments potentially providing the protective shielding against the UV radiation. The finding that shielding against short-wavelength UV radiation retains viability was also found to be true for dry seeds of other plant species and for desiccation-tolerant bacterial and fungal spores; also, there seem to be species-specific differences in the self-shielding properties by phenolic pigments in seed and spore coats (see review and original references in [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). The delay observed in Arabidopsis seed germination depended upon spacecraft position, probably owing to differences in radiation, with positions that were more shielded resulting in effects of lesser intensity [<xref rid="B32-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Long-term exposure of cereal grains (rice, wheat, barley, corn) to the outer space environment with different degrees of shielding confirmed in principle their viability and capability to produce healthy seedlings. However, specific molecular damage by the space environment also occurred in the cereals and resulted in delayed and reduced germination [<xref rid="B33-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], reduced photosynthetic performance of seedlings [<xref rid="B34-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and spaceflight-induced mutations affecting stress tolerance genes [<xref rid="B35-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The best shielding for crop seed transport during long-distance space travel therefore seems to be seed storage inside spaceships. </p>
              <p>On 2 September 2015, 2 kg of rocket seeds (<italic>Eruca sativa</italic>) were sent to LEO aboard Soyuz TMA-18M to spend six months on board the ISS, returning to Earth on 2 March 2016, as part of the ‘Rocket Science’ project [<xref rid="B36-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This project was initiated by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) in collaboration with the UK Space Agency and supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) with the British astronaut Tim Peake. It involved over 5000 schools in the UK who undertook set experiments to determine if the spaceflight affected germination and seedling establishment. The results of the experiments undertaken by schools suggested that spaceflight may cause a minor delay in seedling emergence and growth [<xref rid="B36-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The seed samples also represented a unique opportunity to investigate the subtle effects of seed storage alongside human spaceflight (i.e., seed stored inside pressurized cabins) on germination physiology and the seed transcriptome. Here we investigate the effects of this spaceflight, which included six months on board the ISS, on the germination physiology, dry seed transcriptome, and response to controlled artificial ageing treatment (CAAT) of rocket seeds.</p>

Company warehouse storage of this seed lot was at 14 °C with a relative humidity (RH) of 25% in foil bags. Three seed batches originating from this seed lot were used in our experimental work (depicted as flow chart in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S1</xref>): (1) The seed batch ‘Earth-WS (Warehouse Stock)’ was directly taken from this seed lot stored in the described warehouse conditions (14 °C, 25% RH, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S1</xref>). The Earth-WS seed batch therefore provides a ground control which remained in the warehouse storage and therefore directly represents the original seed lot (no space journey, no packaging process).

In this packaging process, individual foil packets (red) were filled with 100 seeds each (Seed Packers Ltd., Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, IP32 6NL, UK). (3) The seed batch ‘Space’ underwent the space journey (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S1</xref>) and subsequently the same packaging process in March 2016 to provide individual foil packets (blue).

                <p>For the space journey (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S1</xref>), Space seed were transported in the sealed foil bags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) by airplane from London (UK) to Baikonur (Kazakhstan) via Noordwijk (Netherlands) and Moscow (Russia) in August 2015. The transport was at room temperature (18–25 °C), but as no temperature datalogger was used, we cannot exclude occasional fluctuations beyond this temperature range. Space seeds were launched aboard Soyuz 44S (air temperature on board 18–25 °C) to the ISS on 2nd September 2015. Space seeds were stored for six months inside the ISS (with an average temperature of 22 to 23 °C and occasional fluctuations between 18 and 32 °C), and the location within the space station changed; the seeds were stored most of the time in the Columbus laboratory and occasionally were removed for photographs (still sealed within foil bags, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Space seeds boarded the Soyuz capsule on 2nd March 2016 for re-entry to Earth, landing on the Kazakh Steppe. Seeds were transported to London (UK) by airplane via Moscow (Russia), Stavanger (Norway), and Houston (USA) and underwent the packaging process in the UK starting 14 March 2016. The sealed foil bag during the space journey was to maintain humidity (low), air composition, and pressure throughout. Moisture content was determined by drying 100 mg of seed in glass vials using a drying oven for 17 h at 103 °C and reweighing. Dry storage of the seeds in red and blue foil bags in the Seed Science Laboratory at Royal Holloway University of London was at 22 °C in a sealed plastic container above silica gel (generating &lt;15% RH). Conductivity assays were conducted in May 2016, CAAT assays took place January–April 2017, and RNA extraction for the transcriptome analysis was in May 2017. Germination assays were conducted throughout the dry storage period and consistently demonstrated that the Space seeds germinated slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

                <title>3.2. Effect of Controlled Artificial Ageing on Earth and Space Seed Germination</title>
                <p>Due to the delay in germination observed, it was hypothesized that the Space seeds may have experienced an environment that slightly accelerated ageing-related processes. The effect of the controlled artificial ageing treatment (CAAT) on germination was therefore analyzed on all three seed batches: Earth-WS, Earth, and Space seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The CAAT involved incubating seeds equilibrated at 70% RH for a defined number of days at 35 °C. Subsequently, they were dried back over silica beads, and their responses were compared in germination assays at 20 °C. Again, when imbibed at 20 °C without CAAT, the Space seeds germinated slightly slower than the Earth-WS and Earth seed batches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>A <italic>top panel</italic>), on average reaching 50% germination 1.1 h later. When artificial ageing was applied, 15 days of CAAT increased the time to reach 50% germination (t<sub>50%</sub>) of Earth-WS and Earth seed batches by 34.4 and 26.6 h, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>A <italic>bottom panel</italic>). However, the t<sub>50%</sub> of the Space seed batch was most affected by the 15 day CAAT, being increased by 46.4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>A <italic>bottom panel</italic>). The Space seed batch was already significantly more susceptible to CAAT at eight days of CAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The dose effect reveals that increasing CAAT duration decreased the germination rates GR<sub>50%</sub>, with Space seeds being more sensitive compared to Earth and Earth-WS seeds. For Space seeds, the t<sub>50%</sub> was 1.2, 2.7, 9.5, and 21 h longer than for the Earth seeds following 0, 4, 8, and 15 days of CAAT treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Thus, the difference in germination kinetics between earthbound seeds and space-flown seeds is augmented following the CAAT. The higher ageing sensitivity of the Space seeds was evident in a reduced speed of germination.</p>
                <p>Seed ageing during storage reduces seed quality initially by reducing the vigor (speed and uniformity of germination) and only subsequently by reducing the viability of a seed population [<xref rid="B58-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Consistent with a loss in seed quality due to enhanced ageing, the Space seeds were reduced in their germination speed but not affected in their viability as evident from the retained maximum germination percentage of 95–100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f002">Figure 2</xref>). To further investigate the seed ageing, we employed an electrical conductivity (EC) vigor assay to compare leakage of solutes from seeds during imbibition [<xref rid="B38-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S4</xref> demonstrates a significantly higher EC for Space seeds as compared to Earth seeds. At 24 h soaking time, the Space seed EC was ~1.3-fold higher. This finding further supports our conclusion that the Rocket Science space travel with six months on board the ISS has caused a reduction in seed vigor, with reduced speed of germination and increased ageing sensitivity, but without affecting seed viability. </p>

                <title>3.3. Overall Effect of Spaceflight and Controlled Accelerated Ageing on the Seed Transcriptomes</title>
                <p>In light of the effects of spaceflight on seed germination kinetics, the transcriptomes of Space and ground control (Earth and Earth-WS) seed batches were investigated to see if transcript abundance changes may suggest mechanisms by which spaceflight caused the reduced germination vigor and increased the ageing sensitivity. Further, because the difference between germination of the ground control and Space seed batches was largest following 15 days CAAT, their transcriptomes upon ageing were comparatively investigated. This revealed potential ageing-related processes involved in the effect of spaceflight and allowed determination of whether the ageing response of space-flown seeds differs to ground control seeds. Thus, the transcriptomes of the three seed batches (Space, Earth, Earth-WS), ‘dry seed’ without or with 15 days CAAT, were comparatively analyzed (six treatments, each with three replicates). </p>
                <p>Because the <italic>E. sativa</italic> genome was not available, a de novo assembly was used as a reference for transcript quantification. Following filtering steps, the expression results for 26,234 transcripts were obtained and are accessible via the Rocket Science Gene Expression Viewer (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Data File</xref>); detailed instructions for using the Expression Viewer are described (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Instructions</xref>). One sample, Space—dry seed replicate 2, was removed from the analysis as it was a clear outlier (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S5</xref>). The PCA of transcript expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) indicated that ageing affected the transcriptomes. The first principle component, associated with the CAAT treatment, accounted for 20% of the variance in transcript expression. The second principle component was not associated with a specific treatment, although the Earth-WS and Earth seeds were separated along this axis, perhaps indicating that this 8% of the variance might be in part associated with the packing and storage element experienced by the Earth and Space seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,y). The three seed batches appeared to be transcriptomically more similar following 15 days CAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,x). Interestingly, the Space seed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,z) were located between the Earth dry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,y) and the aged seed groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,x). Thus, we speculated that the spaceflight may have a partial ageing effect on the dry seed transcriptome.</p>
                <p>To investigate the genes which contribute to the transcriptomic differences between the treatments, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pairwise comparisons of treatments were identified using NOISeqBIO (<xref rid="life-10-00049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In general, the CAAT induced the most changes in the transcriptomes (2810, 2532, 1859 DEGs in Earth-WS, Earth, Space seeds, respectively). There was a modest overlap in DEGs due to the CAAT across all three seed batches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), with 453 genes consistently induced and 153 repressed by the ageing treatment. A number of genes were also consistent DEGs in two out of the three CAAT comparisons, meaning 42% of all identified DEGs due to CAAT were consistent in at least two seed batches, and 13% were consistent in all three seed batches. The two ground control seed batches shared 45% of DEGs due to CAAT. Overall this indicated that there were consistent effects of CAAT on the transcriptomes, but also seed batch-specific effects. The effects of packaging and spaceflight on the transcriptomes on the dry seed were overall less pronounced than the effects of CAAT (<xref rid="life-10-00049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Space and packaging, i.e., Space vs. Earth-WS resulted in the most DEGs in comparisons of dry seed (1313). Packaging of Earth (seed storage at ~22 °C) vs. nonpackaged Earth-WS (seed storage at 14 °C) seeds resulted in 942 DEGs in dry seeds. Because Earth and Earth-WS seeds were both not aged and did not differ in ageing sensitivity, we did not focus on these genes in this publication. Space alone, i.e., Earth vs. Space, resulted in 773 DEGs. The differences amongst the seed lots following CAAT were the smallest, with the largest difference in CAAT seed still maintained between Space and Earth-WS with 388 DEGs (<xref rid="life-10-00049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The Space and Earth seed batches were relatively very similar following CAAT, with only 44 DEGs between Space CAAT and Earth CAAT treatments. It is also evident in the trends of PCA that the CAAT aged seeds are more similar to each other and that CAAT has a fairly consistent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p>
                <p>Notably, Space seeds exhibited fewer DEGs than the ground control (Earth, Earth-WS) seeds following CAAT treatment (<xref rid="life-10-00049-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and the Space samples lie between the CAAT aged seeds and the dry ground control seeds in the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), again suggesting a potential overlap between the effect of space and ageing on the transcriptome. Indeed, it was found that 73% of DEGs due to spaceflight (Earth dry vs. Space dry) were also amongst the DEGs due to ageing of Earth seed, although conversely only 22% of the DEGs due to CAAT were represented in DEGs due to space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). This was indicative that the effect of spaceflight can be explained in part by ageing effects, but that the seeds may only be partially aged, and also that there are some space-specific effects not explained by ageing. To confirm that the effect of spaceflight was consistent with ageing, it was compared to the consistent effect of CAAT (seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>B with the red outline) on both Earth and Earth-WS seed batches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). In this case, seed ageing could explain 46% of space-induced DEGs, and space-induced DEGs represented 24% of seed ageing DEGs. This reinforced the hypothesis that the space-effect on the transcriptome may in part reflect a partial seed ageing effect which may explain the observed seed responses. </p>

                <title>3.4. Functional Gene Groups Associated with Transcriptome Changes during Ageing and Spaceflight</title>
                <p>To determine the general functional classes of genes associated with ageing and space-induced transcriptome changes, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Similar to the overlap seen with CAAT and spaceflight-induced DEGs, there was also overlap in the functional categories associated with genes up- and downregulated by spaceflight and CAAT. In particular, terms associated with translation are enriched in both genes that are less expressed following ageing (‘Down in CAAT’) and genes that are less expressed following spaceflight (‘Down in Space’), as shown in cluster I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>‘Down’ indicated by arrows</italic>). However, some terms were more strongly associated with a reduction in gene expression following either spaceflight or ageing. For example, terms in cluster II such as ‘seed oilbody biogenesis’ were more associated with a reduction in gene expression following CAAT. On the other hand, the term gene expression and others in cluster III were more associated with a reduction in expression following spaceflight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Conversely, some GO terms were associated with upregulation following both spaceflight and CAAT (clusters IV and V), including terms such as ‘response to heat’ and ‘protein folding’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>‘Up’ indicated by arrows</italic>). For the GO term ‘response to osmotic stress’ in cluster V the pattern was a bit more complicated, as this GO term was enriched in both genes that were associated with an increase in expression and genes that were associated with a decrease in expression following CAAT. This suggests that a number of genes belonging to this GO term category were induced by CAAT and a number of other genes belonging to this GO term category were repressed by CAAT. Cluster VI represented GO terms that were mostly associated with genes that increased in expression only following spaceflight and included terms such as ‘response to stress’, ‘response to light’, and ‘response to radiation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Alternatively, Cluster VII was associated with genes that increased in expression only following CAAT, including the terms ‘mRNA processing’ and ‘protein targeting to chloroplast’. Thus, it was possible to see that there were similarities in the functional annotations of genes that were upregulated or downregulated in spaceflight or following CAAT, suggesting that in part the changes may be as a result of the same mechanism. However, some functional annotations were associated more specifically with spaceflight or with CAAT, suggesting that different mechanisms may also be involved in the two processes. </p>

                <title>3.5. Processes Affected at the Transcript Abundance Level by Ageing and Spaceflight</title>
                <p>To investigate the processes highlighted by the transcriptome analysis in more detail, we assessed a number of DEGs with described functions belonging to the identified GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). One of the most prominent signals seen in the data was the change in abundance of transcripts encoding translational machinery, particularly those related to the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits. In agreement with the identification of enrichment of the GO term ‘translation’ for the Down groups in CAAT and Space DEG lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>), transcripts encoding proteins of the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits were significantly less abundant in CAAT-treated seeds and were lower in Space dry seeds compared to the ground control (Earth, Earth-WS) dry seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Further, the effect of ageing, for example on the 60S-related transcripts, decreases in Space seeds from 19% and 10% CAAT-induced decreases in Earth-WS and Earth seeds, respectively, to a 5% CAAT-induced decrease in Space seeds (in terms of summed transcripts). The same trend is observed in the 40S-related transcripts. This pattern reflects well the position of the Space dry seed in between Earth dry and CAAT aged seeds in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The GO term ‘gene expression’ was identified as being more specifically enriched in the DEGs Down group for Space seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
                <p>Some of these DEGs for this GO term encode transcription factors, such as <italic>RAP2.3,</italic> which follows a similar trend in decreasing due to CAAT and spaceflight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>). However, components of the transcription machinery are sometimes expressed in a contrary manner. For example, the transcripts encoding subunits of the general transcription factor TFIID, such as <italic>TFIID subunit 1</italic>, were induced by CAAT and spaceflight following the opposite pattern to the ribosomal subunits and <italic>RAP2.3</italic>. Transcripts encoding TFIID subunits 2, 6, 9-like, and 11 were also upregulated (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Data File</xref>). Thus, some elements of gene expression machinery appear to be induced by spaceflight and CAAT, whilst others are repressed. Another element of gene expression, RNA processing, was a GO term identified as being significantly enriched in CAAT-induced DEGs (but not space-induced DEGs), indicating an ageing process that is not as represented in the hypothesized ‘space ageing’ process. Amongst the ‘RNA processing’ GO term genes induced by CAAT were the pre-mRNA splicing proteins DOT2 and four DEAHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref rid="B59-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Their expression was only significantly affected by the CAAT treatment, and not by spaceflight, although there was a slight tendency for elevated <italic>DEAH</italic> expression in dry Space seeds compared to Earth seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
                <p>Stress response processes were also identified as being important in the CAAT and spaceflight-induced DEGs, including the GO terms ‘response to heat’ and ‘protein folding’. Indeed, a number of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and chaperones [<xref rid="B11-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B60-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] were found to have elevated expression in CAAT aged samples, and in space-flown samples, including <italic>HSP90-2-like, HSP90-1</italic>, <italic>class III HSP</italic>, <italic>JJJ1</italic>, and several <italic>DNAJ</italic>-related transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and other HSPs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Data File</xref>). For example, <italic>HSP90-1</italic> expression was increased by 53%, 74%, and 38% in CAAT treated Earth-WS, Earth, and Space seeds, respectively. Space seeds had 23% more <italic>HSP90-1</italic> and 31% more <italic>HSP90-2-like</italic> transcripts than Earth seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Again, the lesser effect of ageing on expression of <italic>HSP90-1</italic> and <italic>HSP90-2-like</italic> in space-flown seeds reflects the position (in the PCA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) of space-flown dry seeds as being between dry and CAAT seeds. Roles of HSPs in spaceflight responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>, [<xref rid="B11-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B60-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]) are further supported by heat shock factor transcript expression patterns, including <italic>HSFA7a-like</italic> in Space seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>) and <italic>HSFA2</italic> [<xref rid="B11-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>

                <title>3.6. Expression of DNA Repair Related Pathways Following Ageing and Spaceflight</title>
                <p>One of the potential mechanisms by which spaceflight and ageing may affect seed physiology is through DNA damage. Transcripts annotated with the GO term ‘response to radiation’ were significantly enriched in genes upregulated in Space seeds particularly, and to a lesser extent by CAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This GO term included some genes involved in repairing damage to DNA due to ionizing radiation, such as UV. We thus checked if there was evidence of differentially expressed DNA damage repair mechanisms following space and ageing treatments. DEGs were identified in the double-strand break (DSB) repair, nucleotide excision repair (NER), and photoreactivation-related (PR) DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Data File</xref>). In the DSB repair pathway, the DSB signal initiation related <italic>ATM</italic> [<xref rid="B25-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B62-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="B63-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] was a DEG elevated by CAAT in the Earth samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with partial ageing by the spaceflight (see PCA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), <italic>ATM</italic> transcript abundances were higher in dry Space seeds compared to the ground controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>ATR</italic> transcripts exhibited a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Data File</xref>). <italic>Ku80</italic>, <italic>XRCC4</italic>, and <italic>RAD51</italic> of the DSB repair pathway [<xref rid="B25-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B63-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] were induced by CAAT, especially in Earth-WS seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>DNA ligase 1</italic> (<italic>LIG1</italic>) also functions in DSB repair, as well as in other pathways, including the base excision repair (BER) pathway [<xref rid="B25-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B66-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. <italic>LIG1</italic> was significantly induced by CAAT by ca. 35% in all seed batches and was also 14% higher in Space as compared to Earth dry seed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). </p>

Mismatch repair and BER related genes were generally not found to be affected by ageing or spaceflight, with the exception of the aforementioned <italic>LIG1,</italic> which is also involved in BER. On the whole, transcripts encoding other parts of pathways involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification (e.g., transcripts encoding glutathione reductase, glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, ascorbate reductase, and sulfoxide reductase) [<xref rid="B71-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] were not generally induced by CAAT or spaceflight (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Supplementary Data File</xref>).

                <p>In the Rocket Science project, a spaceflight including six months on board the ISS in low Earth orbit (LEO) had a subtle, but significant, effect in delaying germination of rocket seeds, consistent with the observations of over 5000 schools across the UK, which also reported lower seedling survival in space-flown seeds at 17 days and reduced seedling height at 21 days [<xref rid="B36-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The major finding in our experiments is that the spaceflight caused partial seed ageing that reduced the seed vigor, as manifested in reduced germination rate (speed), increased solute leakage upon soaking, and increased sensitivity to controlled artificial ageing treatment (CAAT), but the spaceflight did not affect seed viability (maximal germination percentage) of the seed population. Our transcriptome analysis of dry seeds and seeds subjected to CAAT revealed footprints of the observed partial seed ageing caused by the spaceflight in that defined pathways and marker genes were affected. Space environmental factors potentially affecting seeds and seedlings include microgravity; different types radiation, such as galactic cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and short-wavelength UV; atmospheres with distinct gas composition including the lack of oxygen; low pressure and low humidity in extreme vacuum causing ultradrying; extreme temperature fluctuations; and mechanical vibration during spaceflight [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B11-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B74-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. While our experimental setup did not explicitly allow discrimination of the individual environmental factors that caused the observed seed ageing, the fact that we investigated seeds in a dry state at low seed moisture content and that they were not exposed to the outside space environment did allow a critical discussion of the expected importance of each of these space factors.</p>

(2007) demonstrated that rocket seed germination and seedling growth on board the ISS was affected in that the maximum germination percentage was reduced from 95% to 80% and that subsequent seedling growth and nutrient content were negatively affected. In contrast to their experiment, which included germinating rocket seeds in microgravity on board the ISS, in our Rocket Science project dry rocket seeds were subjected to the spaceflight and no germination experiments on board the ISS were conducted. Known mechanisms for gravity sensing and signaling are evident just after the completion of seed germination and in growing seedlings [<xref rid="B2-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The dry seed state is not gravity-sensitive, as water- and hormone-controlled processes are needed for gravity responses. In agreement with this, we did not observe a reduction of the maximum germination percentage of our Space seed batch and also did not observe abnormal seedlings, confirming the retained seed viability. We demonstrate that when rocket germinated in earthbound conditions, the Space seeds developed into normal and nutritious seedlings rich in carotenoids, chlorophyll, and antioxidants (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S3</xref>). The microgravity experienced by the dry rocket seeds therefore does not seem to be a major factor for the observed seed ageing and seed vigor reduction.</p>
                <p>The space factors of gas, pressure, and humidity are also unlikely to play a major role in our Rocket Science experiment because the seeds were stored in a low-hydrated state in hermetically sealed packs (at 25% RH) inside the ISS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). During the entire spaceflight, the seeds were transported at 18–25 °C (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S1</xref>), but because no temperature datalogger was used we cannot rule out occasional fluctuations beyond this temperature range. What is however clear is that the seeds did not experience temperatures high enough to reduce their viability. They were retained in a dry state at low humidity and low oxygen conditions at ~22 °C ambient temperature on the ISS (and 18–25 °C during the other parts of the space journey), which provides good storage conditions for maintaining viability of this species for several years [<xref rid="B18-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B37-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The warehouse storage (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S1</xref>) of our Earth (~22 °C) and Earth-WS (14 °C) seeds was also in hermetically sealed packs at low humidity and low oxygen, and neither of the two temperatures caused seed ageing during dry storage. Even if the seeds would have experienced temporarily hotter temperatures (e.g., ~30 °C), this is not expected to severely affect rocket seed quality as <italic>Eruca</italic> species are adapted to the Mediterranean region [<xref rid="B76-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], have their germination optimum at ~30 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f001">Figure 1</xref>D), and remain viable even when stored in the dry state at 45 °C for several months [<xref rid="B37-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Mechanical vibration can damage [<xref rid="B77-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] or improve [<xref rid="B78-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] seed germination. These works demonstrated that vibration in the imbibed state increased both the speed and maximum percentage of Arabidopsis germination and that, in the air-dry state, the mechanical damage which reduced the germinability depended on the seed moisture content. The observed increased equilibrium seed moisture content of the rocket seeds from the Space batch as compared to the Earth and Earth-WS batches (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-life-10-00049">Figure S2</xref>) may be due to spaceflight-induced alterations of the biomechanical seed properties. Mechanical vibration, acceleration, and very high sound levels from the take-off, landing, and spaceflight may indeed act synergistically together with space radiation to cause the observed ageing of the Space seeds.</p>
                <p>Shielding provided by the ISS during the six months of rocket seed storage in LEO excluded the exposure to short-wavelength UV radiation known for its negative effects on seed lot viability [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B30-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Excluding space UV leaves exposure to ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays, trapped protons, and solar energetic particles which together provide an absorbed dose of ~500 µGy/day in LEO [<xref rid="B30-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B74-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B79-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Shielding reduces this to 250–300 µGy/day inside the ISS, which is much higher than the Earth surface (ground control) at 1–3 µGy/day. Precise simulation of the complex space non-UV radiation is not possible, but dose–response experiments with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation (e.g., X- and γ-rays) demonstrated for the irradiation of dry tomato seeds that absorbed doses of up to ~300 Gy did not appreciably affect the maximal germination percentage [<xref rid="B81-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, the height of tomato plants grown from irradiated seeds was reduced for absorbed doses above ~50 Gy, while low absorbed doses of ~10 Gy increased plant growth. For maize seeds above ~100 Gy caused a reduction in the maximal germination percentage and also reduced plant growth [<xref rid="B83-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. No reduction in the maximum germination percentage was observed when dry Arabidopsis seeds were γ-irradiated with 100–1000 Gy, but DNA damage and seedling defects were observed at 100 Gy and increased in a dose-dependent manner [<xref rid="B60-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Mixed results were obtained for seed storage in the long-duration-exposure facilities of satellites in LEO, resulting in reduced, equal, or improved germination and survival compared to seeds stored on Earth [<xref rid="B1-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The shielded storage of tomato seeds for 69 months was in sealed canisters (0.1 MPa, 20% RH, temperatures fluctuating between −25 and 35 °C) causing ionizing space radiation exposure of ~7.2 Gy [<xref rid="B84-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Compared to the Earth-based control (0.1 MPa (normal pressure), 20% RH, 21 °C), the space-flown seeds germinated slightly quicker and had higher seedling emergence and growth, indicating that tomato seeds were resilient to such spaceflight. Similar space radiation exposure of maize seeds did not appreciably affect their maximal germination percentages but increased their sensitivity to other forms of radiation and caused a somatic mutagenesis equivalent to ~6.4 Gy [<xref rid="B85-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Tomato seeds stored in on board the space station MIR for six years (~1 Gy) exhibited reduced seedling growth and a &gt;10-fold increase in DNA mutation rate [<xref rid="B86-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Exposure of rice seed lots to LEO in containers attached outside the ISS for 13 and 20 months reduced their maximum germination percentage and affected their dry seed transcriptome. It was proposed from this work that damage to long-lived mRNAs stored in dry seeds causes the change in germination properties [<xref rid="B33-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For our Rocket Science project, six months of storage on the ISS would equate to ~50 mGy [<xref rid="B74-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B80-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] for the Space seeds which is a low absorbed dose compared to the described examples, but compared to the Earth seeds it is &gt;&gt;100-times more absorbed radiation. Taken together we therefore propose that, perhaps synergistically with mechanical vibration, the exposure of the dry rocket seeds to this low-level ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays, trapped protons, and solar energetic particles was the major factor that caused the observed seed ageing and transcriptome changes. Future experiments need to be designed in a way that allows explicit discrimination between the individual spaceflight environmental factors.</p>

                <title>4.2. Effects of Spaceflight Associated Ageing on the Seed Transcriptome</title>
                <p>To determine if ageing and space travel shared any parallels in terms of their effects of germination physiology and the transcriptome, RNAseq analysis of dry and controlled artificial ageing treatment (CAAT) rocket seed samples were performed. Both the physiological assays and transcriptome analysis pointed towards a potential partial ageing effect of the spaceflight. Compared to the CAAT, the effects of spaceflight were relatively subtle. For example, the delay in germination caused by spaceflight was less than the effect of eight days of CAAT but greater than the effect of four days of CAAT. Most intriguing for the global changes was that the space-flown dry seed transcriptomes were positioned between the dry seed ground controls and the CAAT samples in the PCA analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Overlaps in DEGs between CAAT and spaceflight were observed, as was similarity in functional categories of the genes. However, the effect of CAAT was more pronounced, leading to a large number of CAAT-specific DEGs; in addition some spaceflight-specific DEGs were observed. It may be speculated that the degradation of stored mRNAs involved in seed germination in space-flown seeds, as in ageing, may contribute to the delay in germination. A similar hypothesis is proposed for the effect of exposure to space outside the ISS in delaying and reducing rice germination, where degradation of long-lived seed mRNAs was observed [<xref rid="B33-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To our knowledge no other dry seed storage work has been published presenting the effects of spaceflight on the dry seed transcriptomes. Although the physiological and mutation effects of dry seed irradiation (X- and γ-ray simulation experiments) were studied in a considerable number of publications [<xref rid="B60-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B81-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], none of them provides a global analysis of the effects on the seed transcriptomes.</p>
                <p>Transcriptome analyses of dry-stored seeds have been conducted over various storage periods and ambient conditions (humidity, temperature, oxygen) to investigate their relation to after-ripening and dormancy release as well as longevity, ageing, and viability loss. Long-term seed storage experiments (1–30 years, 35–50% RH, 5 °C) revealed that in many cases RNA integrity (RIN value) of dry seeds decreased over storage time before viability loss [<xref rid="B24-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Compared to this work, the six months of seed storage in our Rocket Science project is short, and we also did not observe appreciably reduced RIN values in our Space RNA samples. Various mechanisms for transcript abundance changes during dry after-ripening storage, which releases dormancy and enhances germination, have been proposed [<xref rid="B57-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B87-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B88-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In oilseeds, pockets of higher moisture content in non-oil regions could allow transcription even in low-hydrated seeds [<xref rid="B57-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B87-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. <italic>Eruca sativa</italic> seeds contain &gt;40% oil, and the 8.0% overall moisture content of the Space seeds could therefore provide such pockets of higher moisture content distinct from Earth seeds (6.3%) during the various stages of the spaceflight and seed packaging process. Selective degradation of transcripts has also been shown to contribute to transcriptome differences in dry seeds owing to the distinct relative stability of transcripts [<xref rid="B24-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B88-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B89-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In dry seeds, after-ripening and ageing may both be associated with accumulation of damage caused by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative damage to nucleic acids (including mRNAs), proteins, and lipids [<xref rid="B20-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B71-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B73-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Bazin et al. (2011) proposed that dormancy release during sunflower seed after-ripening is caused by selective mRNA oxidation. They identified 24 stored mRNAs that became highly oxidized, mainly corresponding to genes involved in stress responses and signaling. Low-energy heavy-ion radiation of dry Arabidopsis seeds induced excess ROS in seeds, delaying germination and negatively affecting seedling growth and the activities of antioxidant enzymes [<xref rid="B90-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Irradiation of dry rice seeds with ionizing radiation affected the expression of genes related to ROS scavenging and signal transduction in the derived seedlings [<xref rid="B91-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. We found in our rocket seed transcriptomes that ROS-related transcripts including catalases are upregulated in Earth samples upon CAAT as well as in the dry seed Space samples without CAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together it is therefore possible that oxidative stress caused by the low-level absorbed space radiation during the spaceflight caused the ageing-related transcriptome changes.</p>
                <p>Similar to our CAAT, which achieved rocket seed ageing within 8–15 days (70% RH, 35 °C), others used elevated RH and temperature to study the transcriptome and proteome changes during their short-duration artificial seed ageing treatments [<xref rid="B72-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,<xref rid="B92-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,<xref rid="B93-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Evidence for de novo transcription and oxidative stress responses was revealed by these studies. A number of parallels between the effects of seed ageing in our study with rocket seeds and a previous study on pea seed ageing can be drawn [<xref rid="B72-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. For example, one of the strongest signals in both studies is the enrichment of translational machinery (particularly 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits) in genes downregulated by ageing. A similar trend is also observed in the proteome and is suggested to delay protein synthesis, and therefore germination, to allow for nucleic acid damage repair to take place [<xref rid="B93-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Indeed, consistent with this and a decreased level of 60S and 40S ribosomal subunit related genes in dry Space seeds and in CAAT Earth seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>), we observe a delay in germination and the relative increase in a number of transcripts associated with DNA repair, perhaps indicating that translation of these stored mRNAs is necessary soon after imbibition. We identified a number of transcripts encoding heat shock protein (HSP) and DNAJ-related molecular chaperones, as well as a heat shock factor (HSF), that were more abundant in dry Space seeds and upon CAAT in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f005">Figure 5</xref>). DNAJ6-like and JJJ1 are DNAJ protein chaperones that interact with Hsp70, with the latter being involved in proper assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit [<xref rid="B61-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The protective role of the HSP90 chaperone in γ-irradiated Arabidopsis seeds was demonstrated [<xref rid="B60-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. An increase in the transcript abundances of nine HSPs was evident in the transcriptomes of dry rice seeds exposed to the space environment [<xref rid="B33-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and an essential role of HSFs in the adaption of cell cultures to spaceflight was identified [<xref rid="B11-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An increase in abundance of transcripts encoding molecular chaperones (including HSPs) was also observed in artificially aged pea seeds [<xref rid="B72-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and a seed-ageing-related HSF was identified in rapeseed [<xref rid="B92-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Seed ageing, including in space and in artificial assays, therefore shares transcriptome responses associated with oxidative stress. Our observation in rocket seeds that some transcript abundances were increased, and others were decreased, in response to spaceflight and ageing treatments could therefore be a combination of de novo transcription and selective oxidative degradation. In any case, the changes in relative transcript abundances affect the behavior of the seeds upon imbibition.</p>
                <p>Like other organisms, plants employ a range of DNA repair pathways to ensure faithful replication, proper organization, and transcription, and the mode of repair depends on developmental stage and DNA damage type (reviewed in [<xref rid="B63-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B66-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]). Repair of DNA damage acquired during dehydration, quiescence, and rehydration is critical in determining successful germination and seedling establishment following rehydration of dry quiescent seeds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows that the sum of transcript abundances annotated with the GO term ‘response to radiation’ was increased in dry rocket Space seeds, and specific examples are highlighted in this figure and the corresponding main text in the results part. Consistent with a role in the Space seed ageing, the ‘response to radiation’ transcript abundances also increase in Earth seed samples upon CAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). An example for this is the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM, a key factor in the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, known to control ageing-induced DNA repair during seed imbibition [<xref rid="B62-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In rocket seeds, <italic>ATM</italic> transcript abundance is higher in Space samples and increases in Earth samples upon CAAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). For the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway [<xref rid="B65-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], a similar pattern is observed for NER components such as <italic>XPB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>DNA ligase 1 (LIG1)</italic>, involved in DSB and single-strand break repair [<xref rid="B25-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B67-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] was also enriched by CAAT, although <italic>LIG IV</italic> and <italic>LIG VI</italic>, which are associated with DSB repair in seed longevity and elevation in expression following seed imbibition, were not affected at the transcript level. Some components of the photoactivation repair (PR) pathway are also upregulated in rocket seeds upon CAAT, but except for <italic>HY5</italic> no elevated transcript abundances were evident in dry Space seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The UV-B photoreceptor (UVR8) signaling can induce expression of photolyases involved in DNA repair, in part via a HY5-dependent pathway; in the absence of UV-B, COP1 can antagonize this response [<xref rid="B68-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="B69-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Taken together, the Space rocket seeds were shielded against UV irradiation on board the ISS but experienced low-level ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays, trapped protons, and solar energetic particles which may have caused the upregulation of DSB (<italic>ATM</italic>) and NER (<italic>XBP</italic>) DNA pathway transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="life-10-00049-f006">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that DNA is a target of the partial seed ageing.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions and Future Directions</title>
              <p>Maintaining crop seed quality (vigor and viability) during long-term warehouse storage is a major challenge for the global seed industry and is achieved by reducing humidity, temperature, and oxygen to slow down the rate of seed ageing in the dry state. The resilience of dry seeds was revealed in exposure experiments to the harsh space environment in which their viability was maintained for a considerable time if shielded against the short-wave UV irradiation. Our Rocket Science project results suggest that for maintaining the vigor component of the crop seed quality during long-term spaceflights, additional protection is required. We hypothesize that the observed rocket seed ageing during the space travel, which included six months of dry storage on board the ISS, is caused mainly by exposure to low-level ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays, trapped protons, and solar energetic particles, perhaps in combination with mechanical vibration. The absorbed radiation dose on board the ISS would equate to ~50 mGy, &gt;&gt;100-times more than on the Earth surface [<xref rid="B74-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="B75-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="B80-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and affected the seed transcriptome, germination physiology, and ageing sensitivity. However, long-distance spaceflights would cause much higher exposures for seeds as well as for humans. Calculated exposure on a mission to Mars for example would likely be at least 5-times greater than that experienced by the rocket seed on the ISS. Our study was also limited in that only one seed batch of one species was sent to space and that we did not use a temperature datalogger. Seed storability and ageing resilience, however, differ considerably between seed lots, cultivars, and species, depending on the crop genotype and seed production environment [<xref rid="B19-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, careful consideration of seed material, reducing mechanical vibration, and shielding from space radiation would be prudent when taking dry seeds beyond Earth’s orbit, although this study and many others suggest that the goal of growing crops on other worlds is achievable [<xref rid="B2-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B6-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-life-10-00049" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </p>

                <p>Comparison of gene ontology (GO) term enrichment in space- and CAAT-induced DEGs from rocket seed transcriptomes. GO terms with minimum enrichment scores above 4.8 in at least one DEG list were hierarchically clustered by their enrichment scores in the four DEG lists: Up in Space, Down in Space (Earth dry vs. Space dry), Up in CAAT, and Down in CAAT genes (Earth dry vs. Earth CAAT). Seven clusters (I to VII) are shown and annotated with the direction of expression levels for space and CAAT treatment associated with the GO terms (up or down arrows).</p>
