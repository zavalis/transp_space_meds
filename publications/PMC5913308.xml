                <p id="Par1">Gravity is the only component of Earth environment that remained constant throughout the entire process of biological evolution. However, it is still unclear how gravity affects plant growth and development. In this study, an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> was exposed to different altered gravity conditions, namely simulated reduced gravity (simulated microgravity, simulated Mars gravity) and hypergravity (2g), to study changes in cell proliferation, cell growth, and epigenetics. The effects after 3, 14, and 24-hours of exposure were evaluated. The most relevant alterations were found in the 24-hour treatment, being more significant for simulated reduced gravity than hypergravity. Cell proliferation and growth were uncoupled under simulated reduced gravity, similarly, as found in meristematic cells from seedlings grown in real or simulated microgravity. The distribution of cell cycle phases was changed, as well as the levels and gene transcription of the tested cell cycle regulators. Ribosome biogenesis was decreased, according to levels and gene transcription of nucleolar proteins and the number of inactive nucleoli. Furthermore, we found alterations in the epigenetic modifications of chromatin. These results show that altered gravity effects include a serious disturbance of cell proliferation and growth, which are cellular functions essential for normal plant development.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Plants on Earth are subjected to a constant mechanical stimulation from the gravitational field, which has played a major role in their evolution. Gravity is the only parameter which has remained constant on Earth since life appeared on the surface of our planet, regarding both the direction and magnitude of the gravity vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. All living organisms are well adapted to this 1 <italic>g</italic> level, which is used by plants to define their developmental pattern and to optimize the capture of light, water, and mineral salts. Thus, any changes of this parameters would cause significant physiological alterations, which would activate the adaptive response pathways. Understanding these changes is important for increasing our basic knowledge on plant physiology, and it is also essential for plant space biology if we consider that the magnitude of gravity is one of the most important factors differentiating the Earth environment from other celestial bodies. The same qualities that make plants essential to life on Earth, namely absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>, release of O<sub>2</sub> and water vapor, and their use as a food source make them highly desirable on long-term human space missions, as essential components of “Bioregenerative Life Support Systems”. For this purpose, plants need to be adapted to grow in near-zero gravity (space) and fractional gravity, e.g., on the Moon, where the gravitational acceleration is 1/6 <italic>g</italic>, or on Mars at 3/8 <italic>g</italic>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Spaceflights to the International Space Station (ISS) provide unique conditions to investigate plant biology in microgravity. However, research in the Near-Earth Orbit and access to ISS is severely constrained by the limited number of flight opportunities. For that reason, ground-based facilities (GBFs) for simulated microgravity are valuable tools for preparing spaceflight experiments and also for facilitating stand-alone studies. They provide an additional cost-efficient platform for gravitational research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Several ground-based facilities have been developed, capable of providing a simulation of altered gravity environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. For instance, a simulated reduced gravity environment can be simulated by 3D rotation of the biological object in a Random Positioning Machine (RPM, Airbus Defense and Space, Leiden, The Netherlands)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and a Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC) can indeed provide a stable hypergravity environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Different types of plant biological systems, mostly from the model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, have been used in microgravity investigations including plant seedlings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and semisolid cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Plant <italic>in vitro</italic> suspension cell culture is a powerful tool as a model in plant cell cycle studies of actively proliferating cells, a subpopulation that it is represented by some dozens of cells in the meristems of the plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, the choice of cell cultures allows the use of experimental and analytical approaches that require thousands of cells. Dispersed plant cell suspension cultures also allow the study of cell division in the absence of any further developmental process, by providing a homogenous population of near-identical cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Among the few available <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell cultures, a suspension culture of the fast-growing cell line MM2d was selected and maintained<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> to be used in our study.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Since gravity is a driving force for plant development, the study of cell growth and proliferation mechanisms under real and simulated microgravity has general relevance, other than the specific interest of these research topics in solving current problems of space exploration and space biology. Indeed, the activation of modulators of cell growth and cell proliferation in meristems plays a key role in the regulation of plant development. Cell growth and cell proliferation are tightly interconnected to one another in actively proliferating cells, and the coordinated response of meristematic cell functions to developmental signals was called “meristematic competence”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">In general, cell division is modulated through the regulation of cell cycle progression, which occurs at known checkpoints, and determines the rate at which cells divide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The cell cycle is one of the most comprehensively studied biological processes, particularly given its importance for growth and development; indeed, the role of the cell cycle machinery during development remains an important scientific challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A typical proliferating eukaryotic cell divides on average every 24 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In turn, cell growth, in meristematic cells, expressly represents the production of cell biomass, mainly proteins, above a certain threshold compatible with cell division, which is subjected to a particular checkpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In actively proliferating (cycling) cells, which, in plants, are meristematic cells, the concept of “cell growth” is different from “cell expansion”, and the difference is not semantic, but physiological. It has been demonstrated that not all processes involving an increase of the size of the cell should strictly be called “cell growth”, but this term should be reserved to those processes involving macromolecular (protein) synthesis. This process requires ribosome biogenesis and hence RNA pol I activity. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in a variety of proliferating cell systems, both plant and animal, and, specifically, in plant meristematic cells. A great deal of work has been devoted to provide experimental support to these arguments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Consequently, meristematic cell growth is determined largely by the activity of ribosome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This occurs in a distinct nuclear domain, the nucleolus, whose structural features are a reliable marker of the rate of ribosome production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par7">On the ISS, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root meristematic cells exposed to the microgravity environment resulted in the uncoupling of cell growth and cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Subsequent experiments performed on Earth with seedlings, using different facilities for simulation of altered gravity conditions, have shown similar trends as in spaceflight. Simulated microgravity affects the regulation of cell cycle progression, as shown by changes in the transcription of cyclin B1. The same experiments indicated a depletion of the nucleolar activity and ribosome biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Alternatively, exposing <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings to hypergravity (2g), had less impact on plants than microgravity, as shown by the effects on cell growth and proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In other experiments on meristematic root cells grown in simulated microgravity, a depletion of ribosome biogenesis was reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, but these findings were not connected to other cell functions. However, alterations in cell cycle regulation induced by real microgravity have been observed in other biological model systems, including human cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Furthermore, genomic and proteomic experiments with callus cell cultures of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> in real and simulated microgravity, including microarray experiments, have also demonstrated alterations in the expression of genes and proteins involved in various processes, functions and cellular activities, some of them related to abiotic stress responses and cell cycle regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par9">In addition to the effects induced by the microgravity environment, it would be interesting to explore the cellular response of proliferating cells to partial gravity (less than the nominal 1 <italic>g</italic> that occurs on Earth). This interest is related to space biology, and space exploration since these levels of partial gravity are found at the Moon (0.17 <italic>g</italic>) and Mars (0.37 <italic>g</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Such studies also have a general physiological relevance since this investigation would allow the determination of thresholds for the biological response to gravitational alterations. In terms of our current levels of knowledge, the regulation of the cell cycle under partial gravity is understudied despite its future relevance.</p>
              <p id="Par10">Understanding the effects of an environmental change in reprogramming cellular functions and gene expression patterns should consider, necessarily, epigenetic mechanisms. Term of Epigenetics is used for the study of heritable changes in gene expression and activity that occur without any alteration of DNA sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Much of today’s epigenetic research is converging on the study of covalent and noncovalent changes in DNA and histone proteins and the mechanisms by which such changes influence overall chromatin structure. Two major changes, responsible for epigenetic mechanisms, have been identified: methylation of the cytosine residues of DNA (DNA methylation) and different types of modification of histone proteins associated with DNA (histone modifications), the most important of which is acetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Functionally, epigenetic mechanisms influence gene activity and expression through changes in the structural state of chromatin, which may have either positive or negative impact on gene transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Chromatin structure is recognized as a highly dynamic and major player in cell cycle regulation, not only owing to the changes that occur as a consequence of cell cycle progression but also because some specific chromatin modifications are crucial to move across the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent studies reported that core cell cycle regulators control gene expression through histone modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par11">Therefore, the purpose of this work is, firstly, to further validate <italic>in vitro</italic> plant cell culture as a model system to study alterations induced by gravity changes. Secondly, we aim to get a better understanding of the mechanisms operating at the level of individual cells in their response to the gravitational stress affecting cell growth and cell proliferation. We also consider the mechanisms altering the regulation of the cell cycle and the response to gravitational alterations through chromatin remodeling. Furthermore, we aim to extend our investigations to a wide range of gravitational levels, including two levels of simulated reduced gravity (simulated microgravity (µ<italic>g</italic>) and simulated partial gravity) and hypergravity (2g). In the case of partial gravity, simulated Mars gravity (0.37 <italic>g</italic>) will be used, with the purpose of achieving both basic knowledge about partial gravity effects as well as contributing to make possible a manned Mars exploration program.</p>

                <title>Gravitational alterations induced changes in the distribution of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell cycle phases</title>
                <p id="Par12">We have investigated the changes in different parameters of the cell cycle caused by the exposure of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cultured cells at various simulated gravity levels. Considering that the duration of the eukaryotic cell cycle is approximately 24 hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, our experiments consisted of a series of treatments of different duration involving the exposure to altered gravity conditions for 3, 14, and 24 hours. We found that the proportion of cells in the different cell cycle phases was changed by exposures of the various durations at different (simulated) gravity levels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). After 3 hours, the distribution of the cell cycle phases among different gravity levels showed no significant alterations. Only in the sample simulating Mars gravity a small increment on the proportion of cells in S-phase was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). However, after 14 hours, the number of cells in S-phase increased significantly in all conditions of altered gravity, accompanied by a reduction of the proportion of cells in G1, especially under simulated microgravity and hypergravity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The 24-hour experiment showed more-defined influence of the change in the gravity levels on the cell cycle phase distribution. Both simulated reduced gravity samples showed the same trend, producing a significant increment on the G2/M and the S-phase rates at the expense of the G1 rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>).

In particular, we have estimated changes induced by our simulations on the transcription levels of AtNUC1 (nucleolin 1) gene, taken as marker of ribosome biogenesis, the Prolifera gene, taken as marker of cell proliferation, and MET1 (DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1) gene, taken as marker of epigenetic mechanisms. Nucleolin transcription, as a cell-growth-related marker, showed a general decrease in the two levels of simulated reduced gravity, and in the three experiments using different times of exposure. The highest reduction in the transcription level was recorded after 24 hours of exposure to the simulated Mars gravity. On the contrary, hypergravity induced higher nucleolin transcription levels, particularly significant after 14 hours of exposure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>).

The results obtained in GBFs in our model system provide evidence of a cellular response to an altered perception of the magnitude of the gravity vector. This response can be put in relation to the response of meristematic cells exposed to real or simulated microgravity and provides new parameters and new insights for the discrimination of the specific mechanisms of response at the cellular level. Moreover, we have analyzed epigenetic mechanisms involved in these changes induced by altered gravity, which have a significant influence on the processes of plant growth and development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par27">Our experiments included exposures of different durations in order to identify the minimum duration of the environmental disturbances capable of affecting the functions studied in the cell culture. Taking into account the length of the eukaryotic cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, it is clear that the treatment of 24 hours corresponds to an entire cell cycle, 14 hours to, approximately, a half, and 3 hours to a fraction of less than 15%. The existence of these effects, even at the shortest of these treatments, indicates a high sensitivity of the regulatory mechanisms to the altered gravity simulated conditions. The inclusion of a single cell cycle checkpoint within the treatment is enough to produce detectable effects. However, the correlation of the intensity of effects with the duration of the treatment indicates that not all the cell cycle phases are equally sensitive to the altered gravity treatment. Most probably, the effects of the treatment only (or mostly) occur when it includes one or more of the known checkpoints (G1/S, G2/M, and anaphase).</p>
              <p id="Par28">The progression of the cell cycle is disrupted in response to the effective gravitational load. Cell cycle phase distributions changed after 14 and 24 hour exposures to simulated altered gravity. Results obtained from the flow cytometry study on cells exposed to simulated reduced gravity (micro- and Mars gravity levels) revealed that cells are accumulated in S-phase, gradually passing to the G2 period, and then to mitosis, through the exposure time. Furthermore, a reduction on the proportion of cells in G1 is observed, whose meaning is that cells are entering faster into the S-phase. EdU labeling confirmed accumulation of cells in S-phase. Also, the proportion of cells in G2 also showed an increment under simulated reduced gravity conditions. In contrast, the cell cycle shows a slower progression under hypergravity, resulting in a lower rate of cell proliferation. The acceleration of the cell cycle is the consequence of changes in cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin B1, detectable at the levels of both gene transcription and cellular protein amount. The enhancement of the cell proliferation rate and the change in the cyclin B1 gene transcription levels were reported in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root meristematic cells of seedlings grown under real or simulated microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and in semi-solid cell cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Otherwise, the acceleration of the cell cycle is well-matched with a higher level of the Prolifera antigen (both at the protein and transcriptional level) under simulated reduced gravity levels. Prolifera is a minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein complex which enters into the nucleus, binds chromatin and participates in the initiation of replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> suggesting that it plays a key regulatory role in G1/S transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p>

In our experiments the rate of ribosome biogenesis has been quantitatively assessed by using the nucleolar proteins nucleolin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and fibrillarin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> as markers of ribosome biogenesis, whose levels are known to correlate to the rate of production of ribosomes. Both transcript and protein expressions of these markers were measured. Nucleolin and fibrillarin protein levels decreased with the exposure to simulated reduced gravity, while the alterations caused by hypergravity were not evident. Moreover, the alteration on nucleolin protein expression is stronger than in the case of fibrillarin, which has a more accurate role in the early steps of pre-rRNA processing. The nucleolin protein decrease is supported by the significant down-regulation of the <italic>AtNUC1</italic> gene transcription. Additionally, the alteration in gene transcription was quick, even in the 3-hour experiment, compared with the reduction in the protein levels, which reached significance only after 14 hours under simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Data obtained on regulation of ribosome biogenesis are in complete agreement with the results on the morpho-functional features of the nucleolus, a highly polymorphic structure, which changes its structure in response to functional alterations, as it has been reported by numerous investigators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. It is well established that the rate of ribosome biogenesis can be estimated throughout the molecular cytology of the nucleolus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. The nucleolar morpho-functional types, which were identified and characterized using the electron microscope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> could be easily identified using phase-contrast microscopy in samples exposed to differential gravitational effects. Under both simulated reducedd gravity and hypergravity, there was a steady significant decrease in the number vacuolated and compact nucleoli cells (those types characterized by a higher activity), at the expenses of an increase in the inactive fibrillar nucleoli, which was maximized after the 24 hour experiment with the complete loss of vacuolated nucleoli models. These results are entirely consistent with previous results of our laboratory using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> semisolid cell cultures under simulated microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and root meristems under real and simulated microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Epigenetic mechanisms in the chromatin can be considered as a plant systemic response to gravitational alterations. The regulation of genes via cytosine methylation and histone modification is a well-recognized component of the plant responses to environmental stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. In our <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell cultures, an increase in the overall cytosine methylation pattern was detected under simulated reduced gravity conditions. The results of DNA methylation, based on immunofluorescence protein assays (flow cytometry and confocal microscopy) showed a quick and extensive hypermethylation of cytosine residues through different times of exposure to simulated reduced gravity conditions, including simulated microgravity and simulated Mars gravity. This observation is consistent with the up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase (MET1) gene transcription quantitatively detected by qPCR. This enzyme is mainly involved in maintaining symmetric cytosine methylation, suggesting that DNA methylation could participate in the regulation of gene transcription in response to the gravitational stress. Similarly, we analyzed histone acetylation. The presence of the acetylated histone H4 appeared increasingly depleted by the simulated reduced gravity treatments through the exposure time, thus indicating that reduced gravity load causes histone deacetylation. Some rice and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> studies shown that histone deacetylation is involved in ABA and stress response pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par32">In conclusion, our results suggest that different altered gravity environments produce a serious stress on proliferating plant cells, capable of uncoupling cell proliferation and cellular growth. The use of simulation facilities in partial gravity studies is promising, but it should be further tested and validated <italic>versus</italic> real flight data in the future in order to confirm or reject the user potential of RPM for microgravity and partial g simulator. To determine effective countermeasures for the gravitational stress and the mechanisms and strategies for the plant adaptation and survival in the altered gravity environment is one of the greatest challenges of space plant biology with significant general consequences for plant physiology and cell biology.</p>

                <p id="Par34">Agarose-embedded <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell suspension cultures were used to study the impact of altered gravity levels. To reproduce the effects of altered gravity, two devices were used (Supplementary Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>); the random positioning machine (RPM: simulated microgravity and simulated partial gravity (Mars gravity) and the Large Diameter Centrifuge (LDC: hypergravity). The 1 <italic>g</italic> control experiment was performed with the samples attached to the RPM frames, in order for the control cells to be subjected to the same temperature and as closely as possible to any residual vibrations for samples grown in the rotating RPM. To reduce the extracellular fluid motion effect to a minimum, the cells are immobilized in agarose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The RPM in its original configuration is a widely used simulator for microgravity, particularly validated in the use with plant systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. To produce simulated microgravity, a real random algorithm was used with the maximum angular speed set at 60° per second with random direction and interval. To produce simulated fractional gravity of Mars (0.37 g), a novel algorithm driving the RPM motion, extensively described and validated elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> was used. In short simulated microgravity is provided by a standard RPM, the randomness of the algorithm is such that over time an imaginary sphere would be perfectly covered with the random paths of the two frames of the RPM would describe, time averaging the g vector orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The novel algorithm we used in this study for Mars partial g simulation is such that the shape of the imaginary sphere is deformed to a prolate spheroid, the shape of which defined the skewed orientation of the gravity vector such that there is, over time, an averaged preferred orientation towards to Earth gravity field resulting in a partial randomization of the g vector, so a certain level of partial gravity remains present (in our case 0.37 g). Hypergravity (2g) environment was obtained using the LDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. We decided to use 2g as a moderate increased gravitational stimulus, potentially enough to activate the specific response to increased load, and moderate enough not to compromise cell integrity and saturate global stress pathways. The study was performed at the European Space Technology Center (ESTEC) of the European Space Agency (ESA) in Noordwijk, The Netherlands. Experiments were performed for different times of exposure to altered gravity: 3, 14, and 24 hour), each in three replicates, at 27 °C, in the dark.</p>
