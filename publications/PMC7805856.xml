              <abstract>
                <p>This paper introduces Augmented Reality (AR) system to support an astronaut's manual work, it has been developed in two phases. The first phase was developed in Europeans Space Agency's (ESA) project called “EdcAR—Augmented Reality for Assembly, Integration, Testing and Verification, and Operations” and the second phase was developed and evaluated within the Horizon 2020 project “WEKIT—Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training.” The main aim is to create an AR based technological platform for high knowledge manual work support, in the aerospace industry with reasonable user experience. The AR system was designed for the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform, and it was implemented based on a modular architecture. The purpose of the evaluation of the AR system is to prove that reasonable user experience of augmented reality can reduce performance errors while executing a procedure, increase memorability, and improve cost, and time efficiency of the training. The main purpose of the first phase evaluation was to observe and get feedback from the AR system, from user experience point-of-view for the future development. The use case was a filter change in International Space Station (ISS)—Columbus mock-up in the ESA's European Astronaut Centre (EAC). The test group of 14 subjects it included an experienced astronaut, EAC trainers, other EAC personnel, and a student group. The second phase the experiment consisted of an <italic>in-situ</italic> trial and evaluation process. The augmented reality system was tested at ALTEC facilities in Turin, Italy, where 39 participants were performing an actual real astronaut's procedure, the installation of Temporary Stowage Rack (TSR) on a physical mock-up of an ISS module. User experience evaluation was assessed using comprehensive questionnaires, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their experience with a platform. This focused on technology acceptance, system usability, smart glasses user satisfaction, user interaction satisfaction, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their experience with a platform. The analysis of the questionnaires and interviews showed that the scores obtained for user experience, usability, user satisfaction, and technology acceptance were near the desired average. Specifically, The System Usability Scale (SUS) score was 68 indicating that the system usability is already nearly acceptable in the augmented reality platform.</p>

              <p>This paper introduces AR system to support an astronaut's manual work. The work presented in this paper falls under two individual projects, which have a direct continuum. The first phase was developed in Europeans Space Agency's project called “EdcAR—Augmented Reality for Assembly, Integration, Testing and Verification, and Operations” (Helin, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and the second phase was developed and evaluated within the Horizon 2020 project “WEKIT—Wearable Experience for Knowledge Intensive Training” (Vizzi et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The AR system was designed for the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform (Microsoft, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and it was implemented based on a modular architecture. Moreover, the content creation and visualization were designed by the main principles of the IEEE Draft Standard for an Augmented Reality Learning Experience Mode (IEEE: ARLEM, 2018)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. The AR system was pre-evaluated in the ISS-Columbus training center located in the ESA's European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany (Tedone et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The test team included an experienced astronaut. Updated versions of the final tests were performed on the ISS the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) modules mock-up at ALTEC premises (Vizzi et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The current generation of AR can provide immersive experience where human vision and other senses are manipulated in a way that are very believable and seem to alter reality. Wearable Technologies (WT), such as smart glasses, play an important role as delivery devices for such immersive experience (Wild et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The objective of this study is to verify if Augmented Reality can be an eligible technology and productive tools in the aerospace industry.</p>
              <p>One promising application for AR guidance and training is in maintenance and assembly; also termed AR instructions (Re and Bordegoni, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), AR-based job aid (Anastassova et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), AR-assisted maintenance system and AR-based assembly guidance (Ong et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). AR guidance means that instructions are given to the user in textual, and/or visual format, augmented on the target objects. The benefits of AR guidance in assembly and maintenance have been noted in several studies: the tasks were easier to handle and they could be done more effectively and with fewer mistakes compared to other instruction formats, and skill transfer could be enhanced (Ong et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p>
              <p>User studies in AR contexts have regarded human perception, user task performance, and collaboration between multiple collaborating users, and interface or system usability (Dünser et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Users' subjective experiences were most often measured using preference, ease of use, perceived performance, and intuitiveness. The methods in AR user studies have included questionnaires, and/or performance measures (Bai and Blackwell, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), although some qualitative measures derived using direct observations, video analysis, and interviews have also been mentioned (Dünser and Billinghurst, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Many user studies have highlighted the potential of AR guidance in work support, however also suggested a number improvements in user experience and design process (e.g., Kuula et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Woodward et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Helin et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Aaltonen et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These indicate that user-centric development should be done both in technology and content creation in order to create convincing AR solutions for the end users.</p>
              <p>Offering a stimulating and pleasurable user experience (UX) is becoming a central goal and design strategy in the design of digital artifacts and services. The main challenges related to UX can be divided to (1) designing a user experience that is pleasurable, engaging and stimulating, and appropriate in the user's context, and (2) evaluating the UX and overall acceptability of the applications (Olsson, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The ISO standard (ISO 9241–210:2010)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref> defines UX as “A person's perceptions and responses resulting from the use and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service.” In this study, UX is evaluated using a set of methods including observation, questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, also aspects of usability are included in the methods. Usability theories focus on pragmatic aspects of product use that furthermore are relatively persistent and at least partly objectively definable for example task completion efficiency, effectiveness and ease-of-use. As for UX, it moves toward a more emotionally appealing relationship between the user and the product (Olsson, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Since the boundary between UX and usability in not always very unambiguous, both pragmatic and emotional aspects are included in the concept of UX in this study.</p>

              <p>The AR-system is based on the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform and IEEE Draft Standard for an Augmented Reality Learning Experience Mode. The whole system is configured around the Activity and Workplace JSON files. The Workplace JSON describes workplace-related information such as points of interest, sensors, etc. It is parsed with the Workplace manager and information is transferred to the data layer. The Activity JSON describes all action steps and the content that should be active for each step. It is parsed with the Activity manager and information is transferred to the AR layer via local storage. The current version can annotate:</p>

                <p>The use case is based on the on-board training and remote support scenario, or more precisely, the Centralized Cabin Filter (CCF) Replacement procedure in International Space Station (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). At present, the complete CCF Replacement task takes about 1 h and includes the performance of two referenced procedures (1.201 COL Deck Rack D1/D2/D3 Open &amp; Close and the 2.6.665 Portable O2 Monitor—Sampling Operations). With this use case, we intend to demonstrate that the EdcAR system is able not only to support, but also to instruct the users, on how to perform procedural tasks, in this case the ISS crew (Tedone et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p>

                <p>Furthermore, it is understood that the crews of the ISS or other manned space exploration missions will have to face unanticipated situations. At that point, it is important that the crew is able to receive training in real-time in order to perform a required, unforseen task. In this scenario, a possible solution could be that a brand new hands-on lesson, or procedure is developed on the ground with the use of the AR-system, and digitally sent to the ISS, or the spacecraft. The crew, which have never been trained for this specific task will then be able to execute it, thanks to the guidance provided by the AR-system in On-board Training application.</p>
                <p>Exploiting the AR-system, the operator will use a tablet that provides a global view of the training scenario and AR glasses for annotated information. For <italic>ad-hoc</italic> remote support, ground control will be able to view video streaming from the astronaut's glasses, as well as tracking information. The following section describes the five-step procedure:</p>

                  <p>In the first project (EdcAR), the development team evaluated the user experience and usability by observing the user test. The observations were written down while the users were testing the system, based on the comments, and performances of the users. The idea of the evaluation was to allow the users comment freely their experience, without predetermined questions or framework, and thus let the users define what is significant for them. The approach was applicable also because of the small amount of test users. After the test, the development team summarized the written observations and drew the conclusions.</p>

                  <p>SUS is a tool for measuring both usability and learnability. The SUS scores calculated from individual questionnaires represent the system usability. SUS yields a single number representing a composite measure of the overall usability of the system being studied. Scores for individual items are not meaningful on their own. SUS scores have a range of 0 to 100 (Brooke, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). According to validation studies, the acceptable SUS score is about 70 (Bangor et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Brooke, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p>

                  <p>SGUS questionnaire was created for the WEKIT trials. SGUS measures subjective satisfaction focusing especially on test participants' experiences on the features that support learning. SGUS is based on the evaluation criteria for web-based learning by Ssemugabi and de Villiers (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and statements taken from Olsson (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) “Concepts and Subjective Measures for Evaluating User Experience of Mobile Augmented Reality Services.” SGUS consists of 11 items (statements) with a seven point Likert scale (1–7).</p>

The participants to be interviewed were chosen randomly according to the availability of the participants and to avoid wasting their time (i.e., in a group of 3 people, the first one who finished was interviewed while waiting for his/her colleagues to finish the test). The interviews consisted of four main questions or themes: (1) Please use 2–3 words (adjectives) to describe your experience with AR glasses and the player during the execution of the task; (2) Please describe freely your experience on using the player during the execution of the task; (3) How well did you manage to complete the task with the player?; (4) Please tell the good and bad sides of AR glasses (HoloLens). Two to three positive and negative aspects.</p>

                <p>Based on the observation and expert evaluation of the ISS-Columbus mockups use-case, the HoloLens based AR-system is usable for basic daily use as its usability has reached a reasonable level. The 3D space user interface and annotations were working properly without any delay and the image quality was high enough for see-through glasses. The main downside of the system is the narrow field of view, the user has to move his/her head around and search for the information in some cases. Test subjects also highlight the potential of applying AR technology to this field, but AR-systems UI should be update to support Operations Data File (ODF) format which is common in the space domain.</p>

Thus, the WEKIT applications were considered nearly acceptable in terms of system usability. There is a clear difference between student and expert groups in deviation, indicating that there was a greater variation in the experience of system usability in student group.

                <p>The analysis of the Questionnaire for <bold>User Interaction Satisfaction (QUIS)</bold> showed that the scores were close to the average score for most of the questions. Taking a closer look at scores above or below the average, it was possible to assess that the current (HoloLens) version of AR is not yet considered fully reliable by the users, where the characters on display were found a bit hard to read and the organization of the information on the display was a bit too confusing and inconsistent. These results were observed in particular in the answers of the students.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the experience with AR glasses for performing that kind of task was considered good for both the experts, and the students, that found it easier to learn how to operate on such a task being guided by AR instructions (see Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p>

                  <p>The overall experience on the AR system was quite positive for the interviewees, since only three negative descriptions resulted from the interviews. The experienced frustration was related to the lagging of the system and speech recognition. The commands had to be repeated several times, probably because of improper pronunciation. Because of repetition of commands, the task sequence sometimes moved on two steps instead of one. Additionally, it was difficult to know where to look especially when looking for video guidance. Watching or finding the visual cues caused some problems. For one interviewee, this caused problems during the task performance, which the person defined as embarrassing. Audio instructions seemed to create mixed opinions: some participants appreciated them while others found visuals are better than audio.</p>

              <title>Conclusions and discussion</title>
              <p>The evaluation results of user experience in two AR user studies are presented in this paper. The main emphasis was on data collection and analysis of the EU WEKIT project case with real astronaut installation procedure on a physical mock-up of an ISS module.</p>
              <p>The aim of both studies was to develop and improve an AR system for astronauts' manual work and these studies are closely linked. The number of test participants in the first case (EdcAR) was 14 and in the second case (WEKIT) 39. According to the recent review of AR usability studies (Dey et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), 12 to 18 participants per study is a typical range in the AR community. While the first user study falls into this category, the second differs significantly with a higher number of participants. However, the two studies can be considered as phases of one larger study, and thus with the complete number of over 50 participants, this study provided a good ground for evaluating the user experience on this stage of prototype development.</p>
              <p>Based on the results, the overall user experience of the AR system is quite satisfactory. The most common descriptions of the whole system or the HoloLens are “interesting,” “useful,” “easy,” “engaging” and “comfortable,” whereas the questionnaire results indicate that the system has a very strong potential; to e.g., captivate attention positively and support task accomplishment effectively.</p>
              <p>As the AR-system usability has reached a reasonable level (average SUS score 68), both the pragmatic and emotional aspects of the user experience were considered fulfilling. It can be suggested that the AR-system is potentially a useful tool for supporting and facilitating the assembly and training procedure in the space field, even though the tool is still in prototyping phase and it will be updated after the next trials in WEKIT project.</p>
              <p>There are however many usability issues still to be resolved. For instance, the narrow field-of-view is one the most significant issues.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the experienced problems in perceiving the work area and finding or noticing AR objects could be solved by enhancing visual guidance (e.g., 360° guidance and animated lines for locating objects), providing clear orientation to the task and by providing instructive materials of the area (maps, 3D models etc.)</p>
              <p>From the technical point-of-view, the main indications to operate the AR-system inside the ISS-Columbus module on orbit were investigated and aspects related to the system integration were considered: (1) in order to operate the proper selection of the COTS items requesting only minor changes for operations in the ISS, (2) in order to highlight possible criticisms and critical technologies to be further investigated in the prototype design, assembly and testing phases, and (3) in order to address the design of the flight concept.</p>
              <p>The developed system has been already tested and evaluated in two other domains: bioimaging and aircraft maintenance. These tests were completed together with the EU-WEKIT project. Microsoft HoloLens AR-system worked properly and its usability has a reasonable level for performing the required task. Over 40 persons from another domain evaluated the AR-system. This shows that current system is also suitable for other domains.</p>
