              <abstract>
                <p>Pronuclear migration, which is the initial stage of embryonic development and the marker of zygote formation, is a crucial process during mammalian preimplantation embryonic development. Recent studies have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve an important role in early embryonic development. However, the functional regulation of lncRNAs in this process has yet to be elucidated, largely due to the difficulty of assessing gene expression alterations during the very short time in which pronuclear migration occurs. It has previously been reported that migration of the pronucleus of a zygote can be obstructed by simulated microgravity. To investigate pronuclear migration in mice, a rotary cell culture system was employed, which generates simulated microgravity, in order to interfere with murine pronuclear migration. Subsequently, lncRNA sequencing was performed to investigate the mechanism underlying this process. In the present study, a comprehensive analysis of lncRNA profile during the mouse pronuclear stage was conducted, in which 3,307 lncRNAs were identified based on single-cell RNA sequencing data. Furthermore, 52 lncRNAs were identified that were significantly differentially expressed. Subsequently, 10 lncRNAs were selected for validation by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in which the same relative expression pattern was observed. The results revealed that 12 lncRNAs (lnc006745, lnc007956, lnc013100, lnc013782, lnc017097, lnc019869, lnc025838, lnc027046, lnc005454, lnc007956, lnc019410 and lnc019607), with tubulin β 4B class IVb or actinin α 4 as target genes, may be associated with the expression of microtubule and microfilament proteins. Binding association was confirmed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs participated in cellular processes associated with protein transport, binding, catalytic activity, membrane-bounded organelle, protein complex and the cortical cytoskeleton. These findings suggested that these lncRNAs may be associated with migration of the mouse pronucleus.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>In mice, the pronuclear stage is a vital period in which the activation of zygotic genes begins (<xref rid="b1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="b3-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). During the pronuclear stage, the zygote undergoes meiosis to form the female pronucleus, and serial reactions in the sperm nucleus occur to form the male pronucleus. In a previous study, it was reported that female and male pronuclear migration in zygotes depends on microtubules and organelles (<xref rid="b4-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and that simulated microgravity, generated by a rotary cell culture system (RCCS), disturbs spindle organization to inhibit mouse oocyte maturation (<xref rid="b6-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), as the microtubules and chromosomes cannot form a complete spindle.</p>
              <p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which evolve rapidly and demonstrate little if any sequence conservation (<xref rid="b7-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), are spliced transcripts that do not encode proteins; lncRNAs range in length from 200 to several thousand nucleotides. Previous studies have reported that there are &gt;1,000 promoter-associated non-coding RNA/gene pairs at the time of zygotic gene activation (ZGA) (<xref rid="b8-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), ~5,563 novel lncRNAs in mouse cleavage-stage embryos (<xref rid="b9-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and 2,733 novel lncRNAs in human preimplantation embryos, as determined via single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) (<xref rid="b10-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Numerous lncRNAs have been revealed to serve key roles in post-transcriptional, translational and epigenetic regulation, and in embryogenesis without having any apparent function (<xref rid="b11-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="b15-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Some lncRNAs associate with promoters to activate partner gene expression (<xref rid="b8-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Previous investigations have mainly focused on early oocytes or later embryonic development, and the global gene expression profiles of lncRNAs have been revealed using single-cell RNA-Seq (<xref rid="b10-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b16-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="b22-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the biological functions of lncRNAs in mouse pronuclear migration are not well understood.</p>
              <p>Although previous studies have investigated whether the disruption of microtubules inhibits pronuclear migration in mouse zygotes, it remains unclear as to whether these microtubular abnormalities are induced by lncRNAs. Therefore, a RCCS was used to generate a model of pronuclear migration defects, and the relative lncRNA expression patterns in the mouse zygote were investigated to understand the biological roles of lncRNAs during pronuclear migration.</p>

                  <p>All animal procedures were carried out according to the guidelines developed by the China Council on Animal Care, and the protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China). Mice were maintained under the following conditions: Temperature, 18–22°C; humidity, 50–60%; 10–14 h light/dark cycle; <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to food and water. Superovulation of 20 adult female mice (C57BL/6; age, 6–12-weeks; weight, 18–25 g; Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, Foshan, China) was induced via intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Ningbo Second Hormone Factory, Ningbo, China), followed by injection of 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Ningbo Second Hormone Factory) after 48 h. The mice were then placed in individual cages with an adult male mouse (C57BL/6; age, 8–24 weeks; weight, 20–50 g; Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center). The female mice were screened for vaginal plugs the following morning (15 h post-hCG), and mice with vaginal plugs were subsequently dissected for collect ion of their zygotes. A total of 16 h following hCG administration, the zygotes were collected from the ampullae of the oviducts, and the cumulus cells were removed with 300 IU/ml hyaluronidase. The zygotes were subsequently cultured in potassium simplex optimization medium supplemented with a solution of 1% Eagle's Basal Medium and Minimum Essential Media non-essential amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, UK), 95 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.35 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.71 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM bovine serum albumin, 1 mM glutamine, 0.2 mM pyruvate, 10 mM sodium DL-lactate, 0.2 mM D-glucose, 0.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.01 mM EDTA, and were overlaid with embryo-tested mineral oil in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).</p>
                  <p>A total of 20 h post-hCG administration, when the pronucleus was observable, the zygotes were randomly divided into two groups (50 zygotes/group). One group was cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> under normal gravity for 9 h (three repetitions, groups C1, C2 and C3), after which, the zygotes (in which the pronuclei were adjacent to each other) were collected immediately. The other group was cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in the RCCS (Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA), under simulated microgravity for 9 h, as described previously (three repetitions, groups R1, R2 and R3) (<xref rid="b6-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The zygotes exhibiting disrupted pronuclear migration were collected immediately. Zygotes collected from the two groups were transferred to 80 µl RNA extraction buffer (Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit; Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) for RNA isolation and were stored at −80°C until sequencing.</p>

Subsequently, single-cell cDNA was purified with the Ampure XP kit (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The concentration and fragment distribution of the single-cell cDNA obtained from normal gravity and simulated microgravity zygote samples were subsequently assessed in a Qubit<sup>®</sup> 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and the High Sensitivity DNA Assay kit in the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).</p>
                  <p>Single-cell cDNA (20 ng) was used as the initial material for library construction. Initially, a Bioruptor<sup>®</sup> Sonication system (20–60 kHz; 4°C; 30 sec; Diagenode, Inc., Denville, NJ, USA) was employed to generate small fragments ~300 bp in length. Subsequently, the library fragments were subjected to end repair via the addition of a poly(A) tail and an adapter sequence. The Beckman Ampure XP kit was used to purify fragments after each reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was subsequently performed, and different index tags, which were used for distinguishing samples from each other during sequencing, were added to each sample. The PCR products were retrieved via 2% agarose gel electrophoresis in order to select for 4,000-bp DNA fragments, from which the library was constructed. The Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was then used to assess the quality of the libraries.</p>

                  <p>The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) using 150-bp paired-end sequencing. Sequencing reads were assessed with the FASTX tool kit (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/">http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/</uri>) and were then subjected to standard quality control criteria to remove short (&lt;30 bp) and low-quality (quality score &lt;20) reads. After trimming the adaptor sequences, high-quality clean reads were obtained for the following analysis. Firstly, the reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm9; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">genome.ucsc.edu/</uri>) with TopHat v1.4.0 software, assembled with Cufflinks v2.2.0 and annotated with RefSeq (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq</uri>) to remove the annotated genes known to encode proteins or small RNAs (<xref rid="b24-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Genes/transcripts with fragments per kilobase transcriptome per million reads (FPKM) &gt;10 were retained, meaning that if there was only one exon, the length could be &gt;2,000 bp, whereas if more than two exons were present, the length could be &gt;200 bp. The coding potential of the transcripts was then identified by CPC 2.0 software; subsequently, transcripts with coding potential were excluded, and the final lncRNAs were obtained (<xref rid="b25-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Finally, the read counts for each novel transcript were converted into FPKM, values which were used to calculate gene expression.</p>

Total RNA was extracted from 100 fertilized embryos using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA then underwent RT using the PrimeScript™ RT Reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (perfect real time; Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan). The relative expression levels of the target lncRNAs were measured by RT-qPCR using the Power SYBR-Green RT-PCR kit (Toyobo Life Science, Osaka, Japan) in a Bio-Rad CFX96 PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). H2A histone family member Z was employed as a housekeeping gene, and each sample was analysed three times. The lncRNA-specific PCR conditions were as follows: Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 sec, annealing at 60°C for 10 sec and extension at 72°C for 30 sec.

The stage-specific lncRNAs, showing differential expression between the two groups, and their target genes were chosen to construct the network. For further analysis, tubulin β-4B class IVb (<italic>Tubb4b</italic>) and lnc007956 were chosen to validate the association between a target gene and lncRNA. However, it is difficult to induce gene transfer in early embryos. The 293FT cell line has the advantage of easier culture, higher transfer efficiency and easier experimental operation; it is usually used to verify the target association of microRNA/lncRNAs in mammalian cells (<xref rid="b29-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In the present study, 293FT cells (cat. no. R70007; Thermo Fisher Scientific), which were grown to 70–80% confluence in 96-well plates, were co-transfected with a dual-luciferase reporter (cat. no.

V795-20; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.] using Lipofectamine<sup>®</sup> 3000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 h.

This experiment was repeated more than three times and results were analysed using a Student's t-test (Microsoft Excel 2010; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). P&lt;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.</p>
                  <p>LncRNA functions were predicted based on the corresponding target genes through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis.

                  <p>To investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on mouse pronuclear migration, zygotes in which the male and female pronuclei were forming were cultured for spontaneous maturation under RCCS (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) or normal gravity (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) conditions for 9 h. Subsequently, the zygotes cultured under simulated microgravity were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> under normal gravity for 10 h (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) and 40 h, whereas the culture conditions for the control group were unchanged. Subsequently, for each group, the proportions of complete pronuclear migration, and of embryos at the 2-cell and 4-cell stages, were recorded following the onset of embryonic development (<xref rid="tII-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). During further culture, the control zygotes exhibited orderly embryonic development (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), whereas those in the simulated microgravity group were stalled at the pronuclear merge stage (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The zygotes cultured in the RCCS completed pronuclear migration after 10 h under normal gravity (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) but could not progress to the 2-cell stage (<xref rid="tII-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>). The present study further investigated whether tubulin protein expression was altered in the two groups using immunofluorescence; tubulin protein was disturbed in the RCCS group (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>) compared with in the control group (<xref rid="f1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-J</xref>), which tubulin protein had assembled nearby the male and female pronuclei.

Low-quality reads were filtered, and the clean reads still included &gt;81.58% of the raw data.

                  <p>After the removal of protein-coding genes and transcripts that were &lt;200 bp, a total of 6,254 novel lncRNA transcripts were obtained from the 3,307 expressed loci in the RNA-Seq analysis. The lncRNAs varied between 200 and 7,804 bp in length, with 45.8% falling between 200 and 1,000 bp, 36.3% between 1,000 and 2,000 bp, 13.1% between 2,000 and 3,000 bp, 4.4% between 3,000 and 5,000 bp, and 0.4% between 5,000 and 10,000 bp (<xref rid="f2-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The lncRNA genes had an average length of 1,305 bp, and the lncRNA transcripts were mainly located on mouse chromosomes 1–19 and X (<xref rid="f2-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).

Subsequently, a lncRNA-gene interaction network between differentially expressed lncRNAs and their target genes was constructed with Cytoscape software. A total of 668 network nodes (40 lncRNAs and 628 protein-coding genes) and 2,289 lncRNA-gene connections were identified in the network (data not shown). Furthermore, 12 lncRNA-gene pairs [lnc006745-actinin-α4 (<italic>Actn4</italic>), lnc007956-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc013100-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc013782-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc017097-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc019869-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc025838-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc027046-<italic>Actn4</italic>, lnc005454-<italic>Tubb4b</italic>, lnc007956-<italic>Tubb4b</italic>, lnc019410-<italic>Tubb4b</italic> and lnc019607-<italic>Tubb4b</italic>] that may be associated with pronuclear migration were identified (<xref rid="f4-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>
                  <p>To further determine whether lnc007956 binds directly to <italic>Tubb4b</italic>, two dual-luciferase reporter vectors were constructed, with the wild-type or mutant target sequence of <italic>Tubb4</italic>, inserted at the 3′ end of the firefly luciferase gene.

              <p>In mice, the completion of pronuclear migration is a crucial step in ZGA and serves an important role in development of the early embryo. To generate a model of pronuclear migration defects, in order to evaluate the role of pronuclear progression during early embryonic development, an RCCS was used to simulate microgravity conditions in a previous study and was revealed to inhibit polar body extrusion by disrupting microtubule organization during mouse oocyte maturation (<xref rid="b6-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To investigate the progress of pronuclear migration, simulated microgravity was used to alter the organization of the microtubules in mouse zygotes and it was demonstrated that zygotes cultured under simulated microgravity exhibit a delay in the assembly of male and female pronuclei, and that progression to the 2-cell stage is also affected. As ZGA begins approximately at the pronuclear stage and transcription of a wide variety of transcripts occurs at the 2-cell stage in mice (<xref rid="b1-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), zygotes with defects in pronuclear migration may possess altered activation of specific genes at the pronuclear stage, which are required for progression to the 2-cell stage. The present results suggested that simulated microgravity altered gene expression in mouse zygotes to prevent progression to the 2-cell stage; therefore, zygotes cultured in the RCCS represent a good model for studying the impact of pronuclear migration in mice.</p>
              <p>Increasing number of mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles during early embryonic development have been obtained via single-cell RNA-Seq (<xref rid="b10-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and the molecular mechanisms by which many of these RNAs modulate early embryonic development have been elucidated (<xref rid="b20-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b31-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). However, whether alterations in genes associated with pronuclear migration are regulated by mRNA/lncRNAs remains unknown. Based on the high resolution of RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq can be used to examine rare cell types, identify molecules of low abundance, capture brief events and detect weak associations masked in bulk experiments (<xref rid="b33-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq represents a promising tool for exploring the expression levels of lncRNAs in mouse pronuclear migration; this approach was used in the present study to elucidate the lncRNA profile during mouse pronuclear migration and identified 6,254 novel lncRNA transcripts from the 3,307 expressed loci. In addition, previous studies identified 5,563 novel lncRNAs in mouse cleavage-stage embryos (<xref rid="b9-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and 2,733 novel lncRNAs in human preimplantation embryos (<xref rid="b10-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), thus confirming that there are numerous lncRNAs present during early mammalian embryonic development and that lncRNAs may serve a vital role in the pronuclear stage. Through further investigation, 52 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified and 10 of these lncRNAs were selected to validate the accuracy of the RNA-Seq results via RT-qPCR. The RT-qPCR results were concordant with the RNA-Seq results, demonstrating that the results of single-cell RNA-Seq were reliable.</p>
              <p>It remains unclear as to how many lncRNAs are involved in mouse pronuclear migration. Therefore, the functions of lncRNAs were predicted based on their association with known protein-coding genes and a lncRNA-target gene co-expression network was constructed. Subsequently, based on the identification of <italic>Tubb4b</italic> and <italic>Actn4</italic> as target genes, 12 lncRNAs linked to microfilaments and microtubules were identified, which may affect mouse pronuclear migration. It has been reported that microfilaments and microtubules are essential proteins for male and female pronuclei (<xref rid="b3-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b35-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="b37-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). During mouse pronuclear migration, specific tools and associated proteins (such as microfilaments and microtubules) become activated, and the sperm centrosome forms a sperm aster, to bring the male and female pronuclei together to complete migration (<xref rid="b3-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b37-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>
              <p>Tubulins, which include eight α and nine β isotypes, are the proteins that form microtubules, which are cytoskeletal elements of all eukaryotic cells that participate in various essential cellular functions (<xref rid="b38-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). <italic>Tubb4b</italic>, also referred to as the tubulin β-2C chain, is tightly associated with active spermatogenesis in mice (<xref rid="b39-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). <italic>Actn4</italic> belongs to the α-actinin family of cytoskeletal proteins that display unique characteristics associated with cytoskeletal organization, signal transduction, regulation of gene expression, protecting cells from mechanical stress and controlling cell movement (<xref rid="b40-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–<xref rid="b42-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Actn4</italic> expression in keratinocytes and murine lung fibroblasts not only impairs the directionality of cell migration but also reduces cell proliferation (<xref rid="b43-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In the dual-luciferase reporter assay, lnc007956 was revealed to bind to the predicted binding site in <italic>Tubb4b</italic> mRNA, thus indicating that lnc007956 may regulate mouse pronuclear migration by binding to <italic>Tubb4b</italic>. Therefore, lncRNAs may be considered to regulate mouse pronuclear migration, and lncRNA defects could result in abnormalities of microtubules and microfilaments.</p>
              <p>According to GO analysis, lncRNA target genes were independently enriched in cellular process-associated terms, including protein transport, binding, catalytic activity, membrane-bounded organelle, protein complex and cortical cytoskeleton. In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos, migration of the female pronucleus is associated with organelles, which promote the movement of the female pronucleus along the microtubules to the sperm centrosome (<xref rid="b35-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-mmr-19-01-0155" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). LncRNAs may control the molecules involved in this process in mice, thereby affecting mouse pronuclear migration. Notably, these data greatly improve the understanding of early embryonic development and may lead to the development of highly efficient markers for analysing the molecular mechanisms of zygote pronuclear migration. The present study provided basic data, which may improve the treatment of physiological reproductive disorders.</p>
