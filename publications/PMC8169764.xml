                <p id="Par1">Exposure to microgravity affects human physiology in various ways, and astronauts frequently report skin-related problems. Skin rash and irritation are frequent complaints during space missions, and skin thinning has also been reported after returning to Earth. However, spaceflight missions for studying the physiological changes in microgravity are impractical. Thus, we used a previously developed 3D clinostat to simulate a microgravity environment and investigate whether physiological changes of the skin can be reproduced in a 3D in vitro setting. Our results showed that under time-averaged simulated microgravity (taSMG), the thickness of the endothelial cell arrangement increased by up to 59.75%, indicating skin irritation due to vasodilation, and that the diameter of keratinocytes and fibroblast co-cultured spheroids decreased by 6.66%, representing skin thinning. The Î±1 chain of type I collagen was upregulated, while the connective tissue growth factor was downregulated under taSMG. Cytokeratin-10 expression was significantly increased in the taSMG environment. The clinostat-based 3D culture system can reproduce physiological changes in the skin similar to those under microgravity, providing insight for understanding the effects of microgravity on human health before space exploration.</p>

              <p id="Par2">During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to microgravity, which has various effects on human physiology. Bone and muscle mass are decreased, brain structures are altered, and intravascular fluid is redistributed after exposure to microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. One of the organs that is most affected is the skin. In a review of the electronic medical records of long-duration International Space Station (ISS) crew members, skin rashes and hypersensitivity were the most frequently reported conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) found that skin irritation and rash were the most frequently reported complaints during ISS missions, with a 0.69 person-year incidence for both complaints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Dermatitis, skin peeling, and infection have also been reported as dermatology disorders occurring in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Skin thinning and loss of elasticity occur in astronauts after space flight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Similar results were observed in a study of mice which spent 3 months in the ISS. The dermal thickness of mice exposed to prolonged microgravity was reduced by 15% compared to that of controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the same study, the authors found that collagen turnover was increased.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Endothelial cells, which are the major component of dermal blood vessels, are also affected by microgravity. Shi et al. reported that one day of exposure to simulated microgravity (SMG) promotes angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Carlsson et al. found that microgravity stimulated endothelial cell growth and changed the morphology of the cellular structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Altered angiogenesis has been implicated in chronic inflammatory skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis as well as skin irritation, which is the most frequently reported skin problem in astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Conducting a spaceflight mission to study the physiologic changes in microgravity is impractical because of the high cost and inaccessibility. To overcome these limitations, clinostats have been developed to simulate microgravity environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A 3D clinostat is constructed from two perpendicular frames that rotate independently. The direction of the gravity vector is constantly changed so that the average of the gravity vector simulates a microgravity environment. We previously developed a 3D clinostat and validated its performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Using a novel algorithm, the clinostat generated an evenly distributed time-averaged SMG (taSMG) condition.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Many studies have focused on the effects of space travel using 2D culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, in vitro mimicry studies that directly compared cellular changes using 3D culture technique in 1âG and SMG environments were insufficient and limited because of differences in the culture settings of SMG. Some characteristics of cells cannot be modeled in 2D culture, and 3D culture such as spheroids or organoids can better reproduce responses that occur in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Scaffold-based 3D skin equivalent models, which represent the actual skin in a more structurally closer and physiological way, have also been developed but can be more costly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. According to various studies using 3D models, the increased dimension of the extracellular matrix around the cell can significantly affect cell properties such as interactions between cells, morphology, proliferation, mechanical response, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, this study was conducted to use a previously developed 3D clinostat to simulate a microgravity environment and investigate whether physiological changes of the skin can be reproduced in a 3D in vitro setting.</p>

                <p id="Par8">The arrangement of endothelial cells was thicker in Matrigel under a taSMG than under the 1âG environment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The 1G-to-taSMG group, which was incubated at 1âG and then transferred to taSMG, also showed an increase in thickness compared to the 1âG group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par12">Alterations in physiological properties in space have been broadly reported, with the literature suggesting that biological changes occur within the cellular environment of human cells exposed to microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Astronauts repeatedly reported that they suffer from skin-related problems according to a study by the NASA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thinning of the skin layer and alteration in collagen contents have been reported in a space mouse model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These findings strongly suggest that the physiology and structure of the skin are altered by microgravity. However, the effects of microgravity at the cellular level are not well-understood. Thus, we reproduced physiological changes in skin cell-based in vitro spheroids under taSMG using a previously developed clinostat to improve the understanding of gravitational effects on 3D cultured cells.</p>
              <p id="Par13">To investigate whether taSMG can induce in vitro angiogenesis, which has been implicated in chronic skin inflammatory disorders and skin irritation, a tube formation assay was conducted. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, the thickness of endothelial cell arrangement formed under the taSMG environment was significantly increased. The observed increase in thickness under taSMG can explain the potential for skin irritation because the dilation and increased permeability of blood vessels produces erythema and edema, which are hallmarks of skin irritation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Thus, microgravity-exposed skin may be vulnerable to skin irritation and inflammatory skin disorders via increased angiogenesis. Additionally, the facial fullness and headache reported by astronauts may be related to the increased permeability or dilation of blood vessels during space adaptation, as taSMG increased the thickness of endothelial cell arrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Skin thinning is another phenomenon observed under microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The previously investigated mouse model showed a significant reduction in the dermal thickness similar to our results showing that the dermal component area of the spheroid was significantly reduced in size (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Further, skin physiology research on astronauts indicated thinning of the dermal matrix, which may be related to the expression of MMP-1 and CCN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Reduced expression of CCN2 has been shown to cause defective adhesion to fibronectin, which plays a major role in cell adhesion and maintenance of the cellular structure and shape, among other functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The previously reported thinning of the astronautâs dermal matrix may be associated with fibronectin impairment, as indicated by the results showing that taSMG reduced CCN2 expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of COL1A1, which forms part of a large molecule known as type I collagen, was significantly upregulated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). The total collagen contents determined in the hydroxyproline assay at day 7 were significantly increased which can be explained by the upregulation of COL1A1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Collagen expression by fibroblasts requires a sufficient period of time after seeding and is highly dependent on the 3D-surrounding. Therefore, the absence of a significant change in collagen content at day 3 seems to be due to the short experiment time. Our findings show that the SMG environment generated by the clinostat can reproduce dermal thinning and induce changes in gene expression compared to those in a normal gravitational environment. In a previous study, CCN1 and CCN2 expression was shown to be upregulated in an actual microgravity environment, which contrasts our findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In another study using thyroid carcinoma spheroids, the expression of CCN2 was downregulated, similar to that in our study. The first study was limited by the small number of mice, resulting in questionable statistical reliability. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a difference in gene expression between the taSMG and real microgravity environments. Therefore, further studies are required to fully understand this difference.</p>
              <p id="Par15">The decrease in thickness of the keratinocyte layer of spheroids under taSMG is similar to the decrease in the thickness of the stratum corneum of an astronaut (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). However, in co-cultured spheroids, the thickness of the keratinocyte layer decreased and the viability of keratinocytes increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This unexpected result could be related to the size of keratinocytes in co-cultured spheroids. As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, the reduction in the size of keratinocytes in taSMG environment would have resulted in the formation of more dense structures and increasing viability while decreasing the thickness. Moreover, K10 expression was significantly increased under taSMG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). K10 is important for maintaining epidermal homeostasis, and its expression is known to increase following acute and chronic skin barrier disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that the taSMG environment induced skin barrier disruption; however, further studies are needed to fully explain this phenomenon. Overall, our results indicate that taSMG produced by the 3D clinostat can reproduce the reported physiological and structural changes of skin components and enable investigation under microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p id="Par16">This study had several limitations. First, our co-cultured spheroid model only consists of two cell types and therefore is not completely identical to real skin. Also, the 3D culture of fibroblast cells is a simulation of one of the dermal cells of the skin, but cannot represent the dermal layer itself. Although co-cultured spheroids under taSMG can partially reproduce reported effects and physiological modulation, the culture environment must be further optimized. This will enable analysis of various cell types under taSMG. Organ-on-a-chip-based culture platform may be applied to the 3D clinostat environment to further investigate various phenomena within the chip models under taSMG. A microfluidic chip model would provide a better nutritional supply for the cells, spheroids, or organoids for a longer experimental period. Second, we examined spheroids and endothelial cell arrangement for only 3 days and 24âh, respectively. However, long-term ISS stays can span several months. There may be some limitations when explaining cellular changes beyond the time period of our experiment. However, for practical reasons, most previous studies observing changes in cells cultured under SMG were performed for less than a week<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Third, HaCaT is an immortalized keratinocyte cell line and does not reflect some features of normal human keratinocytes. HaCaT cells were used in this study to overcome the difficulties of culturing primary keratinocytes due to their short lifetime, donor-to-donor variability, and changes in characteristics according to the number of passages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Although they were widely used as a reliable substitute for human keratinocytes in previous studies, this limitation should be considered when interpreting the results of this study.</p>
              <p id="Par17">Although improvements in the culture protocol are needed, our taSMG in vitro culture system reproduced physiological modulation of the skin components similar to that observed in astronauts and mouse models. Experiments using the proposed system may improve the understanding of the effects of microgravity on human health prior to space exploration.</p>
