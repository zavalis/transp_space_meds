                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The built environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is a highly specialized space in terms of both physical characteristics and habitation requirements. It is unique with respect to conditions of microgravity, exposure to space radiation, and increased carbon dioxide concentrations. Additionally, astronauts inhabit a large proportion of this environment. The microbial composition of ISS particulates has been reported; however, its functional genomics, which are pertinent due to potential impact of its constituents on human health and operational mission success, are not yet characterized.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">This study examined the whole metagenome of ISS microbes at both species- and gene-level resolution. Air filter and dust samples from the ISS were analyzed and compared to samples collected in a terrestrial cleanroom environment. Furthermore, metagenome mining was carried out to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms. The whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains isolated from these samples were extracted from the metagenome and compared.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">Species-level composition in the ISS was found to be largely dominated by <italic>Corynebacterium ihumii</italic> GD7, with overall microbial diversity being lower in the ISS relative to the cleanroom samples. When examining detection of microbial genes relevant to human health such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, it was found that a larger number of relevant gene categories were observed in the ISS relative to the cleanroom. Strain-level cross-sample comparisons were made for <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> showing possible distinctions in the dominant strain between samples.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Conclusion</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Species-level analyses demonstrated distinct differences between the ISS and cleanroom samples, indicating that the cleanroom population is not necessarily reflective of space habitation environments. The overall population of viable microorganisms and the functional diversity inherent to this unique closed environment are of critical interest with respect to future space habitation. Observations and studies such as these will be important to evaluating the conditions required for long-term health of human occupants in such environments.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par5">The microbial content of built environments is an area of increasing study, particularly with the expansion of culture-independent sequence-based assessments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The ecology of indoor environments with continuous human contact is of great interest due to potential impact on human health; this is of particular concern in built environments that are spatially confined with long-term human occupants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These environments are typified by enclosures associated with extraterrestrial habitation. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a strong interest and motivation to understand the microbial content and ecology of these environments, particularly the International Space Station (ISS) as a test bed for other analogs of closed systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and future human habitation on Mars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par6">Previous microbial assessments of the ISS have largely been restricted to the examination of smaller subsets of microorganisms using culture-based microbiology or quantitative PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Microbial survey units based on detection of specific bacterial biomarkers have also been deployed to the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further studies have used Sanger sequencing in an effort to identify a panel of potential pathogens in potable water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent examination of microbial content associated with astronauts has explored the degree to which the human microbiome adjusts to habitation within the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Implications of these data for maintenance of crew health are critical when evaluating design and maintenance of this highly specialized built environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Previous studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and others expanded on this knowledge base by applying bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicon sequencing for examination of broader microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These studies were coupled with propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment, eliminating detection of non-cellular DNA and DNA associated with cells exhibiting a compromised membrane, and providing culture-independent quantification of viable microorganisms. These studies revealed important distinctions in diversity between the built environments of the ISS and terrestrial cleanrooms from the Spacecraft Assembly Facility (SAF) at JPL, demonstrating that the ISS microbiome is strongly impacted by human skin-associated microbes.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Through application of Illumina and pyrosequencing techniques to targeted amplicons, these previous studies provided a broader survey of the bacterial and fungal microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. An inherent limitation of amplicon sequencing, however, is that the wider metagenome is not examined, which limits taxonomic resolution and prohibits a study of the functional genetic content of the microbiome. Knowledge of the functional capabilities of the microbiome could be critical to determining whether the population poses a potential threat to human health. Recent studies have just begun to explore the potential of whole metagenome data for examining the functional genomics of microbial communities associated with spacecraft in a terrestrial environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Further application of these techniques to space habitats will be critical. It has been suggested that the immune profile of astronauts may be modulated following exposure to microgravity and space travel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; thus, the response to microbial presence and activity may be difficult to predict, and a complete portrait of that activity is important to risk assessment.</p>
              <p id="Par9">Of particular interest is the genetic potential for resistance to antimicrobials, as the presence of such microorganisms could significantly jeopardize health both during and after completion of the mission. To more thoroughly assess these factors, a whole metagenome sequencing approach to analyze both the ISS and SAF environments was undertaken. Samples from high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters and dust from within the ISS cabin as well as dust from the JPL-SAF were analyzed. As in the previous JPL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], samples were either processed directly or pre-treated with PMA to assess intact, presumably viable microbes, and resultant sequence data were examined for population abundance, functional genomic characterization, and phylogenetic relationships. Furthermore, metagenome mining was conducted to characterize dominant, virulent, and novel microorganisms by comparing the whole genome sequences of select cultivable strains from these samples.</p>

                <p id="Par10">Materials collected from three sample types examined as part of this study included the following: ISS filter particles obtained from HEPA systems onboard the space station (ISS filter), ISS dust samples obtained through vacuum collection within the cabin (ISS dust), and dust samples obtained through vacuum collection from a cleanroom where spacecraft are assembled (SAF dust). Portions of the cargo destined for the ISS are prepared in cleanrooms (class 100K) such as the SAF, where spacecraft are assembled; thus, any pre-existing commonality between the environments, derived from this subset of components, was of interest. Due to low biomass limitations in the availability of these materials, one sample was analyzed for each group. However, about 1 g of particulate materials was aseptically scraped from the HEPA filter and from the vacuum cleaner bags. These samples were either untreated to examine total microbial burden or subjected to PMA treatment to examine viable microbial content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>

The materials collected using the HEPA filter system (40 months old) are representative of circulating air, and the vacuum cleaner bag was representative of fixed ISS (1-day collection) or JPL-SAF (180 days) surfaces. Reagent and water controls for DNA extraction, PCR, and no-template negative controls were also included in this study. Molecular microbial community analyses, based on amplification of bacterial 16S regions and fungal ITS regions, have been previously documented for the ISS filter, ISS dust, and SAF dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

                <p id="Par31">Alpha diversity and richness estimates were calculated from absolute read counts without rarefying to an even depth so as to minimize data loss and include low abundant species detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). It is anticipated that the cutoffs applied by LMAT will reduce noise within the data so as to minimize impact of library size-dependent sequence noise on calculated diversity metrics. Both the assessed dust samples obtained from the ISS and those obtained from the SAF trended toward greater microbial diversity than filter samples; however, our study is not designed to test for differences in diversity between many possible factors; thus, significance cannot be confidently assigned. The Chao1 estimator, Shannon entropy, and Simpson index highlight different aspects of the species diversity in the samples. The Chao1 richness estimate shows that PMA-treated samples (triangles) are trending toward a lower expected number of species, as might be expected when examining the smaller subset of viable microorganisms. However, within the two SAF samples, the Shannon and Simpson indices suggest that PMA treatment resulted in higher species evenness, despite the lower richness estimate. It is possible that there is a small number of non-viable species composing the majority of sequence data in untreated samples, saturating available detectable sequence. Removal of these species by PMA treatment may have allowed for the detection of a broader range of viable microorganisms, increasing observed diversity. This observation could also be due to novel species having attributable sequence reads split between multiple near-neighbor references, resulting in an amplified observed diversity metric. While these hypotheses are offered as possible explanations, it needs to be noted that feasibility limitations in sample size make it difficult to perform a confident assessment of relative richness/diversity.</p>
                <p id="Par32">Principal coordinate analysis of the samples was performed using Bray-Curtis distances based on raw read accounts of all microbes. ISS filter and dust microbial populations were observed to demonstrate a visually distinct profile from the SAF dust within the ordination space (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). PERMANOVA analysis revealed that this difference was not highly significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18), though given the drastically different environments, we expect further sampling would likely show this difference to be significant. No significant differences were observed in the distance between samples when grouped according to treatment status (untreated vs. PMA) or type (dust vs. filter).</p>

This analysis illustrates, as a network, how each taxonomic class was distributed across PMA-treated samples, providing a visual representation of which taxa were observed as shared versus unique to a given sample type. The taxa used to perform this analysis were identified using an alternative sequence mapping approach (DIAMOND, as described in the “Methods”), as opposed to LMAT, to facilitate incorporation within the MEGAN5 pipeline. The genus-level alignment results from this approach are shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figures S4-S6 and are comparable to those observed via LMAT. Taxa nodes shown as the same color as their corresponding sample node were unique to that sample, while gray taxa nodes were shared between two or three sample types. ISS dust and ISS filter samples shared the highest number of taxa at the class level, containing only one and five exclusively unique taxonomic classes, respectively. As was observed above, SAF dust composition was distinct from each of the ISS samples, exhibiting 54 unique classes not shared by the other two samples.</p>

The metagenomic data were mined to explore the presence of genetic signatures relevant to culture isolates from these samples, and the absolute numbers of unfiltered reads corresponding to the genomes of each isolated microorganism are depicted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Unfiltered reads were analyzed to maximize the detection of low abundance microorganisms. The LMAT reference database contained reference genomes for 17 of the 31 cultured isolates identified at the species level. Species not present in the LMAT reference database were not included in this analysis. It is likely that sequence reads corresponding to isolates not present in the database were assigned to near-neighbor species. In total, 12 bacterial and five fungal species present in the LMAT database were isolated using conventional cultivation methods. Among these cultivable microorganisms, eight, nine, and three species were cultivated from the ISS filter, ISS dust, and SAF dust samples, respectively. <italic>A. niger</italic> was the only fungal species cultured from both ISS samples and was also detected in both sequence datasets.

Sequence reads corresponding to virulence genes were binned into functional categories to combine genes contributing to similar mechanisms of virulence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). These include efflux proteins, transposases, methylases, and resistance to a range of antibiotics. There is substantial overlap between genes annotated as conferring AMR and those implicated in virulence; thus, a proportion of those shown are resistance associated. The identified AMR gene sets are not identical, however, due to distinctions between the CARD and VFDB databases.</p>
                <p id="Par38">A much lower quantity of sequence data was associated with virulence compared to AMR; however, a similar pattern of distribution was observed, in that the ISS dust was associated with the largest number of virulence categories and SAF dust the fewest. When compared with PMA-untreated samples, PMA treatment only resulted in a significant change in the number of detected virulence categories in the ISS filter (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.003, Fisher’s exact test). Despite the low total read count, reads are likely to be highly informative due to the strict filtering criteria applied. This provides confidence in the presence of a given virulence factor but does not indicate that our inability to detect any given virulence category substantiates its absence in a given sample.</p>

              <p id="Par46">Health of the crew during a space flight mission is of critical importance, both during the mission, as there is limited access to care, and upon return. With increasingly sophisticated molecular tools available to survey-confined built environments such as the ISS, exciting opportunities exist to survey the microbial populations of these environments and their potential impact on human health. Recent studies have begun to explore this built environment, but examination of the microbiome at a species-specific level, in combination with the functional capabilities of those species, has not been studied in depth.</p>
              <p id="Par47">The presented whole metagenome approach, combined with the application of the LMAT platform, allowed for species-specific identification. Further, the use of PMA treatment allowed for the selective detection of DNA sequence associated with viable microorganisms. Both of these factors are critical in determining whether the presence of a microorganism poses a risk to human health. Health-relevant microorganisms detected in PMA-treated ISS samples included a number of <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> species known to cause opportunistic and urinary tract infections, including <italic>C. aurimucosum</italic>, <italic>C. pseudogenitalium</italic>, and <italic>C. urealyticum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Opportunistic <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species were also identified, although at much lower abundance levels. Such species are known to cause invasive infections, though less commonly in immunocompetent individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Skin-associated species of <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> were prevalent in PMA-treated ISS dust samples, including <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. caprae</italic>, <italic>S. pettenkoferi</italic>, and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. These species are commonly associated with human flora and may cause opportunistic infections under certain circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>M. globosa</italic>, the causative agent of dandruff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], was observed at a high abundance in the ISS dust, again likely due to human contact. Higher incidence of <italic>Malassezia</italic> species associated with the skin of Japanese astronauts was recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The source of <italic>Malassezia</italic> species might be the skin of the crew; however, more in-depth analyses on skin samples of the crew and their inhabitable environments are warranted. In contrast to the human-associated pathogens noted above, <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> were more frequently observed in SAF samples. <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species are frequent offenders in hospital-acquired infections and are well adapted to propagation in environments subjected to frequent cleaning and disinfection such as cleanrooms and hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par48">Increased levels of human-associated bacteria in the ISS relative to the SAF may reflect constant human contact with ISS spaces, compared to the relatively controlled environment of the SAF cleanroom. Astronauts were required to clean their spacecraft with minimal resources once a week and when necessitated, whereas professional janitorial services were deployed to periodically clean SAF cleanrooms to maintain compliance with their cleanroom certification level. Additionally, increased prevalence of fungal species such as <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic>, <italic>Alternaria arborescens</italic>, <italic>A. pullulans</italic>, and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> in the SAF may be due to the relative austerity of this environment being more amenable to spore-forming fungi. Increased human-relevant microorganisms in ISS samples might be due to the crew inhabitants, as such observations were not made in the SAF dust. The observed increase in diversity in the SAF sample might be attributed to the exchange of air and soil from the outside environment, which does not occur in the ISS.</p>
              <p id="Par49">The above observations rely on a relative comparison of sequence abundance between microbial species and samples. It is therefore important to note that observed relative abundance levels can be affected by the applied amplification procedures. MDA was used prior to library preparation due to the low biomass limitations and highly precious samples associated with this study. While MDA may certainly impact relative abundance of amplified sequences relative to the original sample, the phi29 polymerase and methods used in this study have been shown to result in the lowest level of amplification bias relative to other available techniques. The potential for bias is similarly true for Nextera DNA library preparation, especially with respect to GC content bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which also includes a degree of sample amplification prior to sequencing. It is therefore important to note that, for the distinctions in relative abundance called out in this study, the actual quantity of precise fold change in abundance may differ somewhat from what was observed via the sequence data.</p>
              <p id="Par50">It should further be noted that selection by PMA treatment may not be uniform across every family of microbes. Spore-forming microorganisms, for instance, will react differentially to PMA exposure, as PMA may not sufficiently penetrate non-viable but intact spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Archaea are also indicated as demonstrating a distinct profile, though such organisms are anticipated to be extremely low abundant in these samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. While PMA treatment may impact observed abundance distinctions to a degree, this method creates a unique opportunity to enrich for viable microorganisms in a culture-free context and thus carries a value despite possible impact on capacity for quantitative assessment.</p>
              <p id="Par51">The detected fungi are not typically associated with human disease, though <italic>Alternaria</italic> are capable of causing invasive alternariosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and <italic>A. pullulans</italic> may cause complicating infections in patients undergoing chemotherapeutic regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, particularly the identified and previously cultured <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, are well known to exhibit virulence and cause disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Additional fungal content within ISS samples included the potential food spoilage agent <italic>Penicillium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], a notable observation as food spoilage is a relevant concern within the ISS. Overall, observation of sequence data mapping to the bacterial and fungal species above was in agreement with previous 16S rRNA iTag sequencing results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], indicating consistency of the whole metagenome data.</p>
              <p id="Par52">Although the majority of microbial species detected in this study cause mainly opportunistic infections, this does not mean their presence should be discounted with respect to astronaut health. It is known that microgravity, radiation, restricted diet, and limited hygiene practices can impact the immune systems of otherwise healthy individuals, altering cytokine and chemokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Microorganisms associated with opportunistic infections have been previously observed in the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and their presence could be a concern dependent on immune status of the exposed individual.</p>
              <p id="Par53">A factor critical to assessing risk of a given microbial population is evaluation of its genetic content, particularly with respect to antimicrobial resistance. This information cannot be obtained using 16S rRNA or ITS sequencing nor by predictive metabolic profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] as shown recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Important steps have been taken recently toward evaluating virulence factors in assembly facilities of terrestrial cleanrooms, finding that virulence components from a range of human pathogens exist in these spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Screening of our PMA-treated whole metagenome data for AMR revealed increased prevalence of genes encoding resistance factors in the ISS, particularly in dust samples, while the PMA-treated dust sample from the SAF contained few AMR-related genes. One possible explanation is that AMR factors may be more common in microbial populations with human contact, as they will encounter selective pressure from medical, environmental, and other treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. This has been demonstrated in previous studies of indoor environments, where human-introduced antimicrobial chemicals result in the elevated presence of AMR-associated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Though human traffic is more frequent and diverse in the SAF, it is also better controlled on Earth relative to the ISS. PMA treatment resulted in a reduction in detected AMR categories in the ISS filter, possibly indicating that while the total historical population exhibited AMR potential, the currently viable population contained fewer such signatures. This may be due to the reduced bacterial fitness associated with maintaining resistance in the absence of selective pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par54">It was observed that functional gene categories detected in the ISS dust were more likely to be associated with active growth and metabolism. This may be due to proximity of these samples with microbiomes of crew members, which may be better adapted to a metabolically robust life cycle. Importantly, functional genomic observations were made in PMA-treated samples, such that detected genes are likely derived from viable microorganisms and might impact human occupants.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Among the AMR gene categories uniquely identified by LMAT after screening against the CARD and VFDB, relatively higher numbers of reads were assigned to genes (&gt;100 reads) related to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily (ABCs), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, rRNA methyltransferase, methionine sulfoxide reductase (<italic>msr</italic>A), fluoroquinolone resistance (<italic>pat</italic>A and <italic>pat</italic>B), and clindamycin resistance (<italic>erm</italic>ABC) in the ISS dust (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). The ABCs genes, found in both ISS samples, have been reported to regulate the access of drugs to microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The MATE mutant strains in certain microorganisms exhibited increased sensitivity to the toxic organic cations acriflavine and methyl viologen, but not fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, berberine, or sodium deoxycholate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The rRNA methyltransferases (MTases), a large protein superfamily, commonly use <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine (SAM) as the methyl group donor. The SAM-dependent MTases methylate both nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) and proteins and thus modulate their activity, function, and folding. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, DNA and RNA metabolic microbial pathways were in higher abundance in ISS dust samples, which also exhibited more detected AMR gene categories. Methylation of nucleotides of 16S rRNA in aminoglycoside-producing microorganisms confers resistance to their own toxic product(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The methionine sulfoxide reductase gene (<italic>msr</italic>A) is involved in the oxidation of sulfur-containing residues and their regulation has emerged as a key mechanism of redox control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Methionine oxidation is a form of oxidative damage of proteins, a modification that alters protein structure or function, a tool in redox signaling, and a mechanism that controls protein function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Overexpression of the ABC transporter genes <italic>pat</italic>A and <italic>pat</italic>B confers efflux-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species and is also linked to stress responses and multidrug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Isolation of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was also reported from the ISS environmental samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were examined for inducible clindamycin resistance and the presence of erythromycin ribosome methylase (<italic>erm</italic>ABC) genes. Isolation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> from ISS dust samples and not from SAF samples was reported in this study, and the retrieval of clindamycin resistance genes from the ISS dust is in accordance with this observation.</p>
              <p id="Par56">Other genes uniquely identified by LMAT were related to transport protein <italic>qac</italic>B, multidrug efflux protein, lincosamide, and beta-lactamase resistance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The quaternary ammonium compound resistance gene (<italic>qac</italic>) also codes for resistance to a broad spectrum of other cationic compounds such as intercalating dyes, diamidines, and biguanides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species, several plasmid-encoded Qac efflux pumps have been described, belonging to two major protein families (QacA and QacB). The ISS utilizes mainly benzalkonium chloride wipes, a Qac compound as cleaning agents; hence, the presence of the <italic>qac</italic> genes is not surprising. The multidrug efflux systems play a major role in resistance to a wide range of noxious compounds in several Gram-negative species. It has been reported that the drug resistance and virulence phenotypes of <italic>Salmonella</italic> mutants defective either in resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type systems or in drug efflux systems belonging to the major facilitator, multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamilies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Lincosamide resistance was reported to harbor <italic>lsa</italic>C and <italic>tet</italic>W genes in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria might enter into the ISS via various sources (cargo, human occupants, etc.), where resistance genes can potentially spread and exchange between microbes. These include but are not limited to the sulfonamide resistance genes (<italic>sul</italic>1 and <italic>sul</italic>2), tetracycline resistance genes (<italic>tet</italic>M and <italic>tet</italic>C), and resistance genes for extended spectrum beta-lactams (<italic>bla</italic>
<sub>oxa-58</sub>, <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>shv-34</sub>, and <italic>bla</italic>
<sub>ctx-m-32</sub>). Furthermore, the presence of these genes in the cultivable population of ISS samples should be explored to confirm the presence of these genes via metagenome analysis.</p>
              <p id="Par57">As was previously noted, many of the virulence-associated genes identified in this study play a role in conferring AMR. A subset of these genes may also contribute to a virulence phenotype independent of resistance. Adenine methylase, for instance, has been shown to impact the expression of numerous genes regulating cellular activities relevant to virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], including cell invasion and protein secretion in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Bacterial elastases, also detected in the current study, have similarly been implicated in cellular invasion by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] through proteolytic activity at the site of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. A variety of genes encoding virulence-associated outer membrane proteins, such as genes encoding Lom-like proteins detected here, may enhance virulence by improving survival within host macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. rRNA methylases have been broadly implicated in virulence phenotypes across many bacterial species, including <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>], in addition to conferring resistance to aminoglycosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Expression of bacterial transposases may also broadly impact virulence through regulating gene expression, allowing for inter-bacterial transfer of mobile virulence elements and promoting in vivo adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Detection of the virulence-associated genes described here is highly relevant in the context of confined human habitation within the ISS, as these components will impact the ability of microorganisms such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> to effect particularly problematic and difficult-to-treat clinical manifestations in the crew through host cell invasion or other mechanisms. These factors should, therefore, be taken into account, though it should also be noted that such genes may also play general roles in other bacterial housekeeping functions under normal metabolic conditions.</p>
              <p id="Par58">The availability of gene content is a valuable resource for interpreting the functional capabilities of microorganisms in confined built environments. A challenge in interrogating these data is that assigning gene-level calls within whole metagenome data is inherently difficult given the depth required for high confidence assignment. Further efforts to identify the most salient functional gene categories, and application of targeted sequencing efforts toward characterizing these genes at great depth, may yield additional insight into the evolution and adaptation of microbial populations in such spaces. Ongoing studies are underway to assess space station and crew microbiomes over time during travel to and residence within the station, which may establish further connections between human health and function and dynamics of the microbial population that surrounds the human host in the ISS. Given the known impact of space travel and residence on immune function, this represents a critical piece of information and is the subject of great interest for future exploration.</p>
              <p id="Par59">The availability of sequence data corresponding to <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> across multiple samples raised the possibility that strain-level comparisons might be made across different locations. However, there was no coincident coverage corresponding to the assessed reference genomes across samples, making it difficult to identify sample-specific mutations. For example, at the genus level, LMAT classified approximately 25,000 and 71,000 reads as <italic>Bacillus</italic> in the pooled ISS and pooled SAF samples, respectively. These reads were mapped to <italic>Bacillus</italic> reference genomes through short read alignment. Despite the nearly three times as many SAF reads compared to ISS reads, a smaller proportion of SAF reads were mapped to <italic>Bacillus</italic> genomes at high quality. With respect to read counts, fewer SAF reads mapped at high quality than ISS reads. However, relaxing the mapping quality criteria reverses this relationship (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11A). These results are congruent with taxonomic binning with LMAT, where it was found that the majority of <italic>Bacillus</italic> reads associate with <italic>Bacillus ginsengihumi</italic>. As reported previously, <italic>B. ginsengihumi</italic> was isolated from ISS samples by standard culture techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par60">Since <italic>B. cereus</italic> sensu lato was previously isolated from the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], effort was taken to determine whether it could be observed in the current dataset. Our short-read alignment mapping of <italic>Bacillus</italic> reads in ISS samples supports classification by LMAT of <italic>B. cereus</italic> sensu lato at the species/strain level. Although few reference genomes were used in the alignment mapping, compared to the comprehensive LMAT database, a higher percentage of reads aligned to <italic>B. cereus</italic> sensu lato strains than non-<italic>B. cereus</italic> sensu lato strains. Of the bases mapped at high quality and depth, more variants were identified when using non-<italic>B. cereus</italic> sensu lato strains as references. These data point toward a variant most closely related to <italic>B. cereus</italic> sensu lato; however, sequencing at larger library sizes or higher depth to increase the probability of broader coverages would be required to assign taxonomy with greater confidence.</p>
              <p id="Par61">Breadth of reference coverage for <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> was uneven across samples. However, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> was sufficiently abundant on ISS to track a 5000-bp region common to ISS samples. It was possible to cluster samples via the Hamming distance between consensus sequences of fixed and nearly fixed positions and on non-reference allele frequencies for variant positions common to ISS samples, including those not near fixation. Samples clustered according to location when examining individual alleles, and according to PMA treatment status when comparing consensus sequences of fixed sites. These results suggest that fixed substitutions may separate viable samples from those that include non-viable sequences, while shared unfixed mutations, possibly from low-abundance competing strains, may separate the ISS filter from ISS dust environments. Future studies that more broadly cover the reference genome or pan-genome could confirm whether this relationship holds true.</p>
              <p id="Par62">The observed breadth of coverage for the species examined in this study may seem relatively low when compared to the absolute quantity of sequence data available. This was due in part to our application of a high threshold for depth of coverage (10×), which is important for declaring high-confidence base calls but filters out large portions of shallow coverage sequence. For <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Bacillus</italic>, on average, 36% of mapped reads passed the Snippy map quality threshold (mapping score ≥60) and 6% of high-quality bases passed the Snippy read depth threshold (≥10 reads). Additionally, in several cases, particularly for <italic>Bacillus</italic>, the strain inferred from metagenomic sequence data was sufficiently divergent from reference strains as to preclude mapping to a reference with high quality. If future studies are undertaken with the explicit goal of making strain-level comparisons, for example with MIDAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], panphlan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], or similar suites, consideration should be taken toward extensively over-sequencing such samples so as to increase the likelihood, not only for high coverage within a sample but also for high breadth of shared coverage across samples. This may not, however, improve reference coverage in the event that a highly divergent novel strain is under study.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p id="Par63">Metagenomic analysis of a controlled environment such as the ISS allows us to study the microbial composition of a unique circumstance where human habitation occurs during space travel. A whole metagenome approach permits for high taxonomic resolution and the ability to monitor changes in functional characteristics of microorganisms, which is not possible with amplicon sequencing. A comprehensive picture is necessary to guide less expensive, but focused assays. Such information will be crucial while planning for long-term exploration. Comprehensive sterilization is neither a viable nor desirable solution for such an endeavor; thus, it is critical to understand human co-inhabitance with the surrounding microbial community. Studies such as these may inform future approaches toward reducing the relative presence of pathogenic microbes and further understanding which microbiome compositions are amenable to healthy conditions for future space travelers. This is the first study to analyze antibiotic resistance and virulence genes from ISS whole metagenome sequence data. These data are important to assessment of the pathogenic potential of space habitats and may shed light on the use of countermeasures during future long-term space missions.</p>
