                <p id="Par1">Interest in space habitation has grown dramatically with planning underway for the first human transit to Mars. Despite a robust history of domestic and international spaceflight research, understanding behavioral adaptation to the space environment for extended durations is scant. Here we report the first detailed behavioral analysis of mice flown in the NASA Rodent Habitat on the International Space Station (ISS). Following 4-day transit from Earth to ISS, video images were acquired on orbit from 16- and 32-week-old female mice. Spaceflown mice engaged in a full range of species-typical behaviors. Physical activity was greater in younger flight mice as compared to identically-housed ground controls, and followed the circadian cycle. Within 9–11 days after launch, younger (but not older), mice began to exhibit distinctive circling or ‘race-tracking’ behavior that evolved into a coordinated group activity. Organized group circling behavior unique to spaceflight may represent stereotyped motor behavior, rewarding effects of physical exercise, or vestibular sensation produced via self-motion. Affording mice the opportunity to grab and run in the RH resembles physical activities that the crew participate in routinely. Our approach yields a useful analog for better understanding human responses to spaceflight, providing the opportunity to assess how physical movement influences responses to microgravity.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">In its 2011 report on the future of space exploration the National Research Council emphasized the importance of expanding NASA biosciences research to include long duration studies of rodents on orbit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Spaceflight involves exposure to microgravity, radiation, isolation, confinement, increased CO2, and other factors that may culminate in stress and pose potential health risks for astronauts. Exposure to microgravity is associated with numerous physiological and neural alterations, including cardiovascular deconditioning, bone and muscle loss, immune and metabolic alterations, visual/ophthalmic changes, sensorimotor disturbances during acclimation and re-adaptation to 1 g, and decreased post-flight tolerance to orthostatic challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The NRC recognized that that animal studies are needed to establish a deeper understanding of molecular, cellular, and organismal responses that can inform crew health during lengthy spaceflight missions. NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) responded to this charge by developing flight housing, operations, and science capabilities to support long duration rodent studies on the International Space Station (ISS).</p>
              <p id="Par3">Here we present a detailed behavioral analysis of mice living in space for extended durations (up to 37 days) as part of the NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR1) mission, the first deployment of the NASA Rodent Habitat on the ISS. Behavior comprises a remarkably well-integrated representation of the biology of the whole animal that informs overall neural and physiological status. Behavior not only ensures survival and reproductive success, it also provides a means by which the animal can control its environment to promote homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Behavioral analysis can reveal how animals acclimate to the space environment, and how altered physical activity, feeding, drinking, circadian shifts, social interactions may alter other experimental measures. Without knowing what an animal is doing in space, it can be difficult to interpret findings acquired from a single organ, tissue, cell type or signaling pathway.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Cage environment also exerts major effects on rodent physiology and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These concerns are magnified in the weightless space environment where an animal’s interactions with its habitat and conspecifics are dramatically altered compared to 1 g conditions. Physical activity, shaped by habitat configuration and complexity, can affect a broad range of physiological parameters - heart rate, respiration, oxygenation, and blood flow among others - that may in turn affect morphology, biochemistry, gene expression, or other physiological measures derived from body tissues.</p>
              <p id="Par5">NASA Space Shuttle experiments have shown that, in microgravity, animal habitat configuration can alter physical activity, thereby resulting in differential effects on muscle morphology. Singly-housed rats flown in the smooth-walled Research Animal Housing Facility (RAHF) floated freely. In contrast, group-housed rats flown in the more complex Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) were in continuous physical contact with one another and with the habitat walls, actively twisting and turning in a sort of “biokinetic jungle gym”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These results suggest that translating spaceflight research findings from model systems to humans involves distinguishing ‘direct’ effects of gravitational unloading on the body from ‘indirect’ effects due to behavioral alterations in weightless combined with animal habitat configuration. For all of these reasons, behavioral analysis of animals on-orbit is important for interpreting spaceflight data and ensuring translational relevance to human health in space.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Despite the obvious value of analyzing the behavior of model organisms <italic>on orbit</italic>, past spaceflight studies have typically flown animals in ‘black box’ environments that are ill-equipped to reveal what the animals are actually doing in-flight and how well they acclimate to living in space. Only a handful of reports have described the behavior of rodents during spaceflight. Two decades ago, adult, female (mid-pregnant) rats were flown five per NASA Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs) on the Space Shuttle mid-deck (STS-66 and 72) for 11 and 9 days, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Collectively, these reports are intriguing, but they demonstrate the paucity of rigorous behavioral analysis in studies of spaceflown rodents.</p>
              <p id="Par10">To gain greater insights into mouse behavior on orbit, we conducted a systematic and detailed analysis of species-typical behavior, physical activity, and circadian cyclicity in mice flown on the RR1 mission. RR1 was comprised of two distinct mouse cohorts: Validation mice were young (16-week at launch) female C57BL/6J mice flown by NASA to confirm biocompatibility of the RH during a long-duration (33-day) mission. Experimental mice were older (32-week at launch) female MuRF1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type (wt) littermates (C57BL/6NTac background) were on ISS for 17–18 days. Bone, muscle and other physiological responses were analyzed by the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research (NIBR) in collaboration with the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS). For each mouse cohort, ten mice were assigned assigned to Flight (FLT), identically-housed ground control (GC) or Vivarium (VIV) cage conditions. Video images were acquired from RH-housed FLT and GC mice only. Mice were housed in groups of five per each side of the bisected RH units (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There were two groups of Validation mice and one group each of MuRF1 KO and wt Experimental mice in the study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Rodent habitat (RH), camera views and field visibility.

              <p id="Par11">The RR1 video collections comprise an extensive and rich repository of images for analysis. However Video image acquisition was planned to conduct daily health checks, rather than detailed behavioral analysis. As a result, it was not possible to analyze behavior in the cage area adjacent to the water reservoir, there was limited tracking of individual mice due to the absence of visible mouse identifiers, and sample durations varied across mission days with no light cycle footage for much of the mission.</p>
              <p id="Par12">The Supplementary Video shows images of the mices’ behavior on orbit. Our major findings are: (1) FLT mice engaged in similar forms and levels of various species-typical behaviors as compared to GC mice, and (2) emergence of a unique circling or ‘race-tracking’ behavior within two weeks of launch in younger (but not older) mice. Circling swiftly metamorphosed into a coordinated group activity. Stereotyped motor behavior, rewarding effects of physical exercise, and vestibular sensation evoked via self-motion are considered as viable explanations for circling on orbit.</p>

We first determined whether the RR1 Video image resolution was sufficient for behavioral analysis by quantifying lens visibility in each of the bisected Validation and Experimental RH units across flight days for both flight and ground views (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c,d</xref>). Approximately two weeks into the flight, visibility of images captured from each of the four flight housing areas showed a significant but modest decline that persisted throughout the mission, reaching a maximum difference from L + 5 on the final video acquisition day. For Validation groups, final video acquisition day (L + 35) visibility was 85 and 67 percent for the left and right views, respectively. Experimental group visibility on the earlier final video acquisition day (L + 20) was 67 and 77 percent for the left and right views. Since these groups were flown in the same RH hardware, and the Experimental mice were twice the age of the Validation mice, the 32 percent greater biomass of the Experimental relative to Validation Flt mice (Pre-Launch body mass (g) Mean +/− SD, Experimental, 28.8 +/− 2.0; Validation, 19.5 +/− 1.1) likely accounts for the approximately two times more rapid decline to a lower final percent visibility relative to Validation mice. Collectively, this analysis reveals that the RH habitat design and Filter area video configuration provide excellent visibility and quality Video images that are amenable to highly detailed behavioral analysis for extended missions.</p>

                  <p id="Par16">Feeding and self-grooming were observed throughout the mission, with consistent levels of occurrence across microgravity and 1 g conditions. Drinking behavior could not be quantified due to water access in the Lixit area only. Hindlimb rearing, a characteristic species-typical exploratory behavior in rodents typically defined in terrestrial studies as lifting of the forebody from a quadrupedal stance against the gravity vector, was observed in control mice. Notably, spaceflight mice were observed to tether themselves to the habitat walls with their hindlimbs and/or tails, and extend their forebodies similar in form to hindlimb rearing.</p>
                  <p id="Par17">Some characteristic mouse behaviors may have occurred more commonly within the Lixit area, where they could not be readily quantified due to the limited camera FOV. Social interactions, both amicable (i.e., huddling, allo-grooming) and antagonistic (i.e. tail pulling, biting), all of which are common mouse behaviors, were observed infrequently in both flight and control conditions. These behaviors may also have occurred in the Lixit area that was approximately 20 percent smaller volume than the Filter area. This would afford more frequent opportunities for physical contact between conspecifics.</p>

Percent time spent ambulating and type of movement (quadrupedal, forelimb, or free-floating) were quantified from a single mouse for two minutes each day (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Feeding and self-grooming were not increased in either treatment group during the dark cycle. Hourly around-the-clock comparisons revealed a significant increase in the numbers of FLT mice in the Filter view during the dark cycle as compared to GC mice (p = 0.0009). FLT mice also spent significantly more time in the Filter area of the habitat during the dark as compared to light cycle (p = 0.011), whereas this metric did not achieve significance for GC mice (ns). As compared to GC mice, time spent ambulating was significantly elevated in FLT mice during the dark cycle (p = 0.05), and both FLT and GC mice were significantly more active during the dark as compared to light cycle (FLT, p = 0.01; GC, p = 0.04). This analysis indicates that the circadian timing system was intact during the last mission quarter. Total time FLT mice spend ambulating on L + 30 was more than double that of GC mice during the dark cycle.

                  <p id="Par23">Within 8–10 days post-launch (3–5 days post-ISS docking), the Validation FLT mice began to engage in a unique circling or ‘race-tracking’ behavior in which they moved their bodies along an ovular trajectory within the Filter area of the RH utilizing the habitat walls (See Supplemental Video). Circling emerged spontaneously, following an organized progression beginning with back-and-forth running by mice along habitat surfaces, and propelling themselves by pushing off of walls with hindlimbs. This behavior quickly evolved into full circular laps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Once mice began to navigate themselves in a complete lap within the habitat (L + 8 and 10 for the left and right sides of the habitat, respectively), the behavior progressed within 1–2 days to consecutive laps (Multi-Circling). Coordinated group circling (Group Multi-Circling) emerged 1–2 days later and involved multiple mice circling at the same time. The entire progression from individual single circles to group multi-circling behavior developed in both NASA Validation cohorts over just three days. Periodically across the flight, mice displayed backward flipping or “somersaulting” behavior similar to stereotypic mouse behavior described in terrestrial laboratories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Over time, the spaceflight mice began to move more quickly throughout the habitat, translating with ease through open spaces, but also anchoring their bodies using tails and/or paws. Anchoring allowed mice to feed, self-groom, huddle, and engage in social interactions. Mice remained active and mobile throughout the experiment, exploring their environment and occupying all areas of the habitat. The unique circling behavior emerged during the second mission quarter and progressed from a relatively solitary behavior to a highly coordinated group activity.</p>
              <p id="Par29">Here we report that spaceflight mice preferred the spacious Filter area over the smaller Lixit area of the habitat. This was evidenced by increased numbers of flight versus control animals in the Filter view beginning during the second mission week. With its larger expanse, the cage volume captured by the Filter camera provides greater opportunities for mobility relative to the Lixit area, and is therefore uniquely permissive for circling behavior. Further, circling emerged at the same time that mice increased their presence in the Filter area of the cage, raising the possibility that spaceflight mice developed a preference in flight for the larger cage area where circling could be performed. It is noteworthy that circling has been observed in at least one past shuttle mission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> utilizing the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), a precursor to the RH with considerable design overlap. This behavior has also been reported in mice flown on ISS in the RH on missions following RR1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Studies of mice flown in habitats other than the AEM or RH have not reported either circling or increased levels of physical activity or ambulation during spaceflight relative to 1 g controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This could be related to the design of the RH, that in contrast to some other habitats, is configured with multiple surfaces that mice can grab and utilize that may facilitate ambulation throughout the habitat. However there could be other explanations for the circling behavior. In the present study, circling by older Experimental mice was less than 1 percent of the numbers of circling laps observed in younger Validation mice. Age-related decline in physical activity in laboratory rodents, even across the range of young to middle-age, is well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and may have been a determinant of circling behavior in 16- but not 32-week-old mice reported here. This interpretation is supported by reports on subsequent RR flights of circling behavior in younger mice acquired from both Jackson Laboratories and Taconic Biosciences suggesting that age plays a role in the emergence of circling rather than strain differences. While additional experiments are clearly needed to ascertain the precise factors underlying mouse circling on orbit, here we consider several possible explanations.</p>
              <p id="Par31">Circling could represent the emergence of stereotyped motor behavior or abnormal repetitive behaviors (ARBs). Repetition comprises an important feature of normal behavioral functioning across animal phyla<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, however stereotypic behaviors are repetitive, unvarying, and apparently functionless behavior patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Stereotypies are generally thought to reflect impaired welfare as they tend to spontaneously appear in barren or restricted housing conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Common stereotypies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> that have been observed include pacing in birds, prosimians and large carnivores, crib- and bar-biting in horses, pigs and mice, vertical jumping in mice, rocking in primates, and self-injurious behaviors in parrots and primates.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Although less common in mice, “somersaulting”, “route-tracing”, and other forms of repetitive, unvarying and functionless locomotor have been observed<sup>3</sup>. Indeed, circling exhibited by Validation spaceflight mice shares some common characteristics with stereotypic behavior, viz., highly repetitive, somewhat invariant, with no obvious goal. In addition to the rapid, smooth circling trajectories, mice occasionally exhibited rapid back-flipping, not unlike somersaulting reported in the mouse husbandry literature. Free-fall is stressful and can activate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and stereotypies can be triggered or intensified by emotional stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, ground control mice housed in the RH did not exhibit somersaulting or any other identifiable motor behavior. This is similar to looping or somersaulting reported in tadpoles, fish and birds exposed to microgravity during parabolic or spaceflights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These observations indicate that mouse circling in flight was not due to a housing effect alone but raises the distinct possibility of an interactive influence of housing and weightlessness.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Environment enrichment is a biologically relevant resource or structuring of the cage that facilitates the occurrence of highly motivated natural behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. As such, enrichment can successfully reduce or prevent the occurrence of maladaptive behaviors such as ARBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and improves translation animal studies to humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. For mice, bedding is considered a highly effective form of environment enrichment that enables species-typical foraging and nest-building behaviors, and promotes warmth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. An animal is likely to be under a state of stress when its ability to perform natural, species-typical behaviors, such as foraging or nest-building, are prevented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study, the RH was not configured with environmental enrichment typical in terrestrial laboratories. However identically-housed ground controls did not exhibit analogous behavior, therefore a lack of enrichment and/or foraging opportunities alone does not support the interpretation of circling as a motor stereotypy. Microgravity was clearly a necessary condition for the emergence of circling. Notably, mice prefer a three-dimensional, complex cage structure that facilitates climbing and locomotion<sup>20</sup>. The ability of mice to utilize the full volume of the RH under microgravity conditions could, in and of itself, serve as an effective enrichment.</p>
              <p id="Par34">The mices’ circling behavior has some similarities to their use of running wheels in terrestrial studies. Wheel running is considered to be a paramount form of enrichment for rodents, one that occurs at far greater rates in barren cages as compared to enriched ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> or under stressful conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Mice given the opportunity to use a running wheel in the wild will do so with bout lengths comparable to captive mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> suggesting that running wheel activity in the laboratory setting is an elective behavior. It has been argued, however, that voluntary wheel running in the wild is not sufficient to preclude the possibility that wheel running in the laboratory itself represents a motor stereotypy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> with the potential to become compulsive and self-reinforcing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par35">Terrestrial laboratory animals housed in colony environments often experience environmental stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. It’s likely that hypergravity during launch, and microgravity (free-fall), weightlessness, increased airflow, low ambient temperature, increased CO2 and other environmental changes in space are stressful. Circling behavior in this study could have emerged as a stress response, however it would need to be argued spaceflight was uniquely stressful for the Validation mice that were younger in age and acquired from the Jackson Labs as compared to older Experimental mice acquired from Taconic Biosciences. Importantly, none of the Validation mice showed overt physiological signs of chronic stress or compromised health or welfare raising doubt that spaceflight mice circled due to stress.</p>
              <p id="Par36">For example, amounts of time spent feeding, and post-flight body weights were comparable in flight and ground control mice in both age groups. Antagonistic behaviors were observed at low levels in all study groups.

Circling behavior may relate to one or more potentially rewarding or anxiety-reducing changes in rodent brains. Future research comparing brain morphological, physiological and biochemical changes in mice that circle in space is warranted.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Microgravity exposure eliminates vestibular sensory input to the otolith organs (i.e. the utricle and saccule) that detect and respond to head static position and linear acceleration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The otoliths also contribute to the perception of verticality and spatial navigation in the neocortex and limbic system, including the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Changes in vestibular reflexive function and perception commonly occur during spaceflight Ground-based studies of rodents in which Bilateral Vestibular Labrynthectomy (BVL) is performed (sur- gical, chemical, or genetic lesions induced) report post-operative emergence of persistent motor abnormalities including hyperactivity, circling, and moderate ataxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The activity of forebrain dopamine systems was thought to play a central role in motor abnormalities following BVL, however the findings have been inconsistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and vestibular loss-related motor disorders cannot be solely explained by dopaminergic (DA) alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Interestingly, mice flown for 30-days on the Bion-M1 mission showed decreased expression of crucial genes involved in DA synthesis and degradation, as well as the D1 receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Other studies have focused on the orexin/hypocretin system implicated in central motor control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>, a role that is supported by findings that altering OXA expression may contribute to hyper-locomotion following an acute vestibular lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Anxiety-like responses have also been reported following BVL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that circling served as an anxiolytic to offset effects of otolith unloading.</p>
              <p id="Par40">Fish exposed to microgravity exhibit somersaulting and looping (swimming in tight circles) and spin- ning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. In a simple, but clever, experiment, Anken and colleagues analyzed Video images of fish looping behavior during a parabolic flight in relation to post-landing otolith weights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. The asymmetry in otolith weight was highly correlated with the direction and extent of the behavior looping. Thus microgravity reveals the natural asymmetry in neural structures that have been neutralized in gravity through adaptation.</p>
              <p id="Par41">An intriguing possibility is that, in the absence of gravitational input to the otoliths, circling behavior by the Validation spaceflight mice generated biologically-relevant amounts of vestibular sensory input. It has been hypothesized that stimulation of the vestibular system during self-motion could play a regulatory role in brain changes associated with physical activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The canals are functional in microgravity and presumed to be actively monitoring circling movements. It is reasonable to postulate that self-motion behaviors evoke vestibular stimulation in space.</p>
              <p id="Par42">The novel idea that natural, everyday activities generate measurable vestibular stimulation was recently examined in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> by recording mouse head movements using a lightweight module combining three linear accelerometers to measure linear accelerations, and three gyroscopes to measure angular accelerations during species-typical behaviors (e.g., walking, running, foraging, grooming, eating, climbing, etc). The intensity of the stimuli ranged from approximately 500 to 1300 deg s-1 angular velocity and 1–4.5 G linear acceleration providing evidence that the animals’ behavioral repertoire generates natural vestibular signals reaching the vestibular end organs. Thus it is feasible to suggest that self-motion could provide biologically-relevant amounts of stimulation to the vestibular end-organs during spaceflight. In the present study, we calculated from the RR1 in-flight Video images from L + 12 through L + 35 the average circling speed for the Validation mice. Assuming an ellipsoidal path around the habitat measuring an average of 27.2 inches in circumference, we estimated an average acceleration at a range of 1.16 m/s2 to 1.82 m/s2 (0.12 g-0.186 g). Vestibular self-stimulation poses a viable explanation for the circling behavior reported in this study. Spaceflight studies comparing mouse circling in different cage configurations (e.g., round vs oval) are needed to explain why mice are circling on orbit.</p>
              <p id="Par43">The behavioral analysis reported here provides a deeper understanding of how mammals acclimate to extended spaceflight, and sets the stage for identifying the physiological, cellular and molecular events driving mouse circling behavior in space. Stereotyped motor behavior, rewarding effects of physical exer- cise, and vestibular sensation produced via self-motion are controlled by distinct sensory-motor and brain areas for which specific, testable hypotheses can be generated. For example, signaling in stress pathways (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; HPAA) of circling mice would suggest classification of circling behavior as a motor stereotypy whereas reward centers (primarily the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop) would be involved if circling exerts a positive reinforcing effect. Vestibular self-stimulation would involve activity within the otolith organs and central nuclei of the balance system and may overlap with activation of stress and/or reward pathways. Behavioral research is vital for ensuring fidelity in translating rodent studies to human health concerns in space. Affording mice the opportunity to grab and run in the RH resembles physical activities that the crew participate in routinely. Our approach is yielding an interesting analogue for better understanding human responses to spaceflight, and providing the opportunity to begin to address how physical movement influences responses to microgravity.</p>

Food and water were available ad libitum. Mice were maintained in standard vivarium housing on a 12:12 hour dark/light cycle (lights on: 0600–1800 GMT). On L–12, mice were introduced to wire floors and regrouped into cohorts of 10. Mouse igloos were provided for enrichment from L-12 until loading into Transporters on L-1. On L-3 mice were assigned to Flight (FLT) or Ground Control (GC) conditions with groups matched for body weights. Mice assigned to a Vivarium (VIV) condition were not video-recorded thus not reported here. On L + 0 (Sept 21, 2014), ten Validation and ten Experimental FLT mice were launched on an unmanned Dragon Capsule (SpaceX4) from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to the International Space Station (ISS) in one Transporter mouse housing unit modeled after the original NASA Animal Enclosure Module (AEM). On L + 4, mice were transferred into Rodent Habitat (RH) units on the ISS fitted with dual access ports and housing areas (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The RH is an advancement of the AEM used to fly rodents on numerous successful short duration (18 days or less) missions during the 30-year Space Shuttle Era.

For this reason, schedule, frequency, and duration of video acquisition varied daily across the mission. Videography of both Validation and Experimental mice began on L + 5. Data were analyzed from daily surveillance videos until L + 35 for Validation mice, and until L + 20 for Experimental mice. The four-day delay in experimental operations for GC relative to FLT mice enabled precise temporal features of video acquisition to be applied asynchronously to corresponding groups of GC mice at KSC. Using images acquired from left and right Filter cameras and across both phases of the dark/light cycle, behavior was sampled daily from both Validation and Experimental FLT and GC mice. A total of 6 hr video footage was acquired from Validation FLT mice and 7 hr from Experimental FLT mice and their respective GCs. Timestamps were first matched to flight logs, adjusting for intermittent loss of signal. Sample durations were precisely matched across FLT and GC cohorts, but varied across Habitat side, cycle phase, days, or age (NASA and Experimental cohorts). Video segments available for analysis from the filter view ranged from 43 to 681 seconds (Mean +/− SE: Validation, 238 +/− 168 s; Experimental, 456 +/− 272 s). Video images were acquired beginning 15 minutes to 2 hours following the start of the each 12 hr light and dark cycles. For the NASA habitat, dark cycle video was acquired on each of their 33 flight days, but light cycle video was limited to L + 5 to L + 15. For the Experimental mice, dark cycle video was acquired on each of their 17 flight days (L + 5 to L + 21, excluding L + 8 for Filter Left) and light cycle video acquired on 10 days (L + 6 to L + 20, excluding 6 flight days).

Blind scoring was performed for Experimental wild-type and MuRF1 KO mice. Tracking individual mice within and across video segments was difficult due to the absence of visible identifying markers. For behaviors observed infrequently (feeding, grooming, rearing, and social interactions), multiple mice were coded within a given video segment and these group data were expressed as ratios of behavior duration relative to the number of mice scored and video duration on the corresponding day. In contrast, activity was observed at high levels, especially during the dark phase. Ambulatory behavior was therefore analyzed in single animals across 120 second video segments.</p>

Frame-by-frame analysis was then used to quantify time spent ambulating and the morphology of limb movements.</p>
