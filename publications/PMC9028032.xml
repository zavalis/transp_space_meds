              <abstract>
                <p>Human alpha herpesviruses herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) establish latency in various cranial nerve ganglia and often reactivate in response to stress-associated immune system dysregulation. Reactivation of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), VZV, HSV-1, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) is typically asymptomatic during spaceflight, though live/infectious virus has been recovered and the shedding rate increases with mission duration. The risk of clinical disease, therefore, may increase for astronauts assigned to extended missions (&gt;180 days). Here, we report, for the first time, a case of HSV-1 skin rash (dermatitis) occurring during long-duration spaceflight. The astronaut reported persistent dermatitis during flight, which was treated onboard with oral antihistamines and topical/oral steroids. No HSV-1 DNA was detected in 6-month pre-mission saliva samples, but on flight day 82, a saliva and rash swab both yielded 4.8 copies/ng DNA and 5.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/ng DNA, respectively. Post-mission saliva samples continued to have a high infectious HSV-1 load (1.67 × 10<sup>7</sup> copies/ng DNA). HSV-1 from both rash and saliva samples had 99.9% genotype homology. Additional physiological monitoring, including stress biomarkers (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and salivary amylase), immune markers (adaptive regulatory and inflammatory plasma cytokines), and biochemical profile markers, including vitamin/mineral status and bone metabolism, are also presented for this case. These data highlight an atypical presentation of HSV-1 during spaceflight and underscore the importance of viral screening during clinical evaluations of in-flight dermatitis to determine viral etiology and guide treatment.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Over the last two decades, our studies have shown that astronauts exhibit persistent immune system dysregulation due to stress and other unique features associated with spaceflight [<xref rid="B1-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Further, we have illustrated that multiple herpesviruses persistently reactivate in astronauts during space missions. This is evidenced by the shedding of viral DNA in body fluids, namely saliva, before, during, and after both short (up to 16 days) and long (≥180 days) duration space missions [<xref rid="B4-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. About 50% of astronauts reactivate and shed viral DNA for one or more of the nine known human herpesviruses during and after spaceflight [<xref rid="B6-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Four common herpes viruses that have been detected during space flight include Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Though the typical shedding of viral DNA is asymptomatic in most astronauts regardless of mission duration, live/infectious virus has been recovered in some cases. Whether crew develop symptoms or not, virus reactivation rates increase with spaceflight duration. This represents a significant health risk to crew assigned to extended missions to Mars and beyond.</p>
              <p>Stress depresses immunity, which contributes to latent herpesvirus reactivation. This correlation has been demonstrated in astronauts during space missions of variable durations over the last 20 years. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis during spaceflight results in increased levels of stress hormones, including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), epinephrine, and norepinephrine [<xref rid="B7-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Increases in these stress hormones, along with decreased cell-mediated immunity (as evidenced by decrements in cytotoxic T-cell function [<xref rid="B10-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Th1 &gt; Th2 cytokine shifts [<xref rid="B11-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), are contributing factors in the reactivation of latent herpes viruses in astronauts [<xref rid="B12-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p>Here, we report for the first-time detection of HSV-1 in saliva and in skin lesion samples. These samples were taken from an astronaut suffering persistent dermatitis lasting approximately 200 days during a long-duration spaceflight (≥180 days) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This astronaut reported rash onset at/around flight day 24 (FD24), with red, bumpy lesions appearing on the hands, arms, chest, back, and neck. The astronaut started antihistamines at that time, along with topical and oral hydrocortisone (fluocinonide 0.05% applied twice daily and fexofenadine HCl 180 mg daily). Twenty-nine days later, the astronaut developed a cold sore at FD53 that was subsequently treated with Valtrex (2000 mg PO q12h for 2 days). The astronaut continued to have rash along hands, arms, chest, back, and neck from which a lesion swab sample was collected at FD82. Finally, the astronaut was treated again for a cold sore with Valtrex on FD168. Interestingly, this astronaut had a previously documented history of atopic dermatitis [<xref rid="B13-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. While no lesion swab samples were collected during the previous mission, saliva samples taken in flight were positive for EBV and VZV. Immunologic, endocrine, biochemical, and viral sequencing data from this long-duration ISS spaceflight suggest a viral association to the symptoms observed in this astronaut.</p>

                <p>Saliva was collected in three different ways (rolled, passive, and dry) to evaluate very specific outcome variables. Rolled saliva was collected for five consecutive days at each of the eight time points to evaluate viral load, alpha amylase, cortisol, and DHEA.

                <p>To culture live virus, fresh saliva was collected by passive drool method one day after landing and processed immediately as follows: the sample was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in one milliliter of DMEM (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) media. The cells were then plated atop human lung fibroblasts (HFL), then the culture vessel was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min and then incubated at 37 °C with 5% humidified CO<sub>2</sub>. The cultures were observed daily for the formation of viral plaques, which were in turn confirmed by HSV-1-specific antibody staining.</p>

No significant increase in alpha amylase, a biomarker for assessing acute psychological stress in humans due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, was observed during flight as compared to pre-flight at any of the time points tested. However, when combining the pre-flight, during-flight, and post-flight sessions, post-flight alpha amylase levels (mean ± SEM 20.1 ± 1.89 U/mL) were significantly decreased compared to both pre-flight (mean ± SEM 38.4 ± 7.48 U/mL; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.046) and during flight (mean ± SEM 46.6 ± 6.95 U/mL; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.004).</p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a highly prevalent and communicable neurotropic alpha herpesvirus that establishes latency in cranial nerve ganglia. This virus persists lifelong as a latent virus and is commonly referred to as oral herpes. Reactivation of HSV-1 can be asymptomatic or can lead to lesions or skin rashes at sites corresponding to the infected innervating ganglion. The most typical presentation is characterized by an oral “cold sore” lesion. Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been reported in previous spaceflight studies, and it largely is an asymptomatic phenomenon. However, in some astronauts, herpesvirus reactivation may potentially lead to clinical diseases such as zoster and dermatitis. Here, we report for the first time, detection of HSV-1 both in saliva and in skin lesions of an astronaut during long-duration spaceflight. The astronaut evaluated had persistent dermatitis during flight, with atypical presentation but also cold sores, which were treated with a combination of antihistamines, topical and oral steroids, and Valtrex. No HSV-1 DNA was detected in the astronaut’s samples collected before flight at 180 and 45 days before launch. Samples collected during spaceflight were found to have a viral HSV-1 load by real-time PCR, with 4.8 copies/ng in a saliva sample and 5.3 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/ng in a lesion swab sample. The post-landing saliva samples yielded infectious HSV-1 with extremely high copy numbers (1.67 × 10<sup>7</sup> copy/ng DNA). This was confirmed by specific antibody staining as well as by PCR. HSV-1 genomes recovered from the in-flight skin lesion and post-orbit saliva were genotyped and found to have 99.9% homology.</p>
              <p>It is generally established that reductions in immunocompetence, including T-cell function, can result in loss of “control” of latent herpesviruses and thus allow their reactivation. Such immune suppression is also typically associated terrestrially with either stress or aging. However, astronauts who are typically very fit individuals in an extreme environment also experience latent herpesvirus reactivation associated with immune suppression. This phenomenon likely results from a synergy of stress, microgravity, radiation, and/or prolonged isolation. As observed in space missions with previous astronauts, this astronaut did show increases in several salivary markers of stress (<xref rid="viruses-14-00789-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) during flight compared to pre- and post-flight, confirming physiological stress changes within this extreme situation. Surprisingly, the current subject’s stress levels did not manifest the broad suppression in T-cell function observed in previous studies by the reduction in mitogen-stimulated cytokine production. However, a more atypical immune dysregulation did occur, as evidenced by the elevation in many plasma cytokines spanning the entire mission duration (<xref rid="viruses-14-00789-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We speculate that this astronaut subject retained immune cellular functions and stress hormone stability more so than the astronaut norm, yet the dysregulation and stress imbalance was still sufficient to manifest HSV-1 reactivation and shedding. Alternatively, the reactivation may be associated with loss of virus control by an alternate and unmonitored cellular mechanism such as angiotensin II discussed below.</p>
              <p>Our comparison of in-flight vs. post-flight HSV-1 genomes revealed that these viral genomes were nearly identical to one another (99.94%) at the consensus level. However, the in-flight HSV-1 genome had strikingly more minor variants (366) than the post-flight sample (24; see <xref rid="viruses-14-00789-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This numeric difference alone suggests that there are distinct environmental or clinical impacts on these viral populations during spaceflight. From an environmental perspective, the in-flight sample contains viral genomes that replicated in the presence of ionizing radiation, which may have impacted the rate of double-strand DNA breaks, recombination, and DNA repair, as well as impacts on the host DNA damage response [<xref rid="B36-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, we cannot untangle that possibility from other clinical distinctions between these samples, such as their different status of viral reactivation. For instance, an active lesion and ongoing rash during space flight may entail different viral and host responses than asymptomatic viral shedding in saliva after landing. There is also a potential difference in immune surveillance, such as inflammatory or immune cell-killing states, at the site of a skin lesion versus at salivary sites of asymptomatic viral shedding. Distinguishing between these possibilities will necessitate analysis of further in-orbit shedding samples, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, as well as additional comparisons of pre- and post-flight samples from future space travel.</p>
              <p>Nutritional status decreased during flight for some nutrients, particularly folate, vitamin B6, niacin, and vitamin C (see <xref rid="app1-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Total and LDL cholesterol increased as well as triglycerides. The increase in angiotensin II could have contributed to an inflammatory process that contributes to viral reactivation. Angiotensin II exerts an inflammatory effect on leukocytes and endothelial cells, contributing to reactive oxygen species formation, adhesion molecule, and chemokine release [<xref rid="B40-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Angiotensin II also modulates T-cell activation through autocrine actions from endogenous production. T cells can produce angiotensin II, which stimulates the production of superoxide, which promotes T cells to produce TNFα [<xref rid="B41-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the current subject, angiotensin II concentration was positively correlated with both TNFα and markers of oxidative damage (oxLDL and 8-hydroxy 2′-deoxyguanosine). Supportive of this, there is a higher prevalence of HSV-1 activation in patients with chronic kidney disease as an inflammatory stimulus where angiotensin II is high [<xref rid="B42-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
              <p>Regardless of the cause, this subject showed symptomatic in-flight HSV-1 viral reactivation and asymptomatic, continued shedding of infectious HSV-1 virus upon landing, which potentially could have transferred and caused clinical disease in crew contacts, including uninfected or immunocompromised individuals, as well as newborn infants. Specifically, infants exposed to HSV-1 are at increased risk for developing severe and life-threatening complications such as fatal organ damage (liver, lungs, and heart), as well as viral meningitis and sores on the face and eyes. Thus, it is essential to develop spaceflight countermeasures to prevent HSV-1 reactivations and ensure the health of the crew, as well as the health of their contacts upon return. One countermeasure that has proven efficacious is viral-specific therapeutic vaccines such as Zostavax against VZV reactivation. Our previous work on the reactivation of VZV in astronauts led to the implementation of Zostavax as a prophylactic countermeasure to herpes zoster. Since its implementation in 2013, very little VZV reactivation has been observed in crew samples. Interestingly, with the reduction in VZV reactivation, we have observed an increasing incidence of subclinical HSV-1 reactivation in crew samples. Historically, HSV-1 reactivation rates have been very low, but they now seem to be on the rise, suggesting a potential inverse correlational relationship with VZV reactivation. That may be true for the subject of this case study. In a previous long-duration mission, this astronaut had dermatitis and VZV and EBV shedding, although EBV would be an unlikely source of skin lesions. In the current study, this astronaut had dermatitis that has been directly linked to HSV-1 reactivation, and there was no evidence, in any of the biological samples, for VZV reactivation. No VZV vaccination was given between the missions. Unfortunately, at this time, no HSV-1 vaccine is available, but several therapeutic live-attenuated and subunit vaccines are in clinical or pre-clinical trials [<xref rid="B43-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another potential countermeasure against both HSV-1 and VZV, especially for individuals for whom vaccines are either ineffective or contraindicated, could be prophylactic administration of an antiviral drug (valacyclovir or Valtrex). Interestingly, the astronaut from this study was treated with Valtrex (2000 mg PO q12h for 2 days) during this mission (flight days 53 and 168) upon outbreak of cold sores, but it did not seem to be efficacious. Perhaps prophylactic pre-dosing and/or using a higher dose during outbreak could have reduced or eliminated the viral and symptom burden. To that end, we are currently studying the effectiveness of this prophylactic antiviral countermeasure to potentially prevent VZV and HSV-1 (as well as EBV) shedding in Antarctic expeditioners, who have similar patterns of viral DNA shedding in saliva as astronauts. These and other countermeasures (i.e., specific resistive and aerobic exercise, nutritional supplementation, and stress relieving exercise) must continually be evaluated and updated to ensure the health and safety of our astronauts in space and their contacts upon return.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>These data confirm that in some cases, the viral reactivation, stress imbalance, and immune dysregulation experienced by astronauts during spaceflight is not entirely a subclinical phenomenon and may indeed be associated with clinical processes requiring treatment. For this case, dermatological lesions present during space flight and immediately after returning to Earth coincided with elevated stress markers, circulating inflammatory cytokines, and HSV-1 DNA shedding in saliva and lesion swab. HSV-1 genomes recovered from in-flight skin lesions and post-orbit saliva were deep-sequenced and found to be nearly identical at the consensus genome level. However, the in-flight rash sample contained a far more diverse population of viral genomes than the post-orbit saliva sample. The reasons for this are not known but may include differences in immune activation state, exposure to ionizing radiation in space, or lesion vs. asymptomatic shedding. Astronaut saliva contains increasingly significant viral DNA, which can be infectious during and after spaceflight. For that reason, and in response to the data from the current astronaut subject indicating that the persistent skin rash may have a viral etiology, we recommend prophylactic (vaccine and/or antiviral) treatment, where available, to the astronauts before they go into space as a countermeasure. Further, a broader package of countermeasures to reduce viral reactivation and restore immune function should be considered for the upcoming “Artemis” deep space missions.</p>

The two astronaut-derived HSV-1 genomes (orange) clustered nearest to HSV-1 genomes from China (CR-38) and Russia (L2). This graph-based SplitsTree network was generated from an alignment of the astronaut-derived HSV-1 genomes with 51 HSV-1 genomes that encompass the global genetic diversity of this virus. The Φ statistical test in SplitsTree4 found statistically significant evidence for recombination (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0), as expected based on prior analyses of HSV-1 phylogenies. The overall geographical origins of the prior HSV-1 genomes are European and North American (red); European, North American, Asian (blue), and African (green). The scale bar represents 0.1% nucleotide divergence. <xref rid="app1-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S1</xref> includes the names, accessions, and geographic origins of each strain.</p>

This included (<bold>a</bold>) 366 MVs in the in-flight rash vs. (<bold>b</bold>) 24 in the post-flight saliva HSV-1 samples. Minor variants (MVs) are plotted based on their location within the HSV-1 genome (x-axis) and the frequency of the detected MV allele (y-axis) at each position. Minor variants are color-coded according to their classification as missense (genic), synonymous (genic), or intergenic/other. A black line and arrowhead (right of each plot) indicate the MV detection threshold of 2% (0.02). A diagram of HSV-1 coding sequences is located below each x-axis to highlight the coding sequences that contain missense minor variants. <xref rid="app1-viruses-14-00789" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S3</xref> includes the precise location, coverage depth (i.e., forward and reverse reads supporting the major vs. the minor allele), and a list of specific MV impacts within each gene.</p>
