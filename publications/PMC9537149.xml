                <p id="Par1">Neuro-ocular changes during long-duration space flight are known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). The ability to detect, monitor, and prevent SANS is a priority of current space medicine research efforts. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement has been used both terrestrially and in microgravity as a proxy for measurements of elevated intracranial pressure. ONSD shows promise as a potential method of identifying and quantitating neuro-ocular changes during space flight. This review examines 13 studies measuring ONSD and its relationship to microgravity exposure or ground-based analogs, including head-down tilt, dry immersion, or animal models. The goal of this correspondence is to describe heterogeneity in the use of ONSD in the current SANS literature and make recommendations to reduce heterogeneity in future studies through standardization of imaging modalities, measurement techniques, and other aspects of study design.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Up to 60% of astronauts exposed to microgravity during long-duration space flight (LDSF) develop some degree of neuro-ocular changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These findings include optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds, hyperopic shifts in refraction, and optic nerve sheath distension. Together, these findings in astronauts have been termed “spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome” (SANS). Although the specific etiology of SANS is unclear, possible etiologies include a cephalad fluid shift in microgravity that may cause chronically elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral venous congestion, lymphatic dysfunction, compartmentalization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the optic nerve sheath, disturbances in the one-carbon metabolic pathway, increased CO<sub>2</sub> exposure, or a combination of these mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Normal visual function is vital for mission performance and safety. Therefore, SANS is a crucial NASA research priority to further understand and prevent visual compromise during LDSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. A portable, reliable, non-invasive measurement tool for evaluating the magnitude of optic nerve sheath expansion in SANS remains an area of need.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been proven to reliably detect elevated ICP in terrestrial clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In multiple meta-analyses and systemic reviews, increased ONSD has been found to be a highly sensitive (ranging from 90% to 93%) and moderately specific (ranging from 74% to 85%) metric for detecting elevated ICP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, with an overall mean ONSD difference of 1.3 mm (95% CI 0.6–1.9 mm) between elevated and normal ICP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. ONSD ultrasonography (US) is portable and non-invasive, making it ideal for use in evaluating unstable patients, in low resource settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and during space flight where a spectrum of ocular US measurements has been performed for years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is also a part of the routine terrestrial pre- and post-space flight surveillance in astronauts, and while not portable, it remains a valuable tool to further our understanding of SANS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Despite ONSD measurement’s potential benefits in detecting elevated ICP terrestrially and monitoring SANS manifestation during space flight, ONSD utilization is limited by variability in measurement technique and positive test cutoff values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This variability highlights a need for standardization of ONSD measurement, technical specifications, and study design both for terrestrial and spaceflight use.</p>
              <p id="Par4">This article provides a focused qualitative review and discussion of ONSD use in current aerospace medicine literature from both ISS astronaut and ground-based analog studies, critically evaluates these studies, and attempts to uncover the current limitations of ONSD measurements in SANS-related research. Using this methodology, we intend to highlight shortcomings in current ONSD research and provide practical guidelines to standardize and improve the utility of ONSD measurement for the evaluation of SANS.</p>

                <title>Review methodology and overview</title>
                <p id="Par5">We assessed the current methods and measurement quality of ONSD in the literature by searching PubMed and Google Scholar for the following keywords: “optic nerve”, “optic nerve sheath”, “optic nerve sheath diameter”, “ocular”, “space flight associated neuro-ocular syndrome”, “visual impairment due to intracranial pressure”, “space flight”, and “microgravity”. Search terms were combined in a Boolean search format. Additional articles were identified by ancestry from relevant articles. Included manuscripts were limited to those that measured ONSD related to microgravity exposure or ground-based microgravity analogs; possessed qualitative or quantitative descriptions of the ONSD; were fully accessible peer-reviewed papers; and were published in English. The review was focused on experimental design, image acquisition, qualitative evaluation of published sample images, and summarizing the main ONSD-related results. Close attention was given to ONSD image acquisition, measurement, validation, and interpretation. These terms were defined as follows: image acquisition; obtaining ONSD images using US or MRI including the technical specifications and imaging conditions, measurement; accurately placing calipers on the image to obtain an ONSD measurement, validation; independent confirmation of the measurement by multiple experts, and interpretation; using ONSD measurements to interpret underlying pathology or physiology.</p>
                <p id="Par6">This review examined 13 studies that measured ONSD for the evaluation of the effects of microgravity or its analogs.

                <p id="Par7">There is no established consensus on ONSD image quality criteria. Suggested US ONSD quality criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> were modified to focus on the qualitative evaluation of published images as follows: (i) anatomic differentiation; good contrast between the posterior sclera, optic nerve, periorbital CSF, optic nerve sheath, and retrobulbar fat. (ii) Meningeal boundaries; clearly visible subarachnoid space, meningeal boundaries, and retrobulbar fat. (iii) Optic nerve head view; an ideal view represents the thinnest retinal–vitreous interface without the interposition of the thick sclera. (iv) Measurement depth; measurement should be performed at 3 mm posterior to the vitreous–retinal interface. (v) ONSD measurement; correct ONSD measurement is performed at the boundary of subarachnoid space and dura. These criteria were used for the evaluation of published sample US and MRI ONSD images, when available.

                <p id="Par9">Mader et al. in 2011 reported optic nerve sheath (ONS) distention in 6 of 7 astronauts that underwent MRI imaging following LDSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Notably, ONS distension was mostly asymmetric in 3 of the 6 astronauts. In 2021, Mader et al. followed 3 of the astronauts from the original 2011 case series who had persistent globe flattening for 7 years or more following LDSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In 2017, Mader et al. described another astronaut with asymmetric optic disk swelling and increased ONSD in both eyes after LDSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Strengths: all three studies had images with good anatomic differentiation, meningeal boundaries, and optic nerve head views. Weaknesses: not reporting ONSD measurement or measurement depth. Quantitative ONSD measurements were not reported in the 2011 and 2017 publications, and in only one subject in the 2021 publication, limiting the ability to compare these findings to more recent literature.</p>
                <p id="Par10">The Mader et al. 2013 case study of an astronaut with two LDSFs (6 months each, 9 years apart) provided measurements of the ONSD taken by both MRI and US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. All recorded measurements were for the second flight, and MRI measurements were taken 9 months pre-flight as well as 6 days post-flight, while the US was done 11 and 6 months pre-flight; 1, 3, and 5 months inflight; and 3 days post-flight. The first flight occurred prior to the implementation of in-flight ocular ultrasound monitoring and images are not available for comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Strengths: the study provided quantitative measurement of the ONSD that demonstrated an increase in US ONSD from baseline MRI and US ONSD which persisted 3–6 days post-flight on both US and MRI; the MRI images from this study met all quality criteria with good anatomic differentiation, meningeal boundaries, optic nerve head views, measurement depth and accurate placement of ONSD measurement markings; the US images demonstrated good anatomic differentiation, meningeal boundaries, optic nerve head views, and accurate placement of ONSD measurement markings. Weaknesses: this study did not specify the measurement depth on ultrasound images.</p>
                <p id="Par11">Kramer et al. in 2012 retrospectively reviewed MRI studies of 27 astronauts after LDSF. Eight of these astronauts had MRI studies done before and after an additional spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Strengths: the MRI images from this study met all quality criteria with good anatomic differentiation, meningeal boundaries, optic nerve head views, measurement depth, and accurate placement of ONSD measurement markings; ONSD of the right and left eyes were measured independently at three depths (3, 4, and 5 mm from the vitreoretinal interface); the measurements were done by two experienced radiologists and repeated by one reader, demonstrating high inter- and intra- observer reliability. No weaknesses were identified. This study showed that astronauts with ONS kinking or globe flattening had larger ONSD measurements, but no significant association was found between the number of spaceflights and ONSD.</p>
                <p id="Par12">Rohr et al. used MRI combined with semi-automated image analysis to assess ocular changes in 10 astronauts with prior microgravity exposure who underwent additional missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. MRI studies performed preflight and at 5 timepoints post-flight, extending as far as 1 year, were reported. The authors manually marked the optic nerve head, then used automated image analysis to analyze the boundary contours of a coronal ONS slice 3 mm posterior to the optic nerve head to assess the optic nerve sheath cross-sectional area. Strengths of this study included MRI images with good anatomic differentiation, clear meningeal boundaries, and optimal ONH view; measurement depth of 3 mm from the ONH; and accurately marking of the meningeal boundaries for the ONS area. Weaknesses: lack of manual measurements to validate the automated technique; ONSD was reported in one table and measurement methods were not specified; and the measurement depth and ONSD were not marked on an axial image to allow for qualitative evaluation.</p>
                <p id="Par13">Sirek et al. used US to study ONSD and central retinal artery blood flow before, during, and after microgravity exposure in astronauts and compared these changes with those found in microgravity-naïve healthy volunteers subjected to 20 min of head-down tilt (HDT) at 6° and 30°<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Strengths: US images demonstrated good anatomic differentiation, meningeal boundaries, and ONH view; ONSD measurement depth of 3 mm from the vitreoretinal interface on the inner dural margin. Weaknesses: lack of markers on the sample US image to allow qualitative evaluation; ONSD was averaged bilaterally, which may mask ONSD changes given ONSD asymmetry in SANS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; and using mean differences rather than actual means which limits the interpretation of findings in the context of other literature.</p>

                <p id="Par14">Kondrashova et al. measured changes in ONSD using the US before, during, and after a 3-min inversion in the Trendelenburg position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These measurements were performed by medical students under the supervision of a physician experienced in ultrasound. Strength: accurate ONSD depth markers placement at the vitreoretinal interface. Weaknesses included lack of clear anatomic differentiation, clear meningeal boundaries, or a consistently clear view of the ONH, as one of the published images, showed a thick scleral band obstructing the ONH; the ONSD markers appear inaccurate given the poor anatomic differentiation; the study reported combined eye ONSD findings rather than report each eye independently; the authors did not specify the HDT angle, which is important to report as steeper angles cause a higher ONSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>; the unblinded nature of the study combined with unclear meningeal boundaries may have contributed to errors through expectancy bias and measurement errors favoring artificially larger measurements after HDT.</p>

Strength: analysis of ultrasound images by at least two sonographers. Weaknesses: lack of details on ultrasound technique and no sample images were published to verify the quality of measurements.</p>
                <p id="Par16">Marshall-Goebel et al. performed an HDT + CO<sub>2</sub> study that evaluated a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) device as a potential SANS countermeasure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Orbital MRI was used to evaluate ONSD changes after 5 h of different levels of HDT (−6°, −12°, and −18°), −12° HDT with 1% inhaled CO<sub>2</sub>, and −12° HDT while wearing a −20 mmHg LBNP device as a potential countermeasure to cephalic fluid shift. Strengths: MRI images demonstrated good anatomic differentiation, clear meningeal boundaries, and optimal ONH view; measurements were performed at the correct depth and checked for accuracy by an additional expert observer; and ONSD measurements were performed bilaterally. Weaknesses: right and left eye ONSD measurements were averaged together; vague depth reference structure “behind the eye globe”; and no depth or ONSD markings were annotated on the sample image, preventing qualitative evaluation of measurement technique.</p>
                <p id="Par17">Kermorgant et al. used dry immersion to simulate weightlessness in healthy volunteers for 3 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Subjects were placed supine in a thermoneutral water bath, with a layer of fabric separating the subject from the fluid to simulate the weightlessness and cephalad fluid shift that occurs in microgravity. ONSD was measured at baseline before the study, on days 1 and 3 of dry immersion, and 1 day after dry immersion. Strengths: ONSD depth measurement at 3 mm from the vitreoretinal interface; two views (transverse and sagittal plane) were taken for each eye; each measurement was validated by an expert observer, and the expert performing the measurements was blinded to the experimental conditions, which increases the internal validity of the study findings. Weaknesses: lack of published sample images for qualitative evaluation and the vague depth reference structure “behind the eye globe”; and averaging ONSD measurements bilaterally.</p>

                <p id="Par18">Hamilton et al. investigated the relationship between ICP and ONSD in a porcine animal study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. While measuring ONSD at the 3–5 mm depth via ultrasound, saline was infused into the brain parenchyma to artificially increase ICP and identified a positive and direct relationship between ICP and ONSD. IV saline bolus was used to increase central venous pressure (CVP) in one animal. There was a clear relationship between ICP and CVP, but there was a lack of a relationship between ONSD and CVP. Strengths: ONSD images demonstrated good anatomic differentiation, clear meningeal boundaries, and optimal ONH view; appropriate depth and ONSD marker placement; and eye measurements were reported independently. The weakness of this paper was the use of a curvilinear US probe on some of the images used, rather than the linear probe typically used for ONSD measurements.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Nusbaum et al. further studied the effect of cerebral venous congestion on ICP and ONSD in an animal model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Using juvenile porcine subjects, superior vena cava balloon catheters were inflated to induce restricted cerebral venous outflow. Changes in internal vena cava pressure, external vena cava pressure, ICP, and ONSD were monitored. The group with restricted cerebral venous flow had a significant increase in CVP, ICP, and ONSD compared to the placebo. Strengths: images demonstrated good anatomic differentiation, meningeal boundaries, and ONH views. Weaknesses: lack of depth measurement markers, and no clear description of the depth reference structure; the ONSD measurements incorrectly included the hypoechoic dura in the measurement for the venous congestion image but not the normal image, raising concerns that the experimental group had artificially higher ONSD values; the study reported that the measurements were performed in the coronal and sagittal views while the sample image shows an axial view; and ONSD measurements were performed at the 2 mm depth, which is different from the standard 3 mm depth used in humans.</p>

                <p id="Par22">ONSD can be evaluated with MRI or US, and each modality has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantages of MRI are lower vulnerability to user error for image acquisition, excellent soft tissue contrast, visualization of the entire optic nerve, and the ability to utilize automated quantification and three-dimensional reconstructions. MRI use is limited by high cost, lack of portability, and current inability to perform during spaceflight. In contrast, US ONSD measurement is a highly portable, inexpensive, and dynamic methodology that can be conducted quickly at virtually any location. This versatility comes with the limitation of needing an expert operator to obtain high-quality images and perform the measurements. Astronauts on the ISS have successfully performed the ocular US with remote guidance and have obtained good quality US images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. While MRI and US measurements of the same subject at the same time point showed excellent consistency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, it is not possible to use this data from different SANS ONSD studies interchangeably due to the variability in timing and measurement methods. MRI and ultrasound are used at different time points to measure ONSD primarily due to logistical considerations. The inability to use MRI to measure ONSD during spaceflight limits the utility of MRI studies since ONSD changes rapidly as demonstrated by head-down tilt studies, which measured significant changes after 3 min–5 h of HDT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and while undergoing lumbar puncture in terrestrial settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This rapid change in ONSD diameter may lead to underestimation of ONSD changes as it may have returned to its preflight value before the opportunity for postflight measurement. Therefore, the only changes that would be detected by MRI postflight would be those where the extent of distension caused long-term structural changes in the ONS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> which may persist for years after LDSF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. This behavior, known as hysteresis, occurs when ONSD reversibility may be impaired after episodes of prolonged high pressures within the ONS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, it may be useful to use both MRI and US at baseline to verify consistency between modalities.</p>
                <p id="Par23">Issues that may limit ONSD image acquisition and measurement in SANS studies included lack of sample images in publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> to confirm image quality, lack of annotation of measurements on sample images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> to verify measurement of correct structures, unclear measurement depth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or using non-standard depth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, sample images lacking anatomic differentiation (contrast) needed to accurately measure ONSD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, using a curvilinear ultrasound probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> as opposed to the standard of using a linear probe, and inclusion of the dura in ONSD measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> as opposed to the measurement at the interface between the SAS and dura. These findings, limitations, and proposed solutions are discussed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par24">Challenges that limited ONSD reporting and interpretation in SANS studies included combining left and right eye measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or not specifying whether the measurements were combined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, reporting differences in mean in ONSD measurements without reporting actual pre-, in-, and post-flight means<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, limited experience in ONSD measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and lack of blinding potentially leading to overestimation of ONSD measurement in the experimental group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These findings, limitations, and proposed solutions are discussed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p>
                <p id="Par25">Inflight US ONSD measurements are performed routinely in many astronauts for SANS surveillance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, inflight ONSD findings are published in only 18 astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This publication gap limits the development of future research projects that better utilize US ONSD for the inflight evaluation of SANS, and publishing this data should be a research priority.</p>
                <p id="Par26">An additional gap in knowledge that limits the interpretation of ONSD in the evaluation of SANS is the lack of a clear cutoff to distinguish “normal” from “pathologic”. In the terrestrial setting, the cutoff used to detect elevated ICP has also varied between trials in the range of 5.0–6.4 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These studies are not only limited by the large range but also cannot directly carry over to SANS, which is a different pathologic process with no direct evidence of ICP elevation in astronauts. While the currently published data on astronauts and ONSD is limited in quality and quantity, available spaceflight data suggests that ONSD increases with spaceflight, which warrants further research. Further study is also needed to establish the ONSD change that is appropriate for the detection of SANS. This gap in knowledge can be partially explained by the small sample size of astronauts with ONSD measurements available for study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It should be noted that while the clinical and imaging characteristics of SANS have been empirically described and revised periodically, there is no gold standard test for assessment of increased ONSD in SANS. Also, a certain degree of ONS distension could be protective for astronauts during spaceflight, allowing for greater levels of elasticity during cephalic fluid shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, questions remain unanswered regarding how much ONSD chang<strike>e</strike> one should expect during spaceflight, and what amount of ONSD increase can be considered pathological. Concurrent examination of optic disc edema in individual astronauts may help determine pathological thresholds of ONS expansion. Optic disc edema can be evaluated using techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography and fundus photography, both of which are done on ISS astronauts in-flight. The correlation of venous congestion and US internal jugular vein cross-sectional area might also be useful, as this is also an ISS astronaut's in-flight capability.</p>

                <p id="Par29">US ONSD image acquisition should utilize a high-frequency (commonly 12–14 MHz) linear array probe with ocular settings if available. For safety, excessive globe pressure should be avoided and a thermal index (TI) ≤ 1.0 and mechanical index (MI) ≤ 0.23 should be utilized. The subject should maintain a neutral gaze to avoid ONS deformation with lateral gaze and stay in a supine position unless the study specifically aims to study the effects of different body positions on ONSD. Lateral axial view is recommended as a minimum. If other views are obtained, they should be obtained in addition to this standard view.</p>
                <p id="Par30">US images should demonstrate good sonographic differentiation where the subarachnoid space can be clearly differentiated from surrounding structures and include a view of the ONH without a thick scleral band interposing between the retina and the optic nerve. Measurement should be performed at the 3 mm depth from the vitreoretinal interface, perpendicular to the nerve axis, and at the inner diameter of the dural sheath, the interface between the hypoechoic dural sheath and hyperechoic CSF in the SAS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par31">MRI measurement of ONSD can provide clearly defined margins between the high signal intensity vitreous fluid and CSF in the SAS, and the much lower signal intensity sclera and optic nerve sheath on fluid-sensitive T2-weighted sequences. MRI ONSD image acquisition parameters that could improve the accuracy of OSND measurements using this property of MRI are as follows: (i) maximize T2-weighted contrast between fluid and soft tissue structures using echo-times at 100 ms or greater. (ii) Acquisition of isotropic voxel size of 0.8 mm or less using a 3D T2-weighted sequence to minimize partial volume artifacts and increase edge detection of structures. Isotropic voxels also allow optimal orthogonal reconstruction of the optic nerve sheath relative to the optic disc improving cross-sectional measurement of the OSND. (iii) Image acquisition at 3 T or greater field strength with 32-channel or greater head coil to improve signal-to-noise of the small voxel size acquisition. (iv) Minimize chemical shift artifact which can blur margins of the optic nerve sheath from adjacent orbital fatty tissue using a fat suppression technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.
