                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">As the interest in manned spaceflight increases, so does the requirement to understand the transcriptomic mechanisms that underlay the detrimental physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity. While microgravity-induced differential gene expression (DGE) has been extensively investigated, the contribution of differential alternative splicing (DAS) to the plasticity and functional status of the skeletal muscle transcriptome has not been studied in an animal model. Therefore, by evaluating both DGE and DAS across spaceflight, we set out to provide the first comprehensive characterization of the transcriptomic landscape of skeletal muscle during exposure to microgravity.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and morphological analyses were conducted utilizing total RNA and tissue sections isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles of 30-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to microgravity or ground control conditions for 9 weeks.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3">In response to microgravity, the skeletal muscle transcriptome was remodeled via both DGE and DAS. Importantly, while DGE showed variable gene network enrichment, DAS was enriched in structural and functional gene networks of skeletal muscle, resulting in the expression of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms that have been associated with the physiological changes to skeletal muscle in microgravity, including muscle atrophy and altered fiber type function. Finally, RNA-binding proteins, which are required for regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, were themselves differentially spliced but not differentially expressed, an upstream event that is speculated to account for the downstream splicing changes identified in target skeletal muscle genes.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Our work serves as the first investigation of coordinate changes in DGE and DAS in large limb muscles across spaceflight. It opens up a new opportunity to understand (i) the molecular mechanisms by which splice variants of skeletal muscle genes regulate the physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity and (ii) how small molecule splicing regulator therapies might thwart muscle atrophy and alterations to fiber type function during prolonged spaceflight.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par43">With the rapidly expanding scientific and commercial interests in space exploration, an increase in long-term human ventures into space is inevitable but not without risk. Even before man entered this new frontier in 1961, astronomers and clinicians alike cautioned that “it will not be engineering problems but rather the limits of the human frame that will make the final decision as to whether manned spaceflight will eventually become and remain a reality” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, biomedical researchers have worked tirelessly to keep pace with breakthroughs in aerospace engineering over the last half-century by characterizing the impact of spaceflight on the human body and studying interventions to mitigate the adverse influence of sustained weightlessness.</p>
              <p id="Par44">For example, prolonged disuse of skeletal muscle, often referred to as mechanical unloading, precipitates muscle atrophy in microgravity environments, characterized by a loss of muscle mass and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Similar microgravity-associated muscle phenotypes have been identified in the limb muscles of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] exposed to microgravity as well as sedentary human populations such as the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and handicapped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While countermeasures, chief among them being regular exercise, are beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], these interventions fail to completely prevent microgravity-induced atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ultimately, after only 1 month of exposure to microgravity, skeletal muscle can decrease up to 20% in mass and 30% in strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This loss of mass and strength prevents astronauts from performing mission tasks and puts them at increased risk of injury upon return to higher gravity conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par45">While aggressive muscle conditioning and rehabilitation on Earth can eventually restore muscle mass and strength, this process can take anywhere from a few months to 4 years, with muscle type-specific differences in rehabilitation time attributed to compositional and functional distinctions between different muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Compositionally, skeletal muscle is defined by its myosin heavy chain (MyHC) expression pattern, with slow-twitch muscles predominantly expressing MyHC I isoforms and fast-twitch muscles predominantly expressing MyHC II isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Functionally, skeletal muscle is defined by its role in controlling movement. Most microgravity research has focused on skeletal muscles that control sagittal plane movements, including flexion (bending of a joint) and extension (straightening of a joint) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The gastrocnemius and the quadriceps are the muscles of the mouse hind limb studied here. The gastrocnemius expresses both MyHC I and MyHC II isoforms and functions as an ankle extensor and knee flexor, while the quadriceps predominantly expresses the MyHC II isoform and functions as a knee extensor and hip flexor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par46">The composition and function of skeletal muscle dictates the nature and extent of its response to microgravity. For example, extended spaceflight induces more atrophy in slow-twitch fibers than in fast-twitch fibers and more in primary extensors than in primary flexors, with the atrophic response beginning in the largest fibers within a muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although muscle atrophy is the most prominent physiological adaptation of skeletal muscle to microgravity, skeletal muscles are also subject to muscle type-specific fiber type alterations. As is implied in their nomenclature, fast-twitch fibers are responsible for dynamic movement while slow-twitch fibers support low-level, sustained activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, reliance on the dynamic component of motor function in microgravity necessitates an adaptive increase in fast-twitch fiber content at the expense of existing slow-twitch fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par47">The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has spurred extensive interest in elucidating the transcriptomic underpinnings of microgravity-induced phenotypes. Most interest has been paid to the transcriptomic effects at the level of differential gene expression (DGE). Recent transcriptome analyses of skeletal muscle in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have annotated microgravity-induced DGE of gene networks related to contractile machinery, calcium homeostasis, muscle development, cellular metabolism, inflammatory/oxidative stress response, and mitochondrial function. One landmark study, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Twins Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], identified DGE between monozygotic twins that were exposed to spaceflight or ground control conditions for one year. While this study occurred in the context of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and FACS-sorted immune cells, some transcriptomic changes persisted up to 6 months after return to Earth, suggesting that transcriptome remodeling due to spaceflight is not entirely transient.</p>
              <p id="Par48">However, a focus restricted to the level of DGE fails to account for the actions of alternative splicing (AS) on the host’s transcriptome. RNA-binding protein (RBP)-mediated AS accounts for the multi-fold increase in the diversity of translatable mRNA isoforms over what can be accounted for by the approximately 30,000 genes in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In fact, approximately 95% of human genes have been found to exhibit alternatively spliced isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], most attributable to the best characterized and most prevalent AS types: skipped exon (SE) and mutually exclusive exon (MXE) events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The role of AS in skeletal muscle on Earth has been well-annotated, including regulation of myogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], cell type-specific function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], fiber-type-specific function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], muscle contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], calcium handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, there have been no investigations of differential alternative splicing (DAS) in skeletal muscle during or following spaceflight. In fact, there has been only a single examination of microgravity-induced DAS, and that study focused on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a species of flowering plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par49">Here, we set out to characterize, for the first time in an animal model, diversification of the skeletal muscle transcriptome by DAS in microgravity. Total RNA and tissue sections were isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles of 30-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to either microgravity or ground control conditions for a total of 9 weeks. Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), immunohistochemistry, and morphological analyses, we aimed to characterize functionally significant DAS changes in non-differentially expressed skeletal muscle genes that describe a previously uninvestigated means of modifying the transcriptome in response to the physiologic demands of microgravity.</p>

                <p id="Par50">Twenty 30-week-old female BALB/c mice (Taconic Biosciences, NY) were used in this study. These animals were opportunistically obtained from a study originally designed to analyze changes in bone following microgravity exposure and test a novel therapeutic for osteoporosis. In the study presented here, only animals that received control therapy (subcutaneous phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections every two weeks over the total 9 weeks of experimentation) were used. The age, gender, and strain of our mice were chosen based on the design of the osteoporosis study. In regard to age, 30 weeks is around the timepoint at which mouse hind limb bone mineral density (BMD) reaches its peak and stabilizes until its eventual decline around the age of two years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Therefore, any changes in BMD observed after 9 weeks of spaceflight could be definitively attributed to the effects of microgravity rather than developmental and/or aging processes. In regard to sex, female mice are often favored over male mice in osteoporosis research as ovariectomy is the best-established, most clinically relevant model of postmenopausal osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Finally, regarding strain, BALB/c mice are a common model for osteoporosis therapy testing because BALB/c females respond optimally to ovariectomy and hypogonadism compared to other strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and BALB/c males demonstrate more prevalent glucocorticoid-induced secondary osteoporosis than C57BL/6 males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p>

                <title>Muscle atrophy is associated with microgravity-induced DAS of both the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and transcripts encoding giant sarcomeric proteins</title>
                <p id="Par68">Protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a major cause of acute muscle atrophy, which represents muscle loss that occurs within approximately 48 h of an atrophy-inducing perturbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Acute activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been shown to be directed by DGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]; however, a recent study in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] discovered DAS of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway transcripts after 7 days of hindlimb unloading. Following 9 weeks of microgravity exposure, we observed DAS, but not DGE, of transcripts encoding ubiquitin-proteasome pathway proteins in both the gastrocnemius (two DAS events; see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and the quadriceps (four DAS events; see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Importantly, we identified potential gain-of-function splicing events within <italic>Ubap1</italic> and <italic>Usp14</italic> that serve as examples of possible chronic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway activation by DAS.</p>
                <p id="Par69"><italic>Ubap1</italic>, which encodes ubiquitin-associated protein 1, undergoes DAS via mutual exclusion of exons 4 and 5 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Of most importance is the inclusion or exclusion of exon 5, which encodes a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain required for interaction of Ubap1 with ubiquitin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The exon 4-excluded, exon 5-included transcript isoform encodes a functionally intact, UBA1-retained protein product while the exon 4-included, exon 5-excluded transcript isoform encodes a partially dysfunctional, UBA1-removed protein product (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). In the gastrocnemius of spaceflown mice, exon 4 was 27% less abundant following 9 weeks of microgravity exposure (FDR &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C), resulting in a reciprocal increase in exon 5 abundance. Therefore, the exon 4-excluded, exon 5-included, functionally intact, UBA1-retained protein product is likely expressed to a greater degree in spaceflight in the gastrocnemius. There was no significant difference in exon 4 or 5 inclusion across flight and ground control groups of the quadriceps (4%, FDR &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>DAS of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway genes during spaceflight. <bold>A</bold> Bars and dashed lines represent exons and introns, respectively, of <italic>Ubap1</italic> pre-mRNA, with exon numbering below.

Exon 4 encodes the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain required for Usp14’s activation of ubiquitinated proteins and stimulation of the proteasome’s degradative capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Therefore, the exon 3-excluded, exon 4-included transcript isoform encodes a functionally intact, UBL-retained protein product while the exon 3-included, exon 4-excluded transcript isoform encodes a partially dysfunctional, UBL-removed protein product (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>E). While there was no significant difference in exon 4 inclusion across flight and ground control groups of the gastrocnemius (5.1%, FDR &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F), exon 4 was 13% more abundant in the quadriceps of spaceflown mice as compared to ground controls (FDR &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>F) at the reciprocal expense of exon 3.

                <p id="Par71">While AS events within a single transcript are often discussed in isolation of one another, numerous AS events may act concomitantly to impact the structure and function of long mRNA transcripts. In the context of skeletal muscle, concomitant AS of transcripts encoding the three giant sarcomeric proteins (<italic>Ttn</italic>, <italic>Obscn</italic>, and <italic>Neb</italic>) can invoke significant alternations to the size of the resulting protein products (titin, obscurin, and nebulin). Non-differentially expressed, <italic>Ttn</italic>, <italic>Obscn</italic>, and <italic>Neb</italic> were all differentially spliced following 9 weeks of spaceflight in both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. Specifically, we observed significant alterations in the length of transcript regions encoding important functional domains that have been associated with muscle atrophy.</p>
                <p id="Par72">Titin, which is encoded by the gene <italic>Ttn</italic>, is a 3900-kDa protein that regulates the elasticity and contractile strength of the sarcomere via the length of its PEVK domain, named for its high proportion of Pro-Glu-Val-Lys amino acids. Often referred to as a “molecular spring”, lengthening of the PEVK domain has been associated with the development of muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. While there is a relatively equal distribution of positive and negative △PSI values (average △PSI across statistically significant events = − 2.0%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B) across the 10 significant DAS events within the PEVK domain-encoding region in the gastrocnemius (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A), the majority of the 33 significant DAS events within the PEVK domain-encoding region in the quadriceps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A) exhibited a positive △PSI value (average △PSI across statistically significant events = 8.1%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>C). The concomitant inclusion of alternatively spliced exons in the quadriceps is expected to lengthen titin’s PEVK domain during prolonged spaceflight in myofibers composing the quadriceps. This spaceflight-induced extension of the PEVK domain may contribute to the development of atrophy in the quadriceps, while a lack of extensive spaceflight-induced alterations to the PEVK domain in the gastrocnemius is expected considering its relatively lower level of atrophy as compared to the quadriceps in this study.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>DAS of transcripts encoding giant sarcomeric proteins during spaceflight. <bold>A</bold>

                <p id="Par73">Obscurin, encoded by the gene <italic>Obscn</italic>, is an 800 kD protein that is integral to myofibril organization during assembly. DAS of the <italic>Obscn</italic> splicing variability region (SVR, exons 40–53) has been associated with muscle atrophy in rat models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Specifically, exon inclusion within the SVR precipitates atrophic phenotypes. While the precise regulatory mechanism underlying the effect of DAS on <italic>Obscn</italic> during atrophy is yet to be fully elucidated, it is speculated that the inclusion of exons within the “GGGG”-rich SVR leads to the development of cytotoxic secondary RNA structures called G-quadruplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In the gastrocnemius of mice exposed to microgravity for 9 weeks, there was evidence of one exon within the <italic>Obscn</italic> SVR that was included to a significantly higher degree in microgravity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, E); however, in the quadriceps of mice exposed to microgravity for 9 weeks, we identified three exons within the <italic>Obscn</italic> SVR that were included to a significantly higher degree in microgravity compared to ground controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>D, F). This is similar in magnitude to the four-exon inclusion identified in the atrophic rat model employed by Qiu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Exon inclusion within the <italic>Obscn</italic> SVR during prolonged spaceflight is expected to increase the prevalence of cytotoxic G-quadruplexes in myofibers composing both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps, which may be contributing to the development of atrophy in both muscles, albeit to a lesser degree in the gastrocnemius than in the quadriceps in this study.</p>
                <p id="Par74">Nebulin is a 600–900-kD protein encoded by the gene <italic>Neb</italic> that determines thin filament length. In contrast to titin, shortening of nebulin has been associated with the development of muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps of mice exposed to microgravity for 9 weeks, there was DAS (eight and seven significant DAS events, respectively) within the 3′ region of the <italic>Neb</italic> transcript; involved 3′ exons encode the actin, tropomyosin, and desmin binding regions of nebulin (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>G). The average statistically significant △PSI values across all DAS events were − 16.1% and − 6.1% in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>H, I). The concomitant exclusion of alternatively spliced exons in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps during prolonged spaceflight is expected to shorten nebulin’s C-terminal variable region in myofibers composing both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps. This spaceflight-induced shortening of nebulin may contribute to the development of atrophy in both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps.</p>

                <title>DGE is associated with reduction of slow-twitch fiber content while DAS is associated with potentially expanded fast-twitch fiber function</title>
                <p id="Par75">Reliance on the dynamic component of motor function in microgravity necessitated an adaptive shift towards a greater overall fast-twitch fiber phenotype in the hindlimb muscles of mice exposed to microgravity for 9 weeks. The gastrocnemius, which expressed both slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers prior to spaceflight, underwent a fiber type transition in which fast-twitch fiber content increased significantly at the expense of native slow-twitch fibers (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). By comparison, the quadriceps maintained its 100% fast-twitch dominance (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Considering the gastrocnemius underwent a fiber type transition while the quadriceps exhibited fiber type maintenance following 9 weeks of microgravity exposure, we investigated whether these differences in the microgravity-induced fiber type alterations of the gastrocnemius and quadriceps were accompanied by differences in DGE and DAS of fiber type-related genes during spaceflight in these two muscles.</p>
                <p id="Par76">First, we found that all differentially expressed fiber type-related genes in the gastrocnemius (<italic>Actn2</italic>, <italic>Myl12a</italic>, <italic>Myl2</italic>, <italic>Myl3</italic>, <italic>Myom3</italic>, <italic>Myoz2</italic>, <italic>Tnnc1</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic>; see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) encoded slow-twitch-specific proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and all such transcripts were downregulated following extended spaceflight. By contrast, in the quadriceps of mice exposed to microgravity there were no differentially expressed fiber type-related genes (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Therefore, the diminished slow-twitch fiber content in the gastrocnemius that is not observed in the quadriceps may be explained by the downregulation of slow twitch-specific transcripts in the gastrocnemius but not the quadriceps.</p>
                <p id="Par77">While no fiber type-related genes were differentially expressed in the quadriceps during prolonged exposure to microgravity, there were five fiber type-related genes (<italic>Tnnt1</italic>, <italic>Mybpc1</italic>, <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Neb</italic>, and <italic>Ryr1</italic>; see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) that underwent potentially protein structure-altering DAS events, three of which (<italic>Neb</italic>, <italic>Ryr1</italic>, and <italic>Tnnt3</italic>; see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were also observed in the gastrocnemius of mice exposed to microgravity.

Specifically, exon 5-included <italic>Tnnt1</italic> and exon 3-excluded <italic>Mybpc1</italic> transcripts have been abundantly observed in fast-twitch muscle fibers. In the case of <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, inclusion or exclusion of exon 5 alters the three-dimensional structure of Tnnt and subsequently influences the calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensitivity of the troponin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The predicted superior Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the exon 5-included compared to the exon 5-excluded Tnnt isoform contributes to the preferential inclusion of exon 5 in <italic>Tnnt1</italic> transcripts within fast-twitch muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

Specifically, exon 16 and exon 17 of <italic>Tnnt3</italic> vary in their sequence similarity to the functionally equivalent exon in <italic>Tnnt1</italic>; exon 17 shows a much higher degree of similarity (61%) than exon 16 (32%) (Wang and Jin, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]). As a consequence, the binding affinity of Tnnt for its functional partners (troponin I and tropomyosin) is variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]; the affinity of the exon 17-included Tnnt isoform is higher for the slow-twitch isoforms of troponin I and tropomyosin, whereas the affinity of the exon 16-included Tnnt isoform is higher for the fast-twitch isoforms of troponin I and tropomyosin (Wang and Jin, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]).

Specifically, basic isoforms, which exclude exons 4, 8, and F, tend to invoke a greater Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity to contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], contributing to their preferential utilization in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In the gastrocnemius, while there was no significant DAS of exon 4 (− 2.7%, FDR &gt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E), there was significant exclusion of exons 8 (− 11.9%, FDR &lt; 0.001, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F) and F (− 5.3%, FDR &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G). Exons 4 (− 8.3%, FDR &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>E) and 8 (− 7.3%, FDR &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F) were significantly excluded in the quadriceps, while exon F was not significantly alternatively spliced (− 3.0%, FDR &gt; 0.05, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>G). Although exhibiting partially distinct splicing patterns in the gastrocnemius and quadriceps, both muscle types displayed evidence of DAS within the 5′ variable region of <italic>Tnnt3</italic> that would promote the expression of basic residue-enriched protein isoforms, presumably to cope with the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> demand in fast-twitch fibers during prolonged spaceflight. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that DAS of <italic>Ryr1</italic> may contribute to the function of fast-twitch muscles. Specifically, the human homolog of <italic>Ryr1</italic> exon 70 (<italic>RYR1</italic> exon 70) is known to be preferentially included in the spliced mRNA of fast-twitch muscles and reciprocally excluded in slow-twitch muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. While the mechanism that contributes to increased use of this isoform in fast-twitch muscles remains unknown, the microgravity-induced inclusion of exon 70 in <italic>Ryr1</italic> in both the gastrocnemius (8.8%, FDR &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>H) and quadriceps (9.3%, FDR &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>H) can be taken as further evidence of the possible splicing-supported expansion of fast-twitch fiber function during prolonged spaceflight in both muscle types.</p>

                <title>DAS of musculoskeletal splicing regulators may account for downstream splicing changes in spaceflight</title>
                <p id="Par81">DAS is under the regulatory control of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), with DGE of these RBPs thought to invoke downstream changes in DAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, despite identifying numerous spaceflight-induced DAS events, there was no evidence of spaceflight-induced DGE of RBPs (see Additional files <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Surprisingly, we found evidence of potentially protein structure-altering DAS of RBPs themselves; in the gastrocnemius, there were four significant DAS events in four RBP-encoding transcripts as compared to eight significant DAS events in eight RBP-encoding transcripts in the quadriceps (see Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Of specific interest are <italic>Mbnl1</italic> and <italic>Rbfox1</italic>, because of reports that Mbnl1 directs splicing of <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Ttn</italic>, and <italic>Ryr1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and Rbfox1 directs splicing of <italic>Mybpc1</italic> and <italic>Ryr1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par82">Mbnl1 is an RBP with two tandem <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNA-binding domains [zinc finger (ZF)1-2 tandem and ZF3-4 tandem] that bind <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory elements in mRNA targets, including <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, <italic>Ttn</italic>, and <italic>Ryr1</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>D), and direct splicing of nearby transcript regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. <italic>Mbnl1</italic> undergoes DAS of exon 2 with the generation of two isoforms, each with a different translational start codon (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). In the exon 2-included transcript isoform, the start codon resides in exon 2 and the final protein isoform contains both tandem RNA-binding domains (ZF1-2 and ZF3-4). However, in the exon 2-excluded transcript isoform, the start codon resides in exon 3 and the final protein isoform contains only one of two tandem RNA-binding domains (ZF3-4, Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B). The ZF1-2 and ZF3-4-containing protein isoform exhibits more activity and target RNA motif specificity than the protein isoform containing ZF3-4 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In the gastrocnemius of spaceflown mice, there was no significant change in exon 2 inclusion (− 3.0%, FDR &gt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C), but in the quadriceps of mice exposed to microgravity, the exon 2-included transcript isoform, which encodes both the ZF1-2 and ZF 3-4 tandem domains, is 13% less abundant (FDR &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>C). So, while the activity and binding specificity of Mbnl1 likely remains intact in the gastrocnemius of spaceflown mice, Mbnl1 is expected to be expressed in a functionally impaired form in the quadriceps of mice exposed to microgravity.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>DAS of musculoskeletal splicing regulators during spaceflight. <bold>A</bold> Bars and dashed lines represent exons and introns, respectively, of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> pre-mRNA with exon numbering below.

                <p id="Par83">The aberrant splicing of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> in the quadriceps is speculated to account for some of the splicing changes we identified in its downstream targets. For example, Mbnl1 has been motif mapped to the PEVK domain-encoding region of <italic>Ttn</italic> and exon 5 of <italic>Tnnt1</italic>. Homozygous knockout of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> results in increased inclusion of <italic>Ttn</italic> PEVK-encoding exons and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> exon 5, suggesting that Mbnl1 acts canonically to promote skipping of these exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This is consistent with our annotation of increased inclusion of <italic>Ttn</italic> PEVK-encoding exons (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> exon 5 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) in the spaceflown quadriceps, which increasingly expresses the exon 2-excluded, potentially dysfunctional protein-encoding transcript isoform of <italic>Mbnl1</italic>. In addition, the lack of DAS of <italic>Ttn</italic> PEVK-encoding exons (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> exon 5 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) in the spaceflown gastrocnemius is consistent with the expression of the exon 2-included, functional protein-encoding <italic>Mbnl1</italic> transcript isoform in this muscle. This proposed mechanism of physiologically significant DAS of skeletal muscle target genes via upstream splicing of RBP transcripts is outlined in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> using Mbnl1and its downstream targets, <italic>Ttn</italic> and <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, as an example.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of physiological significant DAS of skeletal muscle genes via upstream splicing of RBPs. RBP splicing, downstream target splicing, and potential functional impact are highlighted here. Splicing patterns in ground and spaceflight are differentiated by blue and tan/orange boxes, respectively. Dotted lines represent directionality of proposed processes with corresponding text annotations. Solid lines represent RBP binding and splicing regulation with inhibition of such depicted by a red “X”. DAS of exon 2 of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> determines the translational start site (TSS) of <italic>Mbnl1</italic> mRNA and generates two distinct Mbnl1 RBP isoforms (ground, functionally intact; spaceflight, functionally impaired). While the functionally intact Mbnl1 isoform in ground binds freely to motif mapped regions of <italic>Ttn</italic> (PEVK domain-encoding exons) and <italic>Tnnt1</italic> (exon 5), the functionally impaired Mbnl1 in spaceflight exhibits less activity and target RNA motif specificity, directing splicing away from the canonical splicing pathway (<italic>Ttn</italic>, concomitant exclusion of PEVK domain-encoding exons; <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, exon 5 exclusion) and towards an aberrant splicing pathway (<italic>Ttn</italic>, concomitant inclusion of PEVK domain-encoding exons; <italic>Tnnt1</italic>, exon 5 inclusion) that has been associated with the physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to spaceflight, such as expanded fast-twitch fiber function and muscle atrophy</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13395_2022_294_Fig9_HTML" id="MO12"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par84">In addition, Rbfox1 is an RBP that acts as a splicing regulator in both muscle and brain tissue, with the tissue-specific function of this protein being regulated by DAS involving B40 (the brain-specific exon consisting of 40 base pairs) and M43 (the muscle-specific exon consisting of 43 base pairs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>E, F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. In muscle, Rbfox1 is known to regulate splicing of <italic>Mybpc1</italic> and <italic>Ryr1</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. While the B40/M43 DAS event has previously been annotated as a mutually exclusive event, we observed significantly increased inclusion of B40 in both the gastrocnemius (8.1%; FDR &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G) and quadriceps (8.9%; FDR &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>G), albeit without a reciprocal significant exclusion of M43 in either muscle. The preferential inclusion of B40 in <italic>Rbfox1</italic> transcripts in both the quadriceps and gastrocnemius may result in increasingly impaired binding of this RBP to its pre-mRNA targets in both muscles.</p>
                <p id="Par85">Similar to <italic>Mbnl1</italic>, the aberrant splicing of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> may account for some of the splicing changes we identified in its downstream targets. For example, Rbfox1 has been motif mapped to exon 3 of <italic>Mybpc1</italic>. Homozygous knockout of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> results in increased exclusion of <italic>Mybpc1</italic> exon 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. This is consistent with our annotation of significant exon 3 exclusion in the quadriceps, which undergoes splicing of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> to potentially functionally inhibitory isoforms. Despite potentially inhibitory splicing of <italic>Rbfox1</italic> in the gastrocnemius, we did not identify DAS of <italic>Mybpc1</italic> at exon 3 in this muscle, possibly due to the smaller magnitude of B40 inclusion in the gastrocnemius as compared to the quadriceps.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par86">We set out to characterize the role of DAS in the transcriptomic response of mouse hind limb muscles to microgravity; however, the work presented here has also provided novel insights more broadly into the reciprocal relationship between DGE and DAS. Co-transcriptional splicing was first documented as long as 30 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>], and since then, the molecular mechanisms underlying the coupling of DGE and DAS have been elucidated, including regulation of splicing by transcriptional elongation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and modulation of splicing factor recruitment by nucleosome positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] and histone modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In addition, more recent research has characterized a direct physical connection between RNA polymerase II and the spliceosome at the point of emergence of pre-mRNA from the transcriptional machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Together, this evidence suggests that these distinct mechanisms of transcriptome regulation (transcription and splicing) are intricately related. While it is believed that this intricate relationship is regulated by tissue-specific regulatory factors, DGE and DAS have either been investigated together in a single biological system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] or separately across multiple biological systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Therefore, there have been no comprehensive investigations of DGE and DAS together across multiple biological systems until now. Our results showed that the transcriptomes of the gastrocnemius and quadriceps were biased towards adaptation via DGE and DAS, respectively, after 9 weeks of microgravity exposure (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This observation is the first evidence of a possible reciprocal, muscle type-specific relationship between DGE and DAS, such that each muscle preferentially employs one mechanism of transcriptome regulation at the other mechanism’s expense.</p>
              <p id="Par87">We hypothesize that the muscle type-specific regulatory biases we identified are indicative of differences in energy availability across each muscle. While it has been proposed that energy availability influences patterns of transcriptome regulation, only recently has it been shown that patterns of both DGE and DAS vary across high and low energy environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>] as a result of diminished supply of mitochondrial adenine nucleotides in atrophic skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Potentially diminished adenine nucleotide supply in the more atrophied quadriceps may direct the use of DAS, a less energy-dependent mode of transcriptome regulation, over DGE, a more energy-dependent mode of transcriptome regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. By contrast, potentially adequate supply of adenine nucleotides in the less atrophied gastrocnemius may favor DGE over DAS. To examine this possibility, further studies of microgravity-induced muscle atrophy should compare adenine nucleotide levels across various skeletal muscle types.</p>
              <p id="Par88">Regardless of the mechanism of transcriptome regulation that was preferentially employed in each muscle during prolonged spaceflight, we found that transcripts encoding proteins with known functions in skeletal muscle were primarily alternatively spliced rather than differentially expressed in both the gastrocnemius and quadriceps after 9 weeks of microgravity exposure (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, while we identified regulation of mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism via DGE (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), as has been described previously in skeletal muscle following spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we characterized DAS as a novel means of modifying the transcriptome in response to microgravity. Further, we identified coordinate changes in splicing and microgravity-induced physiological adaptations of hind limb muscle, which included muscle atrophy (see Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and potential expansion of fast-twitch function (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Finally, in the absence of significant DGE of RBPs in either of the hind limb muscles studied here following microgravity exposure for 9 weeks, we discovered potentially functionally significant, spaceflight-induced DAS of RBPs themselves (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), an upstream provocation that may account for downstream splicing changes we identified in skeletal muscle transcript targets. Together, these findings represent the first parallel observations of splice variants and physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity. These findings are supported by the extensive body of cited literature from models of microgravity as well as non-microgravity contexts that either annotated similar splicing-phenotype associations or established causative splicing-phenotype relationships by perturbing isoform-specific expression and characterizing downstream changes in muscle physiology. Ultimately, our work adds to the growing body of research demonstrating the power and potential of alternative splicing to affect skeletal muscle physiology and creates a resource for future mechanistic investigations of alternatively spliced skeletal muscle gene products and physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity.</p>
              <p id="Par89">Beyond the associative, not necessarily causative nature of our work, we are also aware of four limitations of our study related to its design, including the age, gender, and strain of the mice employed and the timeline of our experimentation. First, previous characterizations of the musculoskeletal adaptation to spaceflight have occurred in mice ranging from 8-20 weeks old at the time of spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], requiring inquiry as to the role age (our experiments employed mice that were 30 weeks old at the beginning of experimentation) may have played in generating the muscle phenotypes we observed and the transcriptomic alterations we characterized. Although our mice are relatively older than those employed in previous microgravity investigations, the physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle we identified are consistent with those characterized previously in younger mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. This is expected considering that sarcopenia typically does not present until at least two years of age in mice living in normal gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. More important to our work is the relationship between modes of transcriptome regulation and age. While relative employment of DGE and DAS fluctuates with age and organismal development, most of this fluctuation in mice occurs immediately preceding and immediately following birth (until approximately post-natal day 28) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. In addition, there is evidence in both mice and humans to suggest relative stability of the skeletal muscle transcriptome across adult years and even into later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Therefore, it is less likely that the transcriptomic alterations we characterized are simply a product of the age of the mice employed. In fact, investigations of microgravity-induced differential gene expression in younger mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showed downregulation of metabolic and mitochondrial pathways, similar to what we identified in our older mice. Therefore, while DAS has not been adequately investigated in the context of spaceflight, it can be speculated that extensive microgravity-induced DAS may be identified regardless of age. Despite this, future studies investigating microgravity-induced DAS across mice of varying ages would provide vital context for evaluating age-dependent transcriptomic responses to prolonged spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par90">Second, previous characterizations of the transcriptomic and physiologic adaptations of skeletal to spaceflight have occurred in female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and both female and male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] mice, requiring inquiry as to the role gender (our experiments employed only female mice) may have played in generating the phenotypes we observed and the transcriptomic alterations we characterized. There is evidence in mice of sexual dimorphism in muscle physiology. Specifically, female mice tend to have greater type I (slow-twitch) fiber content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] and smaller fiber CSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>] than male mice. As a result of these anatomical differences, female mice tend to be more susceptible to both slow-to-fast fiber type alterations and muscle atrophy during hindlimb unloading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. Therefore, the magnitude of the microgravity-induced phenotypes we observed were likely magnified compared to what would be expected in male mice. More important to our work is the relationship between modes of transcriptome regulation and biological sex. In mouse models, sexually dimorphic patterns of alternative splicing have only been analyzed during sex determination in utero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. In humans, a comprehensive skeletal muscle transcriptome comparison between males and females revealed significant sex differences in the skeletal muscle transcriptome both at the level of DGE and DAS. Female-enriched transcript isoforms were associated with mitochondrial function, metabolism of acids and ketones, oxidation and reduction, cellular respiration, and fatty acid metabolism. By contrast, male-enriched transcript isoforms were found in the cytoplasm and proteasome, and enriched biological processes were almost all related to protein catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Ultimately, the sexual dimorphism of the skeletal muscle transcriptome suggests that while DAS is likely to be identified in both female and male mice exposed to microgravity, the downstream skeletal muscle gene targets may be sex-specific. Future studies investigating microgravity-induced DAS in male mice would provide vital context for evaluating sex differences in the transcriptomic response to prolonged spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par91">Third, many of the previous characterizations of the musculoskeletal adaptation to spaceflight have occurred in C57BL/6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], requiring inquiry as to the role strain (our experiments employed BALB/c mice) may have played in generating the muscle phenotypes we observed and the transcriptomic alterations we characterized. Similar to the discussion of the relatively advanced age of our mice, the physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle we identified are consistent with those characterized previously in C57BL/6 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] despite evidence to suggest strain differences in muscular remodeling, albeit in a non-microgravity context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. More important to our work is the relationship between modes of transcriptome regulation and mouse strain. Of note, a recent multi-omics analysis of data from NASA’s GeneLab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>] revealed that C57BL/6 mice were more responsive at a transcriptomic level to spaceflight than BALB/c mice, as evidenced by 5–10× more differentially expressed genes on average in C57BL/6 datasets than BALB/c datasets. Although Beheshti et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]’s work was limited to transcriptomic investigations of the liver, their findings are consistent with the approximately 10× less differentially expressed genes that we identified in the BALB/c quadriceps following exposure to microgravity (70 DGE genes; see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) as compared to what Chakraborty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] identified in the C57BL/6 quadriceps following exposure to microgravity (776 DGE genes). Although these strain-specific differences in DGE have yet to be investigated in the context of DAS, available evidence indicates that the transcriptomic adaptation of BALB/c mice may be less profound compared to C57BL/6 mice. Future studies investigating microgravity-induced DAS across C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice would provide vital context for evaluating strain differences in the comprehensive transcriptomic response to prolonged spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par92">Fourth, previous characterizations of the musculoskeletal adaptation to spaceflight have typically occurred following 2–4 weeks of exposure to microgravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], requiring inquiry as to the role time (our samples were collected following 9 weeks of microgravity exposure) may have played in generating the muscle phenotypes we observed and the transcriptomic alterations we characterized. Cadena et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] found that muscle atrophy is dynamic, with atrophy peaking in the gastrocnemius following 2–4 weeks of microgravity exposure and there being no significant difference in the weight of the gastrocnemius between flight and ground control mice by week eight. Our observation of statistically significant atrophy in the gastrocnemius following 9 weeks of microgravity exposure is likely indicative of our larger sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 10 versus <italic>n</italic> = 5) and/or our use of a different method for measurement of atrophy (CSA reduction versus weight reduction). Consistent with our findings, atrophy has been identified in both slow-twitch and fast-twitch muscles as well as both flexors and extensors after as long as 13 weeks of microgravity exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. In contrast to the time-course nature of Cadena et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]’s work, our study and most others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] employ a single, terminal timepoint for sample collection. This is a systemic limitation of microgravity research, such that acute and dynamic adaptations to microgravity are often unappreciated due to the limited capacity for in-flight sample collection, handling, processing, and storage, especially when studying tissues that require euthanasia for collection, such as skeletal muscle. Even time-course studies like Cadena et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>] are limited by small sample sizes and non-acute timepoints, such that what appeared to be potentially dynamic trends in expression of <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>MAFBx</italic>, two well-characterized atrophy genes, in the gastrocnemius across 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of microgravity exposure were unsupported statistically. Therefore, there is a definite need for similar studies using larger samples and earlier timepoints. Our hope would be that the work presented here would provide ample justification for investigation of acute and dynamic changes not only in DGE but also in DAS in skeletal muscle across prolonged spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par93">In addition to the design-based limitations discussed above, there are variables independent of our study design that may have impacted its results, including potential behavioral differences between spaceflown mice and ground controls. There are no formal behavioral analyses available from the Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) mission of which our mice were a part. However, Ronca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] analyzed the behavior of mice from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) mission that utilized the same NASA Rodent Research Hardware System as RR-5. Ronca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] found that both time spent feeding and post-flight body weight were comparable across flight and ground control mice. While we have no information regarding food intake during RR-5, we can report that flight mice of a different cohort than those used in this study were of comparable weight to ground control mice when measured 24 h after live return to Earth. Therefore, food intake was likely similar across flight and ground control groups, and as such, this variable is not expected to have impacted our results. In addition, Ronca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] observed high levels of distinctive circling or “race tracking” behavior in younger mice (16 weeks old at launch) but minimal race tracking in older mice (32 weeks old at launch). Although race tracking was not formally analyzed during RR-5, observations of video taken during RR-5 suggest that, similar to Ronca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]’s findings, our 30-week-old mice exhibited some but not a lot of race tracking behavior. Therefore, activity patterns were likely somewhat dissimilar across flight and ground control groups, and as such, this variable is expected to have impacted our results, albeit minimally. Considering this activity pattern would have activated the muscles analyzed here during microgravity, the magnitude of the phenotypes we observed was likely attenuated as compared to what would be expected in the absence of race tracking during spaceflight.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par94">In summary, we have shown that following 9 weeks of spaceflight (i) DAS and DGE varied in a reciprocal manner, possibly in response to tissue-specific energy availability, (ii) transcripts encoding skeletal muscle proteins were primarily differentially spliced while non-differentially expressed, suggesting a more prominent role for DAS than DGE in regulating the transcriptomic response of hind limb muscles to microgravity, (iii) DAS events were associated with the physiological changes to the gastrocnemius and quadriceps in microgravity, including muscle atrophy and the potential expansion of fast-twitch functional capacity, and (iv) RBPs, <italic>trans</italic>-regulators of DAS, were themselves differentially spliced while being non-differentially expressed. Together, the results of our work emphasize the importance of DAS in determining the plasticity and functional status of the skeletal muscle transcriptome in microgravity. This knowledge is significant because it allows for identification of new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Specifically, various small molecule splicing regulators have been recently approved for the treatment of atrophic neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscle atrophy and muscular dystrophy. These therapeutics act as splice-switching oligonucleotides that foster the inclusion of an exon (<italic>SMN</italic> exon 7, nusinersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]) or skipping of an exon (<italic>DMD</italic> exon 51, eteplirsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]; <italic>DMD</italic> exon 53, golodirsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] and viltolarsen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]), resulting in proteins with better functionality, associated with improvement in signs and symptoms of muscle disease. Ultimately, further characterization of microgravity-induced DAS will guide the search for small molecule splicing modulator-based therapies that mitigate microgravity-induced muscle atrophy, fiber type alterations, and other affiliated, detrimental physiological adaptations to prolonged spaceflight.</p>
