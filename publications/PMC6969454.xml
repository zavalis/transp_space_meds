                  <p id="Par2">The effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> after carried on the “SJ-10” satellite for 12 days was evaluated by proliferation, morphology, environmental resistance and virulence experiment. The result showed that the proliferation rate, biofilm formation, antioxidant capacity, cytotoxicity and filamentous morphology of <italic>C. albicans</italic> were increased in the spaceflight group compared to the control group. Proteomics and metabolomics technologies were used to analyze the profiles of proteins and metabolites in <italic>C. albicans</italic> under spaceflight conditions. Proteomic analysis identified 548 up-regulated proteins involved in the ribosome, DNA replication, base excision repair and sulfur metabolism in the spaceflight group. Moreover, 332 down-regulated proteins related to metabolic processes were observed. The metabolomic analysis found five differentially expressed metabolites. The combined analysis of proteomic and metabolomic revealed the accumulation of cysteine and methionine in <italic>C. albicans</italic> after spaceflight.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p id="Par24">In recent years, with the development of space technology, microbial space safety has become a research hotspot. It has been known that microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi have widely existed in the International Space Station [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. <italic>C. albicans</italic> is a common conditional pathogen that usually parasitizes on human skin, mouth, urinary tract, and reproductive system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While the pathogenicity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> may change with the changes in the external environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been reported that microorganisms including <italic>C. albicans</italic> proliferate more rapidly in the International Space Station [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], thereby multiplying the risk of onboard cross-contamination, colonization, and infection. Worse, the space environment can potentially alter microbial physiology and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the immunological investigations of the astronauts recorded several dysregulations, including lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and redistribution of leukocyte subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Together, the presence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> poses a potential threat to astronauts’ health. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism changes of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under the space environment.</p>
              <p id="Par25">A comprehensive understanding of the molecular communication will therefore provide new insights into this molecular mechanism. With the development of omics technology, high-throughput molecular identification and quantitation became available. Proteomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] could explore the expression of all the proteins of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under different environmental conditions. Metabolomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] is the study of the composition and variation of metabolic groups, thereby revealing the overall metabolic response and dynamic changes under different conditions. Thus, the results of integrated omics analysis could be useful for understanding the molecular mechanism of <italic>C. albicans</italic> with the rapid proliferation and enhanced toxicity under the space environment.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In this study, we took an integrative proteomic and metabolomic approach to identify the differentially expressed molecules of <italic>C. albicans</italic> carried by the SJ-10 satellite. The result of proteomic and metabolomic could reflect the phenotypic changes of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-omics approach to study <italic>C. albicans</italic> under spaceflight environment.</p>

                <title>Effect of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under space environment</title>
                <p id="Par27">After exposure to the spaceflight environment, <italic>C. albicans</italic> was recovered in the sabouraud-dextrose broth (SDB) medium and their survival was evaluated by OD<sub>600</sub> measurement. The same measurements were applied towards non-exposed control <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which were cultured at the ground. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A, the growth lag period of the spaceflight group was about 8 h after inoculated into medium, which was shorter than that of the control group (about 10 h). The mean specific growth rate of the spaceflight group was 0.44/h, which was faster than that of the control group (0.35/h, <italic>P</italic> = 0.018). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, the surface of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the spaceflight group was rougher and the wrinkles at the edges were increased when compared to the control group. The amount of biofilm formation was significantly increased in the spaceflight group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). Increased filamentous forms and budding with tight cell connections were observed in spaceflight <italic>C. albicans</italic> through scanning electron microscope (SEM), while grape-like clusters with sparse cell connections were observed in the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>D). The environmental resistance evaluation result showed that the survival rate of the spaceflight group was higher than that of the control group in the SDB medium containing hydrogen peroxide (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>E). However, no significant difference was observed between two groups of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in resistance to acid, alkali, alcohol, and salt (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The result of virulence experiment (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) showed that the spaceflight group had a lower maximum and a more significant decrease of the normalized cell index (NCI) compared to the control group, which indicates that spaceflight group has stronger cytotoxicity. All in all, the proliferation rate, biofilm formation, antioxidant capacity and cytotoxicity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> were increased after exposure to the spaceflight environment.

                <p id="Par28">In total, 3670 proteins were identified and 3499 proteins were quantified in the spaceflight group and control group of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by tandem mass tag (TMT) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S1). Proteins with ratios spaceflight /control higher or lower than 1.2-fold change with adjusted <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 were considered to be significantly changed. This resulted in 548 significantly up-regulated and 332 significantly down-regulated proteins in the spaceflight group compared with the control group (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2), which were shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A. Quantitative proteome data of <italic>C. albicans</italic> samples were used for hierarchical clustering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B) and principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).

                <p id="Par29">To identify biological function changes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> under spaceflight environment, KEGG enrichment analysis was performed with the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) by DAVID.

Among the 548 up-regulated proteins in spaceflight group, pathways including ribosome and DNA replication were enriched, which explains the increased proliferation rate of spaceflight <italic>C. albicans</italic>. In addition, base excision repair was also enriched, which related to DNA damage repair and may explain the increased antioxidant capacity of the spaceflight group. Sulfur metabolism was enriched in up-regulated proteins. While metabolic processes such as carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, propanoate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, and fatty acid degradation were significantly enriched in the down-regulated proteins.

                <p id="Par31">To integrate the result of proteome and metabolome data, we transformed protein ID and metabolites name to KEGG ID and KEGG compound, respectively. After mapping molecular objects to KEGG pathway, three pathways including purine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and alanine, aspartate glutamate metabolism were found to be regulated by both DEPs and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3). Among those three pathways, adenylsuccinic acid, which was up-regulated in spaceflight group, was mapped both in alanine, aspartate glutamate metabolism, and purine metabolism pathway. Consistent with the metabolome result, adenylosuccinate synthetase, which catalyzes IMP and L-aspartate to generate adenylsuccinic acid, was also up-regulated (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001, fold change = 1.17) in spaceflight group from proteome data. 5′-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a naturally occurring sulfur-containing nucleoside, which is a major by-product of polyamine biosynthesis involved in cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We found MTA was up-regulated in the spaceflight group with metabolomics analysis. While S-methyl-5′-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MEU1), which involved in the breakdown of MTA and responsible for the first step in the methionine salvage pathway after MTA has been generated from S-adenosylmethionine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], was significantly up-regulated in spaceflight group of proteomics.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par32"><italic>C. albicans</italic> is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which usually exists as a commensal organism but can become pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals under a variety of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Long term spaceflight with microgravity and motionless may have adverse effects on the immune system of astronauts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Meanwhile, Jiang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that simulated microgravity promoted the growth rate of <italic>C. albicans</italic> significantly. Altenburg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] found that the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in simulated microgravity results in an increase in filamentous forms of the organism, which is consistent with enhanced pathogenicity. Those reports indicated that the existence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the space environment might be threated to the health of astronauts. And the specific mechanisms of <italic>C. albicans</italic>’ increased proliferation and pathogenicity need further study. In this study, the combination of proteomic and metabolomic approach was used to study the effects of spaceflight on <italic>C. albicans</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of <italic>C. albicans</italic> under spaceflight conditions with proteomic and metabolomic analyses.</p>
              <p id="Par33">We explored the phenotypic change of <italic>C. albicans</italic> after exposure to the spaceflight environment. Increased proliferation rate and filamentous morphology of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in spaceflight groups were observed, which were consistent with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In addition, we found that the biofilm relative formation, antioxidant capacity, and cytotoxicity of <italic>C. albicans</italic> were increased in the spaceflight group. Crabbé et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported that genes involved in oxidative stress resistance were up-regulated in spaceflight cultured <italic>C. albicans</italic> with microarray analysis, which was consistent with our result. However, Hammond et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported that the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to kill wild type <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was reduced under spaceflight environment. The difference between their results and ours may because their experiment was done in the International Space Station with 48 h, while our spaceflight environment was low earth orbit flight for 12 days. The difference in space flight time and environment may have different influences on the microorganism.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Metabolomics only identified five DEMs. There may be two reasons for this result. First, we only used the LC-based approach to detect metabolites, which leads to the missing identification of less polar metabolites. Second, high abundance metabolites such as lipid metabolites were identified, while low-abundance DEMs may be lost. Although our results may lose many metabolites, the five DEMs could be used for further combined analysis. Integrated analysis of proteomic and metabolomic of <italic>C. albicans</italic> revealed that spaceflight may have an influence on cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway. On the one hand, we found that S-adenosylmethionine synthase (SAM2), which catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine, was increased in spaceflight group. This was consistent with the up-regulation of MTA, which is synthesized from S-adenosylmethionine. However, the expression of MEU1, which involved in the methionine salvage pathway by breakdown MTA, was increased in the spaceflight group. This may reduce the consumption of methionine. Meanwhile, 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate homocysteine methyltransferase (MET6), which involved in the formation of methionine, was also up-regulated (adjust <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, fold change = 1.13). On the other hand, bifunctional cysteine synthase (MET15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which has cysteine synthase activity and may synthase cysteine from serine, was increased in spaceflight group. Meanwhile, aspartate aminotransferase (AAT21) and aspartate transaminase (AAT1), which may play roles in catalyzes cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], were down-regulated in spaceflight group. So we concluded that cysteine ​​and methionine were accumulated in the spaceflight group of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Besides, methionine and cysteine are sulfur-containing amino acids, and proteins involved in sulfur metabolism such as sulfite reductase subunit alpha (MET10), sulfite reductase beta subunit, sulfate adenylyltransferase (MET3) and adenylyl-sulfate kinase (MET14) were simultaneously up-regulated in spaceflight group. Interestingly, many research reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] that most genes in methionine and cysteine biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated during biofilm formation. In addition, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] showed that the development of <italic>C. albicans</italic> was enhanced by addition of methionine and cysteine. The result inferred from the proteomic and metabolomic analysis was consistent with the observed influence on phenotypic of <italic>C. albicans</italic> after spaceflight.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="Par35">We explored the effect of spaceflight on <italic>C. albicans</italic> by combining proteomic and metabolomic analyses in this study. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic and metabolomic study on <italic>C. albicans</italic> after spaceflight. Increased proliferation rate, biofilm formation, antioxidant capacity, cytotoxicity, and filamentous morphology were observed in the spaceflight group of <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared to the control group. Proteomic analysis identified 3670 proteins and showed that spaceflight samples and control samples could be separated from proteomic data. Enrichment analysis with DEPs indicated that proteins in the ribosome, DNA replication, base excision repair, and sulfur metabolism were significantly up-regulated, while proteins in many metabolic processes were significantly down-regulated. Metabolomic analyses found five DEMs. The combined analysis of proteomic and metabolomic revealed the accumulation of cysteine ​​and methionine in <italic>C. albicans</italic> after spaceflight. This study showed that proteomic and metabolomic are useful tools that could explain the phenotypic changes of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
