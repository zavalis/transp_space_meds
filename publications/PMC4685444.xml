              <abstract>
                <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs can play important roles in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, the function of miRNAs in bone loss induced by microgravity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the differentially expressed miRNAs in both the femur tissues of hindlimb unloading rats and primary rat osteoblasts (prOB) exposed to simulated microgravity. Specifically, miR-132-3p was found up-regulated and negatively correlated with osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of miR-132-3p significantly inhibited prOB differentiation, whereas inhibition of miR-132-3p function yielded an opposite effect. Furthermore, silencing of miR-132-3p expression effectively attenuated the negative effects of simulated microgravity on prOB differentiation. Further experiments confirmed that E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300), a type of histone acetyltransferase important for Runx2 activity and stability, was a direct target of miR-132-3p. Up-regulation of miR-132-3p by simulated microgravity could inhibit osteoblast differentiation in part by decreasing Ep300 protein expression, which, in turn, resulted in suppression of the activity and acetylation of Runx2, a key regulatory factor of osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, our findings are the first to demonstrate that miR-132-3p can inhibit osteoblast differentiation and participate in the regulation of bone loss induced by simulated microgravity, suggesting a potential target for counteracting decreases in bone formation.</p>

            <p>Numerous studies have shown that mechanical stimulations play an important role in the maintenance of bone homeostasis, skeletal morphology and strength during bone formation and development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. By contrast, skeletal unloading, as observed in space flight astronauts or in patients subjected to prolonged immobility or bed-rest, typically induces severe bone loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The early studies described similar phenomenon, such as cancellous osteoporosis in weight-bearing bones, decreased bone formation and abnormal bone metabolism after space flight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. During the spaceflight mission on the Soviet/Russian MIR spacecraft and the International Space Station, crew members experienced a persistently enhanced areal bone mineral density lost at an average monthly rate of 1.06% from the spine and 1.0 to 1.6% from the hip, despite adopting an intense exercise regimen to counteract mechanical unloading<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Decreased bone formation in both rat cortical and cancellous bones was also demonstrated by tetracycline labeling before and after space flight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In view of spaceflight tremendous costs, more studies have been performed on the ground. The hindlimb unloading (HU) model is a well-tolerated method to mimic the cephalic fluid shift and removal of skeletal weight-bearing loads seen in spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Despite the variability of data among independent studies, this model successfully replicates an osteopenia characterized by decreased bone mineral content, weakened bone resistance, and loss of femoral mass, similar to that observed in spaceflight data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Moreover, cell-based studies have also been performed using rotational devices, such as the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) or Random Positioning Machine (RPM) systems. These devices constantly rotate around at least one axis to produce a vector-averaged gravity so that cells are unable to sense gravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Exposure to such rotational systems can significantly inhibit the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts while increasing the differentiation of osteoclast-like cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, effects that are similar to those of microgravity on bone cells.</p>
            <p>The mechanism of bone loss induced by microgravity has not yet been clearly elucidated. One point many studies have agreed upon is that abnormal osteoblast function and development are the main reasons for microgravity-induced bone loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Studies have demonstrated that the development of osteoblasts is markedly affected when exposed to real or simulated microgravity conditions. In a ground-based, simulated microgravity environment, human mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent cells that can differentiate into several lineages of mesenchymal tissues including bone, cartilage, fat and muscle, were accelerated to differentiate along the adipocyte lineage, whereas the osteoblast lineage was inhibited<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. During a four day space flight experiment, the flown osteoblasts grew more slowly and had lower growth responsiveness to serum stimulation than those on the ground. The cytoskeleton of the flight osteoblasts had fewer stress fibers, unique abnormal morphology and 30% smaller nuclei than the ground group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Several osteoblast markers, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osteocalcin, were suppressed after exposing MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts to RWV for 24 h<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, how the development of osteoblasts is regulated during microgravity exposure remains unclear.</p>
            <p>miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs ~22 nucleotides long that can participate in broad biological processes by elaborately regulating gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The application of microarray technologies can facilitate the expression profiling of miRNAs in many different tissues and cells because of its high sensitivity, throughout and comparative capabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Recently, several studies identified populations of miRNAs during osteoblast differentiation using microarray analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. miR-27 can promote osteoblast differentiation through modulation of Wnt signaling by targeting Apc genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Enhanced Wnt signaling further activates the expression of miR-34, another promoter of osteoblast differentiation involved in the regulation of Notch signaling, resulting in a sophisticated cascade regulatory network<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Osterix (Osx), a zinc finger transcription factor and critical regulator of osteoblast mineralization, was inversely correlated with miR-93, indicating a novel miR-93/Osx regulatory feedback loop in osteoblast mineralization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Our group demonstrated that miR-103-3p inhibited MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cell proliferation mainly by suppressing the expression of Cav1.2 protein, the primary subunit of L-type voltage sensitive calcium channels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. In addition, the expression of several important regulators, such as Runx2, BMP2, SATB2, and TGF-β, are controlled by different miRNAs during the multistep processes of osteoblast differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. miRNAs that serve as negative regulators have also been identified in bone formation. Overexpression of miR-182 in osteoblast lineage cells increases cell apoptosis and hinders osteoblast proliferation and differentiation by inhibiting the expression of FoxO1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. All of these studies suggest that miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, few studies have investigated the role of miRNAs in the regulation of osteoblast function under a microgravity environment.</p>
            <p>In this study, we screened for differentially expressed miRNAs in rat femur tissue after 3 weeks of HU using microarray profiling. Then parts of miRNAs were submitted for further verification and functional analysis in prOB cells cultured in simulated microgravity environment. Specially, miR-132-3p was found up-regulated and negatively correlated with osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. By suppressing the protein translation process of Ep300, an important transcriptional co-activator and histone acetyltransferase, miR-132-3p could significantly decrease Ep300-activited Runx2 activity and acetylation, resulting in the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. Further studies showed that therapeutic inhibition of miR-132-3p in osteoblasts resulted in a decrease of Ep300 expression, effectively blocking the negative effect of simulated microgravity on osteoblast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

                <title>Bone loss induced by unloading correlates with alteration of miRNA expression in rat femurs</title>
                <p>Hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats were selected for a simulated microgravity-induced bone loss model and monitored by micro-CT examination. The non-significant difference observed between control (CON) and HU body weights suggested that the stress caused by tail suspension was well tolerated by the rats. The dramatic decrease of fat-free femur mass in HU group after unloading for 3 weeks demonstrated the success of this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). The HU femurs presented with a typical osteopenia phenotype which was characterized by sparse, fractured and inconsecutive trabecular architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Three-dimensional architecture parameters also showed corresponding changes with significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD), relative bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and trabecular number (Tb.N) and remarkable increases in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and trabecular pattern factor (TPF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>
                <p>To test the hypothesis that miRNA expression of bone tissue is altered during bone loss induced by simulated microgravity, we performed miRNAs microarray profiling of femur bone tissues from the HU and CON rats. Among the 678 miRNA probes evaluated, expression levels of only 25 were significantly altered, with 11 miRNAs up-regulated and 14 miRNAs down-regulated in femurs of HU rats compared with that of the CON groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Some miRNAs were selected for validation by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) based on their fold changes. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of miR-139-3p,-339-3p and -132-3p were up-regulated, and the expression levels of miR-487b, -2985 and -34b were down-regulated during bone loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p>

                <p>To further validate whether the differentially expressed miRNAs keep the corresponding variation in osteoblasts exposed to simulated microgravity conditions, prOB cells were cultured in a Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWVB) clinostat and tested after rotating for 48 h. The effects of clinorotation were assessed by observing ALP activity and expression level of Runx2, the transcription factors critical for osteoblast differentiation (data not shown). Results of qRT-PCR showed that expression of miR-132-3p was significantly up-regulated compared with other miRNAs during clinorotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), displaying a similar variation in bone tissue. Next, a further experiment revealed the time-dependent variation in miR-132-3p expression which was kept a continuous increase upon rotating and peaked at 48 h and then subsequently decreased close to the normal level during a 96 h clinorotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>

                <title>miR-132-3p inhibits osteoblast differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
                <p>To evaluate the biological effects of miR-132-3p on osteoblast differentiation, the synthetic miR-mimic (analogue) and anti-miR (inhibitor) of miR-132-3p were transiently transfected into prOB cells to alter intracellular levels of miR-132-3p <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). The effects of those analogue and inhibitor on osteoblast differentiation were examined by observing the expression levels of the osteoblast-specific markers Runx2, Osx and ALP. qRT-PCR data showed that the gene expression levels of Runx2, Osx and ALP decreased following transfection of miR-mimic compared with transfection of miR-N.C.

                <title>miR-132-3p inhibits Ep300 protein expression in prOB cells exposed to a simulated microgravity environment</title>
                <p>miRNAs exert their effects mainly through binding to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of target gene mRNAs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. To obtain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of the regulation mediated by miR-132-3p, we identified the potential targets of miR-132-3p that are related to osteoblast differentiation using the miRNA target prediction algorithms TargetScan and PicTar, which have low false positive rates. Among the target genes predicted by both algorithms, Ep300 was the most promising candidate for it ranked highly among the predicted genes and has been reported to function as an important regulator of cell differentiation.</p>
                <p>To test whether miR-132-3p directly inhibits Ep300 protein translation by binding to a predicted target site in the 3′ UTR, a dual luciferase reporter system was constructed containing either the wild-type Ep300 3′ UTR sequence (WT) or an Ep300 3′ UTR mutant sequence (MUT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The luciferase reporter assay showed that the miRNA-mimic of miR-132-3p decreased, but the anti-miRNA increased, the WT Ep300 3′ UTR luciferase reporter activity but not the MUT Ep300 3′ UTR reporter. By comparison, miRNA-N.C. had no effect on the luciferase activity when co-transfected with either the Ep300 3′ UTR or the Ep300 3′ UTR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). This result suggests that Ep300 is a direct target of miR-132-3p. Further testing demonstrated that miR-132-3p mainly suppressed protein translation of Ep300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>) but had little effect on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Indeed, we observed a greater degree of change in the expression levels of the Ep300 protein (decreased approximately 37%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>) than of genes (decreased approximately 15%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>) after exposure of prOB cells to clinorotation for 48 h. It is possible, however, that the decrease in Ep300 gene expression we observed may involve some other mechanism and requires further investigation.</p>

                <title>Inhibition of Ep300 expression by miR-132-3p significantly decreases the stability and acetylation levels of Runx2</title>
                <p>Ep300 is a histone acetyltransferase that can add acetyl groups to lysine residues of histone or non-histone target proteins to protect them from ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Previous reports have shown that BMP2 signaling can increase the transactivation activity and inhibit the Smurf1-mediated degradation of Runx2 by stimulating Ep300-mediated Runx2 acetylation in the C2C12 cell line<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the suppression of Ep300 expression by miR-132-3p in prOB cells could decrease the stability and acetylation levels of Runx2. To test this hypothesis, siRNAs were used to silence Ep300 expression in prOB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). Next, the levels of total and acetylated Runx2 proteins were examined. Our data indicated that suppression of Ep300 expression resulted in the down-regulation of both total Runx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>) and acetylated Runx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>) protein levels in prOB cells compared with the control group. Thus, our results demonstrate that miR-132-3p directly targets Ep300 and inhibits osteoblast differentiation in part by decreasing Ep300 expression, which, in turn, leading to suppression of the synergistic activity and acetylation of Runx2.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Until now, the mechanism of microgravity-induced bone loss has not been elucidated. The present study demonstrates that miRNAs can participate in the regulation of bone loss under simulated microgravity conditions. Specifically, miR-132-3p was up-regulated by simulated microgravity and functioned as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Inhibition of miR-132-3p by anti-miR-132-3p effectively attenuated the negative effects of clinorotation on <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that miR-132-3p plays a pivotal role in bone loss induced by simulated microgravity and is therefore a promising candidate for new therapeutic strategies.</p>
              <p>During spaceflight, bone loss occurs mainly due to the lack of mechanical signal stimulations. These mechanical stimulations can be classified as two categories. One is the gravity which can be considered as a non-contact force. And another is contact force including static gravity-induced weight bearing, ground reaction force, and dynamic loading generated by muscular contractions during locomotion. To truly simulate the microgravity condition, we choose two kinds of models, the HU rat model and cell clinorotation model. In line with previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>, the HU rats in our experiments exhibited dramatic deterioration of the femur bone microarchitecture, as shown by the micro-CT analysis. Based on this model, the femur tissue was chosen for miRNA array profiling, and 25 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified for the first time. Of the differentially expressed miRNAs, several miRNAs, such as miR-20a, -181a, -34b, have already been reported to be involved in bone formation and osteoblast function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, confirming the reliability of our data. This high throughput screening revealed the relationship between miRNA expression and bone loss <italic>in vivo</italic>, truly reflecting the comprehensive body changes in microgravity, including effects of the nervous system and humoral regulation. Expression levels of some miRNAs were then examined in prOB cells exposed to clinorotation. miR-132-3p was up-regulated both in bone tissue and prOB cells after simulated microgravity exposure, suggesting its possible regulatory effects on osteoblast function. Two recent studies have also demonstrated the regulatory roles of miRNAs in bone formation and osteoblast function under a simulated microgravity environment. Wang showed that osteoblast-specific down-regulation of miR-214 levels could promote bone formation in HU mice, one of the three models they used to research human aged osteoporosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Our group also identified another miRNA, miR-103-3p, that inhibited osteoblast proliferation and L-type calcium channel function mainly through suppressing Cav1.2 expression under a simulated microgravity environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. To obtain a better understanding of miRNA-based regulatory mechanisms in microgravity, miR-132-3p was studied in more detail.</p>
              <p>Previously, miR-132-3p has been shown to play an important role in neurological development, synaptic transmission, inflammation, angiogenesis and even cancer. In neural cells, miR-132-3p promotes neuronal outgrowth and sprouting by decreasing the levels of p250GAP, a GTPase activating protein linked to neuronal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. It is notable, however, that some reports have indicated that miR-132-3p functions as a negatively regulator of the differentiation of dopamine neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. In addition, angiogenic factors, such as VEGF and bFGF, can promote transcription of miR-132-3p in endothelial cells, which further silences p120RasGAP expression and active conformation to induce proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. This angiogenic role could implicate miR-132-3p in the oncogenesis of cancers, such as chronic lymphoblastic leukemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, osteosarcoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>, and breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. All of these studies indicate a complicated and comprehensive regulatory role for miR-132-3p in cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the effects of miR-132-3p on osteoblast differentiation, particularly under the simulated microgravity conditions we described in our study, have not been previously reported.</p>
              <p>Runx2 (also known as Cbfa1) is frequently described as the master of osteoblast differentiation and is influenced by many key signaling pathways and transcription factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. The homozygous Runx2<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a complete deficiency of functional osteoblasts and do not survive because of lack of mineralized bone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. ALP activity is always used as an indicator of cell osteogenesis differentiation. Osx is a zinc finger transcription factor expressed in osteoblasts and required for bone differentiation and mineralization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that up-regulation of miR-132-3p in prOB cells significantly promoted the expression levels of Runx2, ALP and Osx, whereas down-regulation of miR-132-3p had an opposite effect on these markers. These data strongly suggest that miR-132-3p has a suppressive effect on osteoblast differentiation. It can be concluded that simulated microgravity can inhibits osteoblast differentiation partly by up-regulating the expression of miR-132-3p. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrated that silencing miR-132-3p by anti-miR-132-3p effectively attenuated the negative effect of clinorotation on <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoblast differentiation.</p>
              <p>To study the molecular mechanisms by which miR-132-3p regulates osteoblast differentiation, we predicted the potential targets of miR-132-3p by using miRNA target prediction software. Notably, the 3′ UTR of Ep300 possesses a 7-nt perfect match site for the miR-132-3p seed region predicted by both the TargetScan and PicTar algorithms. Ep300 has been reported to function as an important factor in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Our experimental data demonstrated that miR-132-3p overexpression results in down-regulation of Ep300 at the protein level, whereas functional inhibition of miR-132-3p by its anti-miRNA results in an increase in Ep300, strongly suggesting that Ep300 is regulated by miR-132-3p. Indeed, our Ep300 3′ UTR luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Ep300 is a direct target of miR-132-3p. Previous studies have suggested that Ep300, a histone acetyltransferase, is capable of increasing the half-life of Runx2 and its transcriptional activity through stimulation of Runx2 acetylation in C2C12 cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Another study showed that Erk activation can enhance the stability and transcriptional activation of Runx2 by increasing Ep300 protein levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, suggesting the possible involvement of Ep300 in the regulation of Runx2 expression. However, whether this function is maintained in the simulated microgravity-mediated regulation of osteogenesis remains unclear. In our study, overexpression of miR-132-3p decreased the transcriptional activity of Runx2 and was coordinated with the change during silencing of Ep300 expression by targeted siRNA. Thus, according to our studies and previous reports, up-regulation of miR-132-3p induced by simulated microgravity can decrease the acetylation and transcriptional activity of Runx2 by inhibiting expression of the histone acetyltransferase Ep300. The low levels of Runx2 attenuate the differentiation of osteoblasts and the expression of critical osteogenic factors.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that there are some limitations to our study. We examined the function of miR-132-3p in prOB cell differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> under simulated microgravity. However, the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects, such as whether silencing of miR-132-3p expression could counter the bone loss observed in HU rats, were not examined. Additionally, there are more than a hundred of predicted targets for miR-132-3p in TargetScan and PicTar algorithms. Whether these undisclosed target genes could participate in the miR-132-3p-mediated osteoblast differentiation is not known. These limitations should be addressed in future studies.</p>
              <p>To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that miR-132-3p serves as a negative regulator of the osteoblast differentiation in simulated microgravity by hindering translation of Ep300, which in turn, results in suppression of the synergistic activity and stability of Runx2. Importantly, our results demonstrate that functional inhibition of miR-132-3p can accelerate osteogenic differentiation and effectively attenuate the negative effect of clinorotation on <italic>in vitro</italic> osteoblast differentiation, suggesting that therapeutic approaches targeting miR-132-3p may be useful for enhancing bone formation and may be protective against microgravity-induced bone loss.</p>

The rats were anesthetized after 3 w of tail suspension. Bilateral femurs and tibiae were dissected and processed for micro-CT examination or total mRNA extraction. It is notable that the fat and connective tissues need to be stripped and bone marrow needs to be washed out when extract total mRNA for microarray test. All the experimental procedures were approved by the Committees of Animal Ethics and Experimental Safety of the Fourth Military Medical University (NO. 14022) and carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.</p>

                <p>The prOB cells were seeded at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well in 6-well plates (Corning, NY) and cultured for 24 h before experimentation. To examine alkaline phosphatase activity, confluent cell layers were washed with PBS, lysed with 0.1 M M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce, USA) for 15 to 30 minutes, and finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatants were then collected to determine their alkaline phosphatase activities using the alkaline phosphate (ALP) assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Technological Inc., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Keygene, Shanghai, China). ALP activity (IU/L) was defined as the release of 1 nmol p-nitrophenol per minute per microgram of total cellular protein.</p>

                <p>The fragment of the Ep300 3′UTR containing the predicted binding site for rno-miR-132-3p was amplified from rat genomic DNA. Amplicons were cloned and inserted into the XhoI/NotI cleavage sites of the PsiCHECK-2 vector (Promega, USA) downstream of the Renilla Luciferase reporter gene.</p>

                <p>2T3 cells were selected for this assay based on their low endogenous expression of miRNAs. 2T3 cells were grown to 85–90% confluence in white 96-well plates in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were transfected with 20 ng empty PsiCHECK-2-vector, PsiCHECK-2-Ep300 3′ UTR, or PsiCHECK-2-MUT Ep300 3′ UTR for 4 h in reduced serum and antibiotic-free Opti-MEM with Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were co-transfected with the pre-miR-132, inhibitor or a negative control (miR control) (RiboBio) at a concentration of 20 nM, respectively. Firefly and Renilla luciferase were measured in cell lysates using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) on a Fusion plate reader (PerkinElmer, USA). Firefly luciferase activity was used for normalization and as an internal control for transfection efficiency.</p>

                <p>Statistical analyses of the experimental data were conducted using SPSS 17.0 software. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three independent experiments. A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the time course variables of miR-132-3p expression when exposed to simulated microgravity for different time periods (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h). Statistical significance was tested using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test or a one-way ANOVA, and a <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.</p>
