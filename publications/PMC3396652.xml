              <abstract>
                <p>Endothelial cells are very sensitive to microgravity and the morphological and functional changes in endothelial cells are believed to be at the basis of weightlessness-induced cardiovascular deconditioning. It has been shown that the proliferation, migration, and morphological differentiation of endothelial cells play critical roles in angiogenesis. However, the influence of microgravity on the ability of endothelial cells to foster angiogenesis remains to be explored in detail. In the present study, we used a clinostat to simulate microgravity, and we observed tube formation, migration, and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC-C). Specific inhibitors of eNOS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) were added to the culture medium and gravity-induced changes in the pathways that mediate angiogenesis were investigated. After 24 h of exposure to simulated microgravity, HUVEC-C tube formation and migration were significantly promoted.This was reversed by co-incubation with the specific inhibitor of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (eNOS). Immunofluorescence assay, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that eNOS expression in the HUVEC-C was significantly elevated after simulated microgravity exhibition. Ultrastructure observation via transmission electron microscope showed the number of caveolae organelles in the membrane of HUVEC-C to be significantly reduced. This was correlated with enhanced eNOS activity. Western blot analysis then showed that phosphorylation of eNOS and serine/threonine kinase (Akt) were both up-regulated after exposure to simulated microgravity. However, the specific inhibitor of PI3K not only significantly downregulated the expression of phosphorylated Akt, but also downregulated the phosphorylation of eNOS. This suggested that the PI3K-Akt signal pathway might participate in modulating the activity of eNOS. In conclusion, the present study indicates that 24 h of exposure to simulated microgravity promote angiogenesis among HUVEC-C and that this process is mediated through the PI3K-Akt-eNOS signal pathway.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>It has been demonstrated that exposure to microgravity during space expeditions can induce many of changes in human physiological systems.These include loss of bone mineral density, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular deconditioning, and impairment of pulmonary function <xref rid="pone.0040365-CrawfordYoung1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The cardiovascular system is especially affected by space flight, with changes manifesting as cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac atrophy, orthostatic intolerance, and reduced aerobic capacity <xref rid="pone.0040365-Convertino1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The endothelium plays a pivotal role in maintaining microvascular homeostasis, regulating local blood flow, and other physiological processes <xref rid="pone.0040365-Cines1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recent reports have indicated that endothelial cells (ECs) on the interior surfaces of vessels are highly sensitive to microgravity and undergo morphological and functional changes under these conditions <xref rid="pone.0040365-Carlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0040365-Morbidelli1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Because ECs are key to vascular function, inflammation, and angiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction is likely to be one important factor of the basis of weightlessness-induced cardiovascular deconditioning <xref rid="pone.0040365-Coupe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Griffoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. For this reason, several studies have been devoted to the means by which microgravity affects endothelial cell functions. These studies have used a variety of in vitrocell models.</p>
              <p>Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form from pre-existing endothelial structures <xref rid="pone.0040365-Folkman1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that endothelial cell proliferation, migration and morphological differentiation play critical roles in this process <xref rid="pone.0040365-Bussolino1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. ECs are very heterogeneous, which is one reason why the influence of microgravity on ECs and angiogenesisis sodifficult to determine. Different behaviors have been observed in ECs cultured in modeled microgravity. Carlsson et al. found that the proliferation rate of endothelial cells to be increased under simulated microgravity <xref rid="pone.0040365-Carlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Morbidelli et al. obtained opposite results in porcine aortic ECs <xref rid="pone.0040365-Morbidelli1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The expression of many angiogenic molecules, such as nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and endothelin-1 are modified under microgravity conditions, which also indicates that microgravity conditions may influence angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0040365-Infanger1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Griffoni1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Mariotti1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>
              <p>NO produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) affects the regulation of vascular tone, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0040365-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0040365-Murohara1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. eNOS produces NO constitutively at low levels and can be transiently stimulated to produce high levels of NO by chemical agonists and by various mechanical forces. Growing amounts of evidence have established the involvement of NO in simulated microgravity-induced angiogenesis. NOS inhibitors block simulated microgravity-induced ECs migration, proliferation, and tube formation in vitro <xref rid="pone.0040365-Siamwala1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Many growth factors and hormones have been shown to induce phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt)-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS, which activates NOS and induces subsequent increases in NO production <xref rid="pone.0040365-Goetze1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Uruno1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. For example, in coronary arteries, Ang-1 has been shown to protect endothelial cells against oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced injury via a PI3K-Akt-dependent mechanism <xref rid="pone.0040365-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Dimmeler et al. demonstrated that shear stress activates eNOS by phosphorylation of the enzyme through the PI3K-Akt pathway <xref rid="pone.0040365-DimmelerS1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Fisslthaler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, thus far, little is known about the impact of microgravity on endothelial cell angiogenesis, migration, or the mechanisms underlying these processes.</p>
              <p>Parabolic flight and freefall can be used to simulate microgravity <xref rid="pone.0040365-Kraft1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, the duration of microgravity conditions generated in these ways is usually too short to alter cell growth or differentiation. Currently, many efforts have been made toward establishing alternative methods of simulating microgravity conditions on Earth. Clinostats are considered reasonably effective ground-based tools for simulating microgravity <xref rid="pone.0040365-Kacena1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Barjaktarovic1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. With the aim of better evaluating the pathophysiological modifications that microgravity induces in endothelial cells, we first hypothesized that the up-regulation of eNOS induced by simulated microgravity might be mediated via the PI3K-Akt pathway, thereby promoting the angiogenesis and migration of endothelial cells. In order to validate our hypothesis, we designed the current studies to determine the exact changes of endothelial cell angiogenesis and migration caused by simulated microgravity through in vitro tube formation and wound healing experiments. We then used many cell biology and molecular techniques to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p>

                <title>Simulation of Microgravity Conditions</title>
                <p>The clinostat is an effective, ground-based tool that can be usually used to generate hypogravity. The weightlessness created by a clinostat is often regarded as simulated microgravity. Under these conditions, cells cannot feel gravity; the gravity vector escapes its detection machinery. The machines described are used under the assumption that the inability to sense gravity has effects similar to actual weightlessness. The clinostat model system (clinorotation) used in this study is an equipment for providing a vector-averaged reduction in the apparent gravity on the cell culture. On a space station or spacecraft, gravitational forces are approximately 10<sup>−4</sup>. The 2D-clinostat used in these experiments only models certain aspects of microgravity, and the average gravitational force acting on the cells is reduced to about 10<sup>−3</sup> when the clinostat rotates at 30 rpm. However, these devices can be used to develop hypotheses concerning gravitational cell biology and to direct the design and scope of orbital flight studies. Our previous results documenting alterations in the function of HUVEC-C when cultured in the clinostat mimic the results obtained in true microgravity, suggesting the suitability of using these surrogate systems for bench-top microgravity research <xref rid="pone.0040365-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The clinostat and stimulated microgravity protocol are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040365-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The chambers were rotated around the horizontal axis.</p>

                    <p>The clinostat is equipped with computerized temperature and motor controls. Cells were initially seeded on coverslips, and then the coverslips were inserted into the fixtures of the chambers. After that, the chambers were filled completely with F-12K with 10% FBS (filling chambers with complete medium, taking care to avoid air bubbles). These chambers underwent rotation at 30 rpm around the vertical axis for 24 h. NG controls were static control cultures kept in the same room as the clinostat.</p>

                <p>Clinorotation experiments have been used to study the effects of simulated microgravity since 1965. When using the clinostat to simulate microgravity, it is important to solve the problems which affect the results of clinorotation experiments, including the shear stress and vibration generated by the clinostat. In the present study, we limited the shear stress by filling the chamber completely with the culture medium and invited a paralleled control to eliminated effects of vibrations. Cell rotary training was performed according to our routine protocols, as published previously <xref rid="pone.0040365-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Briefly, HUVEC-C were seeded at a density of 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells on 2.55×2.15 cm coverslips. After the cells grew for 24 h and adhered to the coverslips, the coverslips were inserted into the slots of the stainless steel fixture which could be placed into the plastics vessel and were situated 12.5 mm from the rotational axis. After that, the chambers were filled completely with the culture medium containing the abovementioned supplements by pipette. Aspiration was performed gently to eliminate air bubbles. The assembled chambers were randomly divided into three groups: (1) cells exposed to normal gravity for 24 h (Cont), (2) cells exposed to simulated microgravity for 24 h (Clino), (3) cells exposed to simulated microgravity in the presence of inhibitors (100 µM L-NAME or 50 µM LY294002) for 24 h (Clino+L-NAME/Clino+LY294002). These chambers were then fixed onto the clinostat (2D-Clinostat, developed by China Astronaut Research and Training Center). The entire system was placed in a humidified incubator at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and HUVEC-C of simulated microgravity groups were exposed to clinorotation at 30 rpm for 24 h. The NG controls were static control cultures kept in the same room as the clinostat.</p>

                <p>A pharmacological inhibition study was performed to investigate the role of eNOS in microgravity-stimulated angiogenesis. L-NAME is a highly potent eNOS inhibitor. The HUVEC-C were treated with 100 µM L-NAME in the medium. HUVEC-C complete medium containing L-NAME was replenished the 42 ml-vessels that were inserted into a rotary clinostat. The control cells were cultured in the absence of the eNOS inhibitor. The involvement of PI3K-Akt in the increases in eNOS levels that may have been induced by simulated microgravity was tested by using the PI3K-inhibitor LY294002 (50 µM).

Then 400 µl cells at 2×10<sup>5</sup> ml in F-12K medium were seeded onto pre-solidified Matrigel in each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 h with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Tube formation was observed using an inverted phase contrast microscope. Images were captured with a video graphic system. The degree of tube formation at 20 h was quantified by measurement of the length of tubes in five randomly chosen low-power (40×) fields from each well using Image-Pro Plus software. The control sample was defined as 100% tube formation, and the increase or decrease in tube formation relative to the control was calculated for each sample.

F-12K medium containing 10% FBS was added and the wound was observed 24 h later with an Olympus microscope at 40× fitted with an ocular grid. Images were taken with a Nikon Coolpix camera under phase contrast microscope. We measured the width of each denuded area and found the average.

                <p>To determine whether simulated microgravity affects the ability of HUVEC-C to form capillary-like tubes, HUVEC-C cultured under static control conditions and HUVEC-Cs exposed to clinorotation for 24 h were seeded in Matrigel and examined for tube formation microscopically. Between 1 and 2 h after plating, the HUVEC-C began to rearrange or align themselves in the control or clinorotation groups. By 8 h after plating, the clinorotation HUVEC-C had differentiated into an expansive and sharply defined tube network, but the majority of the control cells remained in individual clusters or ovoid colonies. At 20 h after plating, the clinorotation HUVEC-C showed a more extensive network of interconnecting tubes than control HUVEC-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040365-g002">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>). To quantify tube formation, total tube length was calculated using Image-Pro Plus software. Clinorotation treatment increased HUVEC-C tube length by 257±21% over controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040365-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).

                <title>Effects of L-NAME on the Promotion of HUVEC-C Tube Formation Induced by Simulated Microgravity</title>
                <p>In order to determine whether eNOS is involved in angiogenesis promoted by simulated microgravity in HUVEC-C, L-NAME was added into the culture medium and its effects were examined through tube formation assay. We optimized the dose to prevent inhibition of basal HUVEC-C tube formation. The optimal concentration of L-NAME was 100 µM. HUVEC-C tube formation was dramatically suppressed after co-incubation with L-NAME relative to the Clino group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040365-g003">Figure 3A, 3B, 3C</xref>). To quantify tube formation, the total tube length was calculated using Image-Pro Plus software. Co-incubation with L-NAME decreased HUVEC-C tube length by 252±17%, relative to the Clino group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040365-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

              <p>Angiogenesis, a process by which new blood vessels are formed, plays an important role in physiological and pathological processes in humans. ECs located in the entire inner surfaces of the blood vessels are the main players in angiogenesis. It has been reported that ECs are highly sensitive to microgravity, including the alterations in morphology and gene expression. However, effects of microgravity on ECs angiogenesis are largely unknown. Recently, Infanger et al. demonstrated that human endothelial EA.hy926 cells that were exposed to simulated microgravity formed tube-like structures (TSs) within 48 h of detaching from the bottom of a culture flask <xref rid="pone.0040365-Infanger2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Recently, they further described that these TSs consisted of several cell layers surrounding a central lumen. At the inner surface of the TSs, ECs were lined up and incorporated into abundant extracellular matrix so that the innermost layer of the TSs resembled the intima <xref rid="pone.0040365-Grimm1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The findings led to the idea that culturing ECs under conditions of modeled gravitational unloading could become a new strategy for engineering small blood vessels. In addition, it could become a new method of studying neovascularization, because angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> starts with the outgrowth of ECs, which assemble into tubes with tight cell-cell connections. Nevertheless, the angiogenic response of ECs to microgravity is still debatable. Morbidelli et al. showed that hypogravity conditions cause a marked impairment of ECs responsiveness to angiogenic factors and reduced their ability to migrate <xref rid="pone.0040365-Morbidelli1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Due to heterogeneity in experimental approaches, such as variations in the duration of exposure, levels of the gravity and cell types tested, the inconsistency of these results was understandable.</p>
              <p>There are great differences between in vivo condition and in vitro model with clinorotation to study the vascular endothelium changes induced by microgravity. Recent researches showed that an exposure to microgravity shifts the mean arterial pressure of the head from 70 mmHg in the upright posture on Earth to 100 mmHg in space, and the opposite alterations occurred in lower body vascular systems. The redistribution of blood flows induced by microgravity included changes of transmural pressures and shear stress within the arterial vasculature. Therefore, in microgravity environment, the alterations of endothelium in human were not only related to microgravity, but also to the hemodynamic changes in the cardiovascular and the imbalance of nervous-humoral regulation. To investigate the effects of simulated microgravity as a single stimulation on ECs function, we performed a series of experiments with clinorotation in order to eliminate hemodynamic influences. In this study, we carried out an in vitro tube formation and wound healing experiment to evaluate the effects of simulated microgravity on endothelial cell function. Our results showed that 24 h of clinorotation enhanced angiogenesis and migration in endothelium. Our data obtained here are in agreement with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0040365-Siamwala2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The cellular mechanisms involved in the alteration of endothelial functions induced by simulated microgravity are still not clearly understood.</p>
              <p>NO, which is manufactured locally in the endothelium, is an important mediator of blood flow control, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0040365-Namkoong1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Sessa1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. eNOS-derived NO is a crucial contributor to the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. The eNOS/NO pathway has been shown to exert a permissive role for angiogenesis in adult organisms <xref rid="pone.0040365-Namkoong2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Dulak1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Inhibition of endogenously produced NO or disruption of the eNOS gene has been found to reduce new blood vessel formation in an animal model <xref rid="pone.0040365-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Murohara2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Ziche1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have found that suppression of eNOS activation can inhibit angiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0040365-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of the eNOS gene at the transcription and translation levels using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot analysis to determine whether eNOS activation is involved in the mechanisms underlying the potentiation of angiogenic responses. After 24 h of clinorotation, eNOS mRNA and protein expression were both significantly up-regulated. We then examined the angiogenesis after co-culturing with L-NAME, a specific inhibitor of eNOS. As expected, the tube formation and migration induced by simulated microgravity were dramatically suppressed in HUVEC-C.</p>
              <p>Caveolae are specialized microdomains on the plasma membrane. They are involved in transcytosis and endocytosis, and a good body of evidence has shown that caveolae compartmentalize and integrate signaling events at the cell surface <xref rid="pone.0040365-Shaul1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040365-Beardsley1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. A variety of protein signaling molecules involved eNOS are concentrated in caveolae. Caveolae membranes are characterized by a group of structural proteins called caveolins. Caveolin-1, a widely expressed isoform in ECs, has attracted much attention due to its ability to anchor eNOS. The binding of eNOS to caveolin-1 inhibits eNOS activity <xref rid="pone.0040365-Dhillon1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Many studies have documented caveolae as endogenous negative regulator of eNOS function <xref rid="pone.0040365-Bernatchez1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0040365-Michel1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Enzo and collaborators found that endothelial cell caveolae could constitute a mechanosensing system involved in hypergravity adaptation of human endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0040365-Spisni1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. They also indicated that short microgravity exposure strongly affected eNOS activity associated with caveolin-1 (Tyr<sup>14</sup>) phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0040365-Spisni2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Therefore, they have proposed that one of the early molecular mechanisms responsible for gravity sensing of endothelium involves endothelial cell caveolae and caveolin-1 phosphorylation. In this study, we observed the ultrastructure of caveolae by transmission electron microscopy and found that 24 h of exposure to simulated microgravity not only impaired the structural integrity of caveolae but also dramatically decreased the number of them in the membrane of HUVEC-C. Decreases in caveolae density in the plasma membrane are correlated with enhanced activity of eNOS.</p>
              <p>All of these results confirmed that up-regulation of eNOS was correlated with the stimulated angiogenesis of HUVEC-C under simulated microgravity conditions. The mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of eNOS were then investigated. It has been reported that in ECs, eNOS is phosphorylated by the Akt protein kinase, resulting in an increase in eNOS activity. It plays a crucial role in the regulation of vascular tone, vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and NO production <xref rid="pone.0040365-Kureishi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Early studies have suggested that the VEGF-induced increases in the release of NO release from ECsare attenuated by PI3K inhibitors and that VEGF stimulates Akt-mediated eNOS phosphorylation, leading to an increase in eNOS activity <xref rid="pone.0040365-Fulton1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. It also has been shown to protect ECs from serum-deprivation-induced apoptosis and to promote the formation of capillary-like structures on Matrigel in an Akt-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0040365-Kureishi1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Dimmeler et al. reported that NO production in response to shear stress is controlled by the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS in cultured ECs <xref rid="pone.0040365-DimmelerS1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Taken together, these findings suggest that PI3K activates Akt, which in turn is responsible for regulating the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS <xref rid="pone.0040365-Igarashi1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, to examine the functional involvement of Akt and eNOS in simulated microgravity-induced angiogenesis, we determined the effect of the chemical inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002) on simulated microgravity-induced signaling events. After exposure to clinorotation for 24 h, the phosphorylation of both Akt and eNOS was increased by approximately 2.9-fold and 5.4-fold, respectively, over control values. Co-culture with LY294002 not only downregulated the expression of phosphorylated Akt, but also downregulated eNOS phosphorylation, which suggested that the PI3K/Akt signal pathway participated in modulating the activity of eNOS. These experiments provide the first evidence that activation of PI3K-Akt-eNOS is a crucial event in the simulated microgravity-mediated signal transduction that leads to angiogenesis.</p>

                <title>Conclusion</title>
                <p>The present study involves examination of the underlying mechanisms of angiogenesis in HUVEC-C after exposure to simulated microgravity via clinostat device. Our results suggest that 24 h of simulated microgravity can promote angiogenesis, migration, and eNOS expression in HUVEC-C. Further investigations have confirmed that the increased levels angiogenesis after simulated microgravity in HUVEC-C are mediated via PI3K-Akt-eNOS signal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0040365-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We plan a more detailed analysis of how microgravity affects the angiogenic process in ECs and we are currently investigating the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of simulated microgravity on the PI3K signaling pathway.</p>
