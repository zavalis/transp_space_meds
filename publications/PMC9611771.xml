              <abstract>
                <p>Lower back pain (LBP) is the primary reason leading to dyskinesia in patients, which can be experienced by people of all ages. Increasing evidence have revealed that paraspinal muscle (PSM) degeneration (PSMD) is a causative contributor to LBP. Current research revealed that fatty infiltration, tissue fibrosis, and muscle atrophy are the characteristic pathological alterations of PSMD, and muscle atrophy is associated with abnormally elevated oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation. Interestingly, microgravity can induce PSMD and LBP. However, studies on the molecular mechanism of microgravity in the induction of PSMD are strongly limited. This study identified 23 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the PSM (longissimus dorsi) of mice which were flown aboard the Bion M1 biosatellite in microgravity by bioinformatics analysis. Then, we performed protein–protein interaction, Gene Ontology function, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis for the DEGs. We found that Il6ra, Tnfaip2, Myo5a, Sesn1, Lcn2, Lrg1, and Pik3r1 were inflammatory genes; Fbox32, Cdkn1a, Sesn1, and Mafb were associated with muscle atrophy; Cdkn1a, Sesn1, Lcn2, and Net1 were associated with ROS; and Sesn1 and Net1 were linked to oxidative stress. Furthermore, Lcn2, Fbxo32, Cdkn1a, Pik3r1, Sesn1, Net1, Il6ra, Myo5a, Lrg1, and Pfkfb3 were remarkably upregulated, whereas Tnfaip2 and Mafb were remarkably downregulated in PSMD, suggesting that they might play a significant role in regulating the occurrence and development of PSMD. These findings provide theoretical basis and therapeutic targets for the treatment of PSMD.</p>

              <p>Lower back pain (LBP), including nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic, or non-specific pain, is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders and might be experienced by people of all ages (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As a global public health problem, LBP is known to impose a huge socioeconomic burden worldwide each year (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The maintenance of spinal stability depends on the coordinated movement of the active subsystem [paraspinal muscles (PSM) and tendons], the passive subsystem (vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and ligaments), and the nervous system (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The structure and the function disorder of any of the above components might contribute to LBP. The psoas major, multifidus, and erector spinae are the most important muscle groups of the PSM, which exert a critical role in maintaining the upright posture and the sagittal balance of the spine (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In recent years, increasing evidence have revealed that paraspinal muscle (PSM) degeneration (PSMD) is closely correlated with LBP and spine degenerative diseases, such as intervertebral disc degeneration and scoliosis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Microgravity is caused by factors such as the residual atmosphere in space, which is reported to affect the metabolism of human muscles and bones by regulating the gene expression and the molecular signaling pathways. The space environment is a microgravity environment; this environment can induce PSMD and intervertebral disc degeneration. Thus, microgravity is also a key contributor to LBP (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Nevertheless, the role and the molecular regulatory mechanisms of microgravity in the induction of PSMD remain largely unknown.</p>
              <p>Up to now, most studies focused on multifidus degeneration and spine pathophysiology (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Notably, the degeneration of the erector spinae usually occurs earlier, and the degree of degeneration is more serious than that of the multifidus (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The erector spinae consists of the iliocostalis lumborum, longissimus dorsi, and spinous muscles. The developing fatty infiltration, tissue fibrosis, and muscle atrophy have long been considered as characteristic pathological alterations of PSMD (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Muscle atrophy is associated with abnormally elevated oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inflammation (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Altered gene expression appears to be a hallmark pathological feature of PSMD. Yang et al. (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) found that the serum CXC chemokine ligand 10 concentrations were significantly increased in patients with PSMD compared with patients without PSMD. Kudo et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) observed that anti-muscular dystrophy gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF‐α and IL-6 were significantly increased in multifidus from patients with lumbar kyphosis (a reduced lumbar lordosis) compared with normal lumbar lordosis. The genes of the PSM were also differentially expressed in microgravity. Yamakuchi et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) found that 42 genes were differentially expressed in the PSM of rats after 14 days of space flight, among which the heat shock protein 70 and t complex polypeptide 1 were increased, whereas myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2C, aldolase A, and muscle ankyrin were decreased. Mirzoev et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) found that ubiquitin ligase MURF-1 was upregulated in the longissimus dorsi of mice after a flight of 30 days. Ogneva et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) found that the content of α-actinin-1/4 and β-actin, respectively, were decreased in the skeletal muscle of mice after a space flight on board the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days. However, the effects of microgravity on the gene expression of the longissimus dorsi (erector spinae) remain unclear.</p>
              <p>Gambler and colleagues studied the global gene expression profile in the longissimus dorsi of C57BL/N6 male mice after a space flight of 30 days and reported that several genes were associated with insulin resistance and PSM metabolism (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In this study, we re-analyzed this microarray dataset (GSE94381) downloaded from the public open Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<uri xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</uri>) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).

The GO database divides the gene functions into three parts: cellular component (CC), molecular function (MF), and biological process (BP).

The KEGG pathway analysis is a comprehensive database that integrates genomic, chemical, and systemic functional information. KEGG has four major categories and 17 sub-databases, one of which is called the KEGG pathway.

                <p>PCA is a technique for simplifying datasets, which reflects the difference and the distance between different samples by presenting multiple sets of data on the coordinate axis. The closer the distance in the PCA diagram, the more similar the sample composition.

The UMAP plot could clearly distinguish the different groups, which further supported the rationality of sample grouping (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figures 1D–F</bold></xref>).

              <p>Spinal degeneration and instability are not only due to changes in bone and intervertebral disc structure and function but also to PSMD. The limitation of the current research on the PSM is that they only measure the morphological parameters of PSM on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, including cross-sectional area, fat infiltration rate, <italic>etc.</italic> The understanding of the molecular pathological mechanism of PSMD is very limited. This year, Anderson et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) collected multifidus muscle for biopsy and confirmed that pro-fibrogenic and pro-atrophic genes were upregulated and that anti-fibrogenic and inflammatory genes were downregulated in patients with lumbar spine pathology. Nevertheless, the research on the molecular mechanism of longissimus dorsi muscle is still a blank. Gambler et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) observed moderate signs of longissimus dorsi atrophy in mice after a space flight of 30 days by performing hematoxylin–eosin, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses of longissimus dorsi in mice. This study re-analyzed the gene expression profile of the longissimus dorsi of mice exposed to microgravity for 30 days and found that several DEGs were correlated to oxidative stress, ROS, inflammation, and muscle atrophy, which are the pathogenesis of PSMD.</p>
              <p>PSM atrophy is a health problem that is currently receiving increasing attention. Identifying the relevant molecular mechanisms and blocking or alleviating PSM atrophy is therefore of utmost importance, yet the mechanisms leading to muscle atrophy are largely unclear. PSM atrophy may be driven by changes in molecules linked to oxidative stress, ROS, and inflammation (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Growing evidence has revealed that microgravity can alter the expression levels of muscle atrophy-related genes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). To further study the molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy in response to microgravity, we performed bioinformatics analysis. Muscle-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase Fbox32 (atrogin-1) was reported to be highly expressed in muscle atrophy and inflammation (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Anderson et al. (
<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) demonstrated that FBXO32 was found to be remarkably increased in multifidus muscle from 59 patients with lumbar spine pathology by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our study also predicted that Fbox32 was upregulated under microgravity, which was consistent with Gambler’s result (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Another E3 ligase muscle atrophy F-Box (MAFb) was downregulated under microgravity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Mahmassani et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) demonstrated that the expression of MAFB was downregulated in older adults and associated with the change in leg muscle mass. These findings are consistent with the results of our analysis. Additionally, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21 (Cdkn1a) is an inducer of cell cycle arrest and senescence-associated gene, which also serves as a mediator in controlling muscle atrophy (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and inflammation (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Kumar et al. (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) demonstrated that microgravity can substantially induce Cdkn1a expression, which is in agreement with our data. Sestrin 1 (Sesn1) was verified to be significantly downregulated in several models of muscle atrophy, including sarcopenia, and protect muscles against aging-induced atrophy (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, Sesn1 was significantly upregulated in mouse PSM in response to microgravity, but its roles and mechanism deserve further study. Thus, Sesn1, Cdkn1a, Fbox32, and Mafb might play a pivotal role in muscle atrophy under microgravity.</p>
              <p>Chronic muscle inflammation may contribute to the rapid loss of muscle mass, function, and myofibrillar proteins. Our study observed that Il6ra, Pik3r1, and Lrg1 were involved in cytokine receptor binding; Cdkn1a, Il6ra, Pik3r1, and Pfkfb3 were found as well to belong to the HIF-1 signaling pathway <italic>via</italic> GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, Li et al. (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) reported that the inflammatory gene PIK3R1 was remarkably overexpressed in the total T cells in COVID-19 patients. Liu et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) demonstrated that leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) may prevent renal fibrosis by inhibiting the inflammatory response and pro-fibrotic cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-6 is a common pro-inflammatory cytokine that regulates many inflammatory pathways. IL6RA is an IL6 receptor. Frempah et al. (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) demonstrated that the absence of IL6RA in keratinocytes can promote an inflammatory response. Wang et al. (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) confirmed that the inhibition of PFKFB3 significantly attenuated the inflammatory response in human valve interstitial cell. Faust et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) found that the decrease in Cdkn1a expression paralleled the reduction in cartilage tissue inflammation, suggesting that Cdkn1a may be associated with cartilage inflammation in osteoarthritis. TNFAIP2, a TNF-α-induced protein, which was an inflammatory-responsive molecule for TNF-α and was upregulated in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury patients (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Additionally, the expression of protease-activated receptors (PAR) is associated with inflammation, and MYO5A is a PAR1-dependent transcript, which has been implicated in the inflammatory process (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). LCN2, an inflammation-related factor with elevated expression in the skeletal muscle of ob/ob mice with sarcopenia, is associated with muscle atrophy-related inflammation and oxidative stress (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Keping et al. (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) demonstrated that SESN1 inhibited oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced activation of NK-κB signaling and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. Collectively, the abovementioned studies unveiled that Pfkfb3, Il6ra, Tnfaip2, Myo5a, Sesn1, Lcn2, Irg1, and Pik3r1 were inflammatory genes, suggesting that they might exert a key role in the pathogenesis of PSMD.</p>
              <p>Other causes of inducing muscle atrophy are oxidative stress and ROS, which were confirmed to promote muscle protein catabolism and inhibit protein synthesis signaling pathways (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). In addition to mediating inflammation and muscle atrophy, Cdkn1a was also involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and ROS under microgravity (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Sesn1 belongs to the family of stress-inducible proteins that regulate oxidative stress and ROS, thus protecting the cells from various stimuli (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Additionally, Lcn2 was confirmed to promote mitochondrial ROS production and alleviate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in rat primary cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). However, whether they mediate PSMD <italic>via</italic> regulating ROS and oxidative stress is an interesting problem which needs future experiments to be verified.</p>
              <p>Our study recognizes some limitations. First, the data was downloaded from GEO database, and we did not perform RNA sequencing. Second, we did not perform molecular biology and animal experiments to demonstrate the expression and the roles of the 12 key DEGs in longissimus dorsi muscle in mice. Lastly, there are inherent differences between mice and humans, so the generalization of mouse findings to humans is limited.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>In conclusion, a total of 23 DEGs were observed to be remarkably dysregulated in the PSM of mice in microgravity by bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, we found that Il6ra, Tnfaip2, Myo5a, Sesn1, Lcn2, Lrg1, and Pik3r1 were linked to inflammatory response; Fbox32, Cdkn1a, Sesn1, and Mafb were associated with muscle atrophy; Cdkn1a, Sesn1, Lcn2, and Net1 were associated with ROS; and Sesn1 and Net1 were linked to oxidative stress. Notably, Sesn1 was involved in the regulation of inflammatory response, muscle atrophy, ROS, and oxidative stress. These results suggest that they might be a therapeutic candidate target for PSMD treatment.</p>
