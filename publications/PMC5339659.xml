              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>While the peripheral nervous system has an intrinsic capacity for repair and regeneration, the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has a very limited ability to replenish neuronal loss following an injury, and is unable to regenerate correct axonal and dendritic connections between cells (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although an adult human brain has a few neural stem cells (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), these cells have a limited capacity to participate in regenerating processes (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In recent years, stem cell biology has provided the novel option for the study and cell therapy of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Due to ethical, biological, and safety issues, therapeutic use of embryonic stem cells has not been generally accepted. In the past decades, more attention has been paid to the use of adult stem cells in regenerative medicine (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p>
              <p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are heterogeneous populations of multipotent stem cells that can be isolated from different adult tissues, including bone</p>
              <p>marrow (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), adipose tissue (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), umbilical cord blood (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), peripheral blood (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), dermis (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), amniotic fluid (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and even tumors (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Since adipose tissues are abundant and easy to access by less invasive methods, they are ideal sources of adult stem cells. They are able to differentiate into mesodermal and non-mesodermal cell lineages, such as osteocytes (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), adipocytes (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), chondrocytes (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), cardiomyocytes(<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), myofibroblasts (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), epithelial cells (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), hepatocytes (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and neurons (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p>
              <p>Many studies have shown that neural-like cells derived from MSCs have the ability to repair CNS injuries (<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, recovery from injury after transplantation of these cells depends on the secretion of the appropriate amount of growth factors and their ability to survive for a long period. To date, different methods have been employed to induce neural differentiation of MSCs, and to increase the efficiency of differentiation, such as using chemical inducers, growth factors, and co-culture with neural cells (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In</p>
              <p>recent years, biophysical forces such as flow, shear stress, and microgravity are increasingly being used as a nove culture methodology to manipulate cells along with biochemical techniques (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Microgravity, as a mechanical factor, has been confirmed to affect cell growth and physiology. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effect of microgravity on intracellular signaling mechanisms, cell secretions, and gene expression. It has been shown that microgravity can stimulate the cell proliferation and cell differentiation, and triggers cells to grow within three-dimensional aggregates (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Furthermore, simulated microgravity can accelerate differentiation of MSCs (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p>
              <p>Briefly, the aim of present study was to investigate the effect of simulated microgravity on neural differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). We have analyzed the expression of neurotrophins (<italic>NGF</italic>, <italic>BDNF</italic>, and <italic>NT-3</italic>) and their receptors (high-affinity tropomyosin-related kinase receptors; <italic>TrkA</italic>, <italic>TrkB</italic>, <italic>TrkC</italic>) as main regulators of neuronal survival and death before and after transdifferentiation of ADSCs.</p>

                <p>Human subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from 5 healthy women (aged 34–48) undergoing cosmetic liposuction surgery and transferred to the Aerospace Research Institute, Tehran, Iran in sterile conditions. After removing the blood phase, adipose samples were washed with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS; Biowest, France) and used for stem cell isolation.</p>
                <p>Cell isolation was done as described by Zuk <italic>et al</italic>, (2001) (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Briefly, adipose tissue (suspended in HBSS solution) was digested with 1 mg/ml of collagenase type 1 A (Sigma, USA) for 60 min at 37 °C and continuously shaken to detach the stromal cells from adipocytes. Then, the adipose suspension was diluted with equal volume of DMEM media (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium; Biowest, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, France) to neutralize the collagenase and centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min. After discarding the supernatant (floated adipose cells), the stromal vascular pellet was dispersed in DMEM media containing 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Biowest, France) and seeded on a T25 flask (TPP, Switzerland). Cultures were incubated in humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. On the next day, cellular debris, as well as the non-attached cells were eliminated by changing the medium and replaced with the fresh medium. Adherent MSCs were maintained at 80% confluence and sub-cultured with trypsin/EDTA (Biowest, France) when required. Cell count was determined by hemocytometer. Cells at passages 4 or later were used for the analysis of MSC surface markers and differentiation experiments.</p>

                <p>ADSCs at passage 4 underwent FACS analysis for CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 to characterize stem cell surface antigen and the effectiveness of the selection method. These surface antigens are known markers associated with ADSCs (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Cells were harvested with 25% trypsin/EDTA and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3 × 10<sup>5</sup>/100 µl for each reaction) and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the phycoerythrin (PE) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated antibodies (BD Biosciences PharMingen, USA) against CD90-PE, CD105-FITC, CD73-PE as positive marker and CD34-PE, CD45-FITC as negative marker. Samples were analyzed using a Cyflow Space (Partec, Germany) flow cytometer. Data were then analyzed by the FloMax software (version 2.70).</p>

                <title>ADSCs multilineage differentiation potential</title>
                <p>Under the appropriate conditions, ADSCs have the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. In this study, to demonstrate multipotent potential of the isolated cells, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation were induced using human mesenchymal stem cell functional identification kit (R&amp;D systems, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
                <p>For adipogenic differentiation, ADSCs were plated into a 6-well culture plate at an initial density of 2.1×10<sup>4</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup> in Alpha-MEM media (Biowest, France) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% FBS and allowed cells to reach 90-100% confluence. After the cells reached confluence, the medium was replaced by the adipogenic induction medium (R&amp;D systems, USA): α-MEM, hydrocortisone, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, and indomethacin. The medium was renewed every 3 days. After 9 days, adipogenic induction was confirmed by Oil Red O staining of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Observation of Oil Red droplets with light microscopy indicated the differentiation of ADSCs into adipocytes.</p>
                <p>For osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs, ADSCs were plated into a 6-well culture plate at an initial density of 2.1×10<sup>4</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup> in Alpha-MEM media supplement-</p>
                <p>ed with antibiotic and 10% FBS and allowed cells to reach 50–70% confluence. After the cells reached confluence, the medium was replaced by the osteogenic induction medium (R&amp;D systems, USA): α-MEM, dexamethasone, ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, and β-glycerophosphate. The medium was renewed every 3 days. After 14–21 days, cells started to detach and osteocytes were prepared. Osteogenic induction was confirmed by Alizarin Red S staining of extracellular matrix calcium deposition. Observation of bright orange-red calcium deposits with light microscopy indicated the successful <italic>in vitro</italic> bone formation. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min at room temperature and then, washed with distilled water. Cells were stained with 2% Alizarin Red S and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr in the dark. After careful aspiration of the Alizarin Red S staining solution, cells were washed four times with distilled water and examined under light microscopy.</p>

                <title>Neural differentiation</title>
                <p>ADSCs were plated into a 96-well culture plate. Neural differentiation was induced as described previously (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Briefly, pre-induction was performed by discarding the medium and adding new DMEM medium containing 20% FBS and 10 ng/ml bFGF (Roche) for 24 hr. On the next day, the medium was removed; then neural induction medium (NIM) was added to the culture and was renewed every day by discarding half of the medium and adding new NIM. The composition of NIM was: DMEM supplemented with 2% DMSO, 10 ng/ml bFGF, 100 μM butylate hydroxyanisole (Sigma, USA), 10 μM Forskolin (Sigma, USA), 25 mM KCl, 2 mM valproic acid, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Samples were divided into 4 groups: 1- control group without rotation (samples in normal gravity; 1G= one gravity) in growth medium, 2- control group without rotation in neural differentiation medium, 3- simulated microgravity group with clinorotation (samples in simulated microgravity: 0.001G) in growth medium, and 4- simulated microgravity group with clinorotation in neural differentiation medium. The cells were monitored continually after neuronal induction and were used for RNA extraction or subjected to assays at specific time points.</p>

                <p>The expression of neurotrophin, their receptors, ADSC marker, and neural lineage markers were performed by real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated and differentiated samples using an RNA isolation kit (Cell Amp™ Direct RNA Prep Kit for RT-PCR; Takara, Japan), frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −75 °C until the time of use. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Prime Script™ RT reagent Kit (Takara, Japan) in a 20 μl reaction and according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>

              <p>In recent years, different studies have demonstrated that MSCs from adult tissues are multipotent cells, capable of differentiating into neural-like cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Most researchers used chemical reagents or growth factors to induce neural differentiation of MSCs (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>-<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These neural-like cells, derived biochemical manipulation of MSCs, have been shown to express some characteristics of neuronal cells. However, stability and efficiency of generated cells vary from one study to another, which is most likely due to differences in inducing reagents and the source of stem cells population. Recently, much more attention has been paid to biophysical forces, including microgravity to manipulate stem cells especially with the aim of cell therapy and transplantation (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Microgravity, as a mechanical factor, has been confirmed to affect cell growth and physiology. It has been shown that microgravity can stimulate the cell proliferation and differentiation, and triggers cells to grow within three-dimensional aggregates that are an ideal condition for tissue engineering. Furthermore, simulated microgravity can accelerate differentiation of MSCs (<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>-<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). In this study, we showed that microgravity increased the differentiation of MSCs to neural-like cells with biochemical factors.</p>
              <p>We could isolate ADSCs from 15 ml of adipose tissues. The morphology and characteristics of isolated cells were similar to that reported by others. Cells were isolated based on their ability to adhere to the plastic flask and confirmed through flow cytometry and differentiation to adipocytes and osteocytes. Flow cytometry analysis approved that extracted cells were positive for MSC surface antigens (CD73, CD90, and CD105), but negative for hematopoietic antigens (CD34 and CD45) (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Also our results showed that the isolated cells had multi-lineage differentiation potential (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). They were successfully differentiated into adipocytes and osteocytes. Accumulation of lipid droplets and calcium was detected by Oil Red O staining and Alizarin Red S staining at days 9 and 21 of culture in the induced medium. These results indicate that the isolated cells were ADSCs.</p>
              <p>Since the first attempt for differentiating MSCs to neural cells by Woodbury <italic>et al</italic> in 2000, different methods have been suggested. Woodbury used β-mercaptoethanol (BME), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) to differentiate human MSCs and showed the expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and</p>
              <p>neurofilament-M in differentiated cells (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In another study, neural differentiation of these cells was done using EGF and BDNF. They could detect the expression of neuron biomarkers such as nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (<italic>GFAP</italic>), and neuron-specific nuclear protein (<italic>NeuN</italic>) (<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Some other factors that have been used for neural differentiation of MSCs include: fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), dibutyryl cAMP, NT-3, NT-5, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and retinoic acid (RA) (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). We used Woodbury’s protocol for neural differentiation of human ADSCs, and compared the effectiveness of microgravity condition in this induction method. The morphology of cells began to change rapidly, and neural-like cells appeared in 3 hr after induction, which is why we chose this protocol. It is the appropriate protocol for simulating microgravity conditions by the clinostat instrument.</p>
              <p>In the current study, we observed that microgravity had a positive effect on the neural differentiation potential of MSCs. We found out that that the expression of neural marker <italic>MAP-2</italic> increased both before and after neural differentiation in ADSCs under simulated microgravity conditions. The flow cytometry analysis confirmed the real-time PCR results as the number of MAP-2 positive cells were increased before and after differentiation in a simulated microgravity environment, too. These results confirmed data reported by Chen <italic>et al</italic> (2011) and Yuge <italic>et al</italic> (2010) suggesting that simulated microgravity conditions enhanced neural differentiation potential of MSCs <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Chen <italic>et al</italic> showed up-regulation of <italic>OCT-4</italic> (pluripotent surface marker for stem cells) in rat bone marrow MSCs treated with simulated microgravity, which confirmes our results. The similar result was obtained for the neural marker, synaptophysin. Our data revealed that microgravity increased the number of synaptophysin positive cells with differentiation. However, in contrast to MAP-2 and synaptophysin, the numbers of GFAP positive cells were identical in both control (neural-like cells in 1G condition) and simulated microgravity groups after neural induction. GFAP is a neural marker for astrocytes in the CNS. It seems that microgravity had no any effects on ADSCs differentiation into astrocytes.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the present study revealed that microgravity environment increased neurotrophin’s expression and their specific <italic>Trk</italic> receptors especially <italic>BDNF</italic> and <italic>TrkB</italic>. The expression of neurotrophins and their receptors are crucial for cell transplantation of neurodegenerative diseases. NTs are target-derived factors, which induce the survival, differentiation, development and function of different neurons both in peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). They act through two classes of receptors: the high-affinity Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors and the low-affinity pan-NT receptor p75 (p75NTR). Reports suggest that binding of NTs to their common p75 receptor in the absence of Trk receptors causes neuronal death (<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). It is clear from our study that microgravity increased the expression of <italic>BDNF</italic>, <italic>NT-3</italic>, <italic>TrkB</italic>, and <italic>TrkC</italic> both before and after neural induction. Also, the expression of <italic>NGF</italic> was increased after microgravity simulation but it was negligible. Based on the expression levels of <italic>NGF</italic> obtained in control groups (before and after differentiation) before microgravity treatment, weightlessness had no impact on the expression of NGF before and after differentiation. Chen <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) reported up-regulation of <italic>NGF</italic> and <italic>BDNF</italic> in MSCs after microgravity induction, too. In contrast to the up-regulation of <italic>NGF</italic> and <italic>BDNF</italic>, their experiment detected the expression of neurotrophins decreased significantly either in microgravity environment or in normal gravity conditions after neural induction. The present observation stands in contrast to our study, which may be due to differences in neural induction protocol and time of gene expression analysis. They used b-FGF, human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) to induce neural induction and evaluated gene expression of neurotrophins after 7 day induction. Also, we found that the morphology of ADSCs was changed from spindle to round under microgravity conditions compared to the 1G control, similar to that reported by others (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Chen <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that the morphology changes of MSCs in a microgravity environment is due to microtubules and cytoskeleton reorganization that could affect cell fate. Researchers in 2004 have shown that cell shape, cytoskeletal tension, and RhoA could regulate stem cell lineage commitment (<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p>

              <p>Our findings provide a new strategy for differentiation of ADSCs to neural-like cells and probably other cell lineages. Based on our results, microgravity could be used as a new method besides traditional techniques to increase the efficiency of cell transplantation in medicine.
