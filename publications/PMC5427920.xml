                <p>Despite the observed severe effects of microgravity on mammalian cells, many astronauts have completed long term stays in space without suffering from severe health problems. This raises questions about the cellular capacity for adaptation to a new gravitational environment. The International Space Station (ISS) experiment TRIPLE LUX A, performed in the BIOLAB laboratory of the ISS COLUMBUS module, allowed for the first time the direct measurement of a cellular function in real time and on orbit. We measured the oxidative burst reaction in mammalian macrophages (NR8383 rat alveolar macrophages) exposed to a centrifuge regime of internal 0âg and 1âg controls and step-wise increase or decrease of the gravitational force in four independent experiments. Surprisingly, we found that these macrophages adapted to microgravity in an ultra-fast manner within seconds, after an immediate inhibitory effect on the oxidative burst reaction. For the first time, we provided direct evidence of cellular sensitivity to gravity, through real-time on orbit measurements and by using an experimental system, in which all factors except gravity were constant. The surprisingly ultra-fast adaptation to microgravity indicates that mammalian macrophages are equipped with a highly efficient adaptation potential to a low gravity environment. This opens new avenues for the exploration of adaptation of mammalian cells to gravitational changes.</p>

              <p>The gravitational force has been constant throughout the 4 billion years of Earthâs evolutionary history<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and probably played a crucial role in the evolutionary explosion of organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. All terrestrial life, including man, has adapted to this fundamental force by developing a number of important features in their composition and functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, whereas changes of the gravitational environment induce strong alterations of human physiological systems, which respond and adapt to the new gravitational environment within hours or weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Importantly, microgravity has been demonstrated to have profound effects at the cellular and molecular level, including changes in cell morphology, proliferation, growth, differentiation, signal transduction and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In spite of the witnessed serious and often disastrous effects on cells, many astronauts have now completed long term stays in space without suffering from any severe health problem associated with the effect of microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Regarding the innate component of the immune response, the magnitude of the change during spaceflight is not great or the pattern of change across various functions is not consistent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This leads to the hypothesis that the cells of the body must have an enormous capacity to adapt to microgravity, be capable of reacting to altered environmental conditions and of restoring cellular functions to a considerable degree. In this regard, isolated cells are an ideal study object for the investigation of the impact of microgravity without any disturbing or masking secondary effects. Some studies reported that key cellular mechanisms are altered in microgravity, followed by an adaptation of the system to the new circumstances by executing countermeasure actions. Such countermeasures include the modification of the cytoskeleton and nuclear morphology, which occurs after 32âhours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It was recommended by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine of the US to investigate the reversibility of the changes that occur during and after flight more carefully<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In our study, we demonstrated for the first time and through real-time measurements on board of the International Space Station (ISS) that mammalian cells have the capacity to adapt to microgravity within seconds.</p>
              <p>Three reasons led us to choose the oxidative burst reaction in mammalian macrophages for real-time measurements of cellular effects of gravity on board of the ISS. Firstly, the oxidative burst reaction represents one of the key elements in the innate immune response, and it is the most important barrier against microbes invading the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Secondly, it is a very ancient part of the immune system. NADPH oxidases, enzymes which transport electrons and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), were present from the earliest stages of evolution in every type of multicellular life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Thirdly, our previous experiments demonstrated that the oxidative burst reaction is inhibited in microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This fast inhibition facilitates the determination of threshold levels of gravity sensitivity and the investigation of adaptation and re-adaptation effects.</p>

                <p>We developed the TRIPLE LUX A experiment system, which enables real-time on orbit measurement of oxidative burst reaction in mammalian NR8383 macrophage cells and the following real-time data downlink to Earth (FigsÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Two different BIOLAB centrifuge regimes (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), one with step-wise decrease from 1âg to 0âg and sudden increase back to 1âg (Run1) and the other with a sudden decrease from 1âg to 0âg and step-wise increase back to 1âg (Run2), allowed for the determination of gravity threshold levels in the mammalian cell system and immediate 0âg/1âg transitions with subsequent constant gravitational force for the investigation of adaptation effects. After the frozen storage on orbit, cells were thawed and adapted to 1âg for 3âh in the BIOLAB centrifuge (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The thawing and initial 1âg centrifuge regime ensured that the cells were not exposed to 0âg at any time before the experiment. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> illustrates the raw signals of the two on orbit runs and two ground reference experiments. In all four independent experiments of Run2, the oxidative burst reaction rapidly declined after the transition from 1âg to 0âg (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4aâc</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Hardware of the ISS experiment TRIPLE LUX A.

<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) BIOLAB centrifuge regimes with step-wise increase or decrease of gravity. Two different centrifuge regimes, one with step-wise increase (from 0âg to 1âg, Run2) and the other with step-wise decrease (from 1âg to 0âg, Run1) of the gravity levels, allowed the determination of gravity thresholds in the mammalian cell system and the investigation of adaptation and re-adaptation effects. The two runs were performed sequentially, each run was subjected to a specific centrifuge regime after the zymosan/horseradish peroxidase injection into the MBs: Run1 started with a 1âg baseline, followed by a step-wise decrease from 1âg to 0âg in 0.1âg/2.8âmin steps, a 15âmin 0âg phase and finally a rapid increase to 1âg. Run2 started with a 1âg baseline, followed by a 15âmin 0âg phase, a step-wise increase from 0âg to 1âg in 0.1âg/2.8âmin steps and finally a 1âg phase. The centrifuge transition times of the 0.1âg steps were 2â4âs between 0.1âg and 1âg and 6â9âs between 0âg and 0.1âg, the direct transition time between 1âg and 0âg was 30âs.

                <title>Direct evidence of rapid adaptation to microgravity</title>
                <p>The decline of the oxidative burst reaction started 30.9âsâ+/ââ10.5âs after the centrifuge stop command. At this point the residual gravitational force was between 1.05âÃâ10<sup>â1</sup> g and 5.98âÃâ10<sup>â6</sup> g (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The interval between the BIOLAB centrifuge stop command at 34.033âmin and full centrifuge stop at 34.533âmin after the start of the measurement (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> step 9) was 30âs (T1 and T2 in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and blue lines in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore, the oxidative burst declined immediately after a microgravity environment was achieved. In previous parabolic flight experiments we found an immediate (timeframe of a second) decline of the oxidative burst reaction with the onset of microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which could be therefore confirmed on orbit. The functional onset of the adaptation processes (=minimum of the oxidative burst curve, triangles in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) was measured after 14âsâÂ±â7âs and the oxidative burst recovered to its initial value after 42âsâÂ±â15âs (squares in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) in the microgravity environment. The burst signal decrease by a mean of 2095 RLU upon microgravity onset was found to be highly significant and the strongest signal jump over 500âminutes of measurement. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows the signal differences between consecutive time points as recorded by the four photomultiplier tubes (PMTs, one per individual experiment) of Run2. This signal difference provides a measure of the raw signal changes during Run2. The most extreme signal change over the entire acquisition period (consisting of 128â199 signal changes) was identified at time points 34.66âmin, 34.7âmin, and 34.72âmin, for PMT 2, 3 and 4, respectively (red arrows in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). These extreme signal changes correspond to the dip noted on the raw signal (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and correlate exactly with the centrifuge stop and the transition from 1âg to 0âg. For the PMT1 measurement, there is also a strong signal change at 34.36âmin correlating with the onset of microgravity but it was less extreme than in the other 3 PMTs (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5aâc</xref>). However, also for the average of the signal differences across all four PMT measurements the most extreme signal change over the whole measurement time of 500âminutes was found at 34.66âmin and is perfectly in the timeframe of the onset of microgravity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Raw signal differences of consecutive measurement time points as a function of time.

                <title>Indication of thresholds in the sensitivity to gravity</title>
                <p>For comparison across experimental conditions, the raw signals were synchronized in time (setting the time of zymosan injection as t<sub>0</sub>) and normalized by their peak intensity thereby accounting for variations in the time of reaction initiation and PMT readings. The normalized signals (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>) testify for the reproducibility within a given experimental condition. The average of the first derivative of the four independent PMT signals of Run1 revealed a minimum of the first derivative 3âmin after the return to 1âg (blue arrow), followed by an increase which could indicate re-adaption to the 1âg gravitational environment (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b,c</xref>). For stepwise increase of the gravitational force (Run2), the minimum of the first derivative was detected between 0.3 and 0.5âg (red arrow), followed by an increase, which may suggest a threshold of sensitivity to gravity between 0.3â0.5âg (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b,c</xref>). Therefore, all four independent experiments of Run2 exhibited an immediate inhibitory effect of microgravity on the oxidative burst reaction, followed by a full adaptation to the new gravitational environment in less than one minute (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Furthermore, we detected rapid re-adaption to the 1âg environment and indications for a gravitational threshold of the oxidative burst reaction between 0.3âg and 0.5âg (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In contrast, Run1 exhibited no detectable difference to the ground reference experiments during the initial phases of the burst reaction including the step-wise g-level increase (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). The comparison of the data points of the averaged curves of all four experimental runs showed that for the half time up, the maximum of the curves and the half time down values, Run1 is similar to the technical ground reference experiments GRE1 and GRE2, which demonstrates that stepwise reduction of the gravitational force in 0.1âg increments â compared to the 1.0âg increment of Run2 - was not transduced into a detectable functional cellular reaction to altered gravity (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref> and TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, Run2 reaches the designated data points up to 9âminutes earlier indicating an enhanced burst reaction (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Differences may be explained by super-fast adaptation processes, which are probably below the low limit of detection for changes of 0.1âg (Run1), but detectable for changes of 1.0âg (Run2).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Comparison of the oxidative burst reaction rate across experimental conditions.

However, most of our knowledge about the effects of spaceflight on the immune system resulted from the analysis of samples subjected to short spaceflights or ground-based simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and cellular experiments performed so far were endpoint measurements, analyzed on ground. The exact cause of the observed changes to the immune system from spaceflight environment has remained undiscovered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our experiment, we were able to provide for the first time, direct evidence of cellular sensitivity to gravity through real-time on orbit measurements using an experiment system of NR8383 rat macrophage cells, in which all factors except gravity were constant. Our previous results of a rapid decline of the oxidative burst reaction during a parabolic flight experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> could be confirmed by this independent ISS experiment, with completely different hardware, logistics, experiment process and cell culture conditions, indicating a very robust and reproducible finding. Importantly, in all 2D clinostat ground experiments conducted with exactly the same experiment system and in preparation for the ISS experiment TRIPLE LUX A, no adaptation was detected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, our studies provided not only direct evidence of sensitivity and rapid adaptation of mammalian cells to a microgravity environment, but also clear indications that adaption mechanisms react directly in response to microgravity, because they were not activated in a simulated microgravity environment of sedimentation-free and vector-averaged gravity.</p>
              <p>The molecular mechanisms with which oxidative burst reacts and adapts to a new gravitational environment are yet unknown. Discussions of whether an <italic>in vitro</italic> single cell or a cell population can sense changes in the gravitational field are very controversial and theoretical considerations suggest that the forces involved are too small to trigger any cellular response to the changed environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In spite of these theories, experimental data indicate that several types of cultured cells are sensitive to gravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, pointing to the cytoskeleton as a potential initial gravity sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In our study we demonstrated direct evidence of a cellular response to microgravity. Additionally, the rapid reaction and adaptation of oxidative burst reaction suggests a direct effect at the level of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase complex, which is closely associated with cytoskeletal dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and linked to areas where tension and compression sensitivity are located<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. RhoGTPases are interesting candidates to explain the structural cellular changes in microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. As demonstrated in bone marrow polymorphonuclear leukocytes, RhoA activity not only responds within seconds upon stimulation, but is also associated with NADPH oxidase activation and oxidative burst reaction in time frames less than one minute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In a previous study, repression of RhoA activation in bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells was observed after 72âh simulated microgravity (3D clinorotation), following down regulation of Rho-activating LARG (leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor) expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, p67phox, an essential structural component of the NADPH oxidase complex, is a target of Rac 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which is crucial for microgravity-induced alterations of the cytoskeleton and focal adhesions, demonstrated in MG-63 osteoblast-like cells silenced for RhoGTPases during the Foton M3 satellite mission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, decrease of RhoA and increase of Rac1 activity could explain the rapid adaptation of the oxidative burst reaction in microgravity. Such dynamic reactions should be investigated in live-imaging studies as soon as this technology becomes operational for on-orbit experiments at ISS.</p>
              <p>Numerous studies have reported that an altered gravitational environment or spaceflight have various and complex effects on cells and organisms, including cells of the monocyte-macrophage system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Cells of the monocyte-macrophage system in microgravity demonstrated disturbed cytokine release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, reduced oxidative burst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, alteration of the cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, reduction in their locomotion ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, significant changes in gene expression associated with macrophageal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> and activation of syk signal pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> in microgravity. Because of the demonstrated direct evidence of ultra-fast adaptation mechanisms, results from previous <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in microgravity and in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> could represent not only and necessarily direct and primary effects of microgravity, but also molecular hallmarks of adaption processes, which may be initiated as fast as a few seconds after the onset of microgravity.</p>
              <p>These adaptations appear to include very complex changes of cellular and molecular parameters. Due to the fact that gravity has been constant throughout the history of Earth and evolution of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, no pre-set adaptation program or genetic memory of life responding to gravitational force changes can be expected. Cellular response to altered gravity may be less organized than other adaptation processes, yet many of the so far investigated terrestrial organisms are able to perceive gravitational forces in the range of 10<sup>â3</sup> g. This happens in spite of the Earthâs acceleration of 1âg, which has been constantly present over millions of years, an enigma named the âgravi-paradoxâ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The weakening of the immune system in microgravity conditions triggered a lot of concern about human health during exploration class missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. While there is much knowledge about the immune status that immediately follows the conclusion of a spaceflight, the understanding on immunity during spaceflight is still limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Research on the ISS may finally determine the immune status during long-duration spaceflight, and the successful closure of this clinical risk and, if required, by using the appropriate countermeasures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Humans are ready to accept great risks in order to venture where no one has gone before, but there is a need for sufficient and sound biological information in order to support prolonged space habitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that mammalian cells may be equipped with an extraordinary fast and efficient adaptation potential when challenged with low gravitational environments. Interestingly, maize roots demonstrated the opposite effect, an enhanced oxidative burst in microgravity, which could be directly linked to the role of ROS as a messenger during the gravi-tropic response in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Like other environmental factors, the gravitational force may determine the boundaries for life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, where exploring the physical limits of organismic viability is crucial in the search for life in extraterrestrial habitats by narrowing down possible targets to search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our results imply that mammalian cells are equipped with a surprisingly ultra-fast and efficient adaptation potential to low gravity and that therefore key cellular functions of multicellular life could adapt to and exist in a low gravity environment. Since RhoGTPases are interesting candidates to explain the rapid adaptation of the oxidative burst reaction in microgravity, these molecules should be considered as interesting targets for countermeasures against microgravity-related cellular dysfunctions. However, dynamic monitoring of molecular activities in real microgravity is of crucial importance, and appropriate live imaging experiments on board of the International Space Station will be the key to understand the molecular dynamics of cellular adaptation to microgravity in the future.</p>

                <title>Experiment sequence</title>
                <p>The experiment on board the ISS started with pre-warming the BIOLAB Rack to 37âÂ°C. Thereafter, the pre-filled HMPU was integrated into the BIOLAB centrifuge. The ELBs were thawed and mixed manually by the astronaut and implemented into the Automatic Ambient Stowage-Insert (AAS-I). Subsequently, the NR8383 cells in the SCB were thawed and mixed by the astronaut and integrated into the designated space in the HMPU (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The following experiment sequence inside the BIOLAB Rack proceeded automatically. Liquids were transferred by the automated handling mechanism (HM) from the AAS-I into IFB1 and IFB2 and from the SCB into MB1-4. The HMPU containing cells and chemicals was centrifuged at 1âg at 37âÂ°C for 3âh for cell recovery. The measurement started by recording of the background signal, followed by pumping of liquids from IFB1 and IFB2 into MB1-4 to start the oxidative burst reaction. After injection of the fluids from IFB1 and IFB2, the concentrations in MB1-4 were 0.44âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> NR8383 cells per ml, 1.7âmM luminol, 1.1âmg/ml zymosan and 55.85âU/ml HRP. A baseline signal for the oxidative burst reaction under 1âg conditions was recorded for 5âmin before the centrifuge regimes specific for Run1 and Run2 were followed (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The centrifuge regimes consisted of internal 0âg and 1âg controls and step-wise decrease (Run1) or increase (Run2) of gravity levels (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Each one of these two runs included four independent experiments conducted in parallel. Real-time luminescence data was recorded in four independent parallel experiments and sent down to the Microgravity User Support Center (MUSC, German Aerospace Center) where the oxidative burst signal of the cells could be followed live. After the flight, the data was analyzed and processed when necessary. The ground reference experiments (GRE1 and GRE2) were conducted in the Biolab engineering model (EM) following the same procedure as the flight experiments except that there was no centrifugation included. Instead, the cells recovered for 3âh under Earth 1âg conditions at 37âÂ°C.</p>

                <title>Data Analysis</title>
                <p>We could observe in the raw signals from Run2 orbit experiment (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) that a burst signal decrease happened at the transition time when gravity changed from 1âg to 0âg. This observation was confirmed when further investigating the signal changes in more detail. The data processing workflow is illustrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Data analysis workflow. Blue labels depict the main metrics or figures derived from the different analysis steps. For GRE1, PMT3 was a clear outlier and removed from the analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_119_Fig7_HTML" id="d29e1210"/></fig>
</p>
                <p>One analysis was done with the raw data without any signal filtering or normalization (left branch in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Signal changes were quantified on the raw signal as either the signal time derivative (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) or the signal difference between consecutive time points (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For all four PMTs we observed an extreme signal decrease (large negative signal difference and derivative) Heiko Mantzsch and Luca Briganti. We are very thankful for the outstanding upon onset of microgravity. For three out of the four PMTs, the strongest change was found to be the signal decrease upon onset of microgravity. Despite the weaker change in PMT1, the average of the raw signal differences across all four PMTs showed the strongest signal change of all 28â199 calculated signal differences at the time when the g-level changed from 1âg to 0âg (see blue lines in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). A Grubbsâ test was performed to quantify the significance of the observed effect, revealing high evidence for all four individual signal differences as well as for their average (p-valueââªâ0.0001). This test was developed by Grubbs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> to investigate if at âsome time during the experiment something possibly happened to cause an extraneous variation on the high side or on the low sideâ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> and is also nowadays routinely used in regression model checking procedures (i.e. to find outliers in Cookâs d values or standardized residuals). In addition, we determined for each signal difference if it shows a significant deviation from a normal variation around zero (quantified by a test on z-scores given by the differences between each value and the mean divided by the standard deviation) â red points mark significant signal jumps on a significance level of alphaâ=â10<sup>â10</sup>. This Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.1.0 [R Core Team. R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. Vienna, Austria: R Foundation for Statistical Computing; 2014. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>].</p>
                <p>To get a better visualization of the changes occurring during the signal decay upon restoration of gravity, we performed a second data analysis involving some data processing (see right branch in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). In the raw data of all experiments we can easily identify the time of zymosan injection reflecting the initiation of the reaction. The PMT recordings (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>) were thus first synchronized, setting the time of zymosan injection as reference time for all signals. Next, signal intensities across PMTs display significant amplitude variations, which prevent direct comparison across PMTs and experimental conditions. Furthermore, while the downward spike of Run2 can clearly be seen on the temporal derivative or signal difference of the raw signal, noise prevents any clear interpretation of the derivatives for any other parts of the signal. Accordingly, the following signal processing steps were taken for the analysis of the decaying section and overall temporal characteristics: (i) Each PMT signal was first normalized by its peak amplitude; (ii) The normalized signals were filtered using an alternating direction zero-phase filter with kernel size 50, to remove high frequency components without introducing phase distortion; (iii) The time to peak, half time up and down (defined as the time when the signal amplitude reached 50% of its peak value) and time derivatives were computed for each filtered signal. When relevant, data were averaged over the 4 PMTs corresponding to one experimental condition and reported as meanâÂ±âone standard deviation. For GRE1, PMT3 was a clear outlier and removed from the analysis. This signal processing was performed in Matlab 2015 (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).</p>
