                <p>The functional and structural adaptations in cerebral arteries could be one of the fundamental causes in the occurrence of orthostatic intolerance after space flight. In addition, emerging studies have found that many cardiovascular functions exhibit circadian rhythm. Several lines of evidence suggest that space flight might increase an astronaut’s cardiovascular risks by disrupting circadian rhythm. However, it remains unknown whether microgravity disrupts the diurnal variation in vascular contractility and whether microgravity impacts on circadian clock system. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 28-day hindlimb-unweighting to simulate the effects of microgravity on vasculature. Cerebrovascular contractility was estimated by investigating vasoconstrictor responsiveness and myogenic tone. The circadian regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel was determined by recording whole-cell currents, evaluating protein and mRNA expressions. Then the candidate miRNA in relation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was screened. Lastly, the underlying pathway involved in circadian regulation of cerebrovascular contractility was determined. The major findings of this study are: (1) The clock gene BMAL1 could induce the expression of miR-103, and in turn modulate the circadian regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel in rat cerebral arteries at post-transcriptional level; and (2) simulated microgravity disrupted intrinsic diurnal oscillation in rat cerebrovascular contractility by altering circadian regulation of BMAL1/miR-103/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 signal pathway.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Postflight orthostatic intolerance has been considered as one of the major adverse effects after spaceflight, in which multiple mechanisms have been reported to be implicated, such as hypovolemia, altered neurohumoral regulation and aerobic capacity, alterations in baroreflex sensitivity, and cardiovascular dysfunction [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human studies from real microgravity (spaceflight) or simulated microgravity (head-down tilt bed rest) have revealed that impaired autoregulation of cerebral vasculature contributes to the occurrence of postflight orthostatic intolerance. In addition, ground-based animal studies with tail-suspended (SUS) hindlimb-unweighting rat models have clearly demonstrated that simulated microgravity induces the hypertrophic remodeling in cerebral arteries including increased media thickness, augmented myogenic tone, enhanced arterial reactivity, and impaired endothelial function [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. All these findings suggest that functional and structural adaptations in cerebral arteries are fundamental causes in the occurrence of postflight orthostatic intolerance, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully clarified [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Emerging studies have found that many cardiovascular functions exhibit biological circadian rhythm to adapt to Earth’s cycling environment. For example, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac sudden death, and myocardial infarction exists apparent circadian changes with the peaking time in the early morning. In addition, blood pressure, heart rate, vascular contractility, endothelial function, sympathetic nerve activity, and platelet aggregability also display obvious diurnal variation during the course of about a 24-h cycle [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cardiovascular intrinsic timekeeping is driven by a central clock and peripheral tissue clocks. The central clock is located at the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which functions as the master pacemaker by synchronizing the peripheral clocks in accordance with environmental fluctuations [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. At the molecular level, mammalian clocks are composed of autoregulated transcriptional-translational feed-back and feed-forward loops, with a period close to 24-h to drive the gene oscillation. BMAL1 (Brain and muscle aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 1) and CLOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) are two main elements that bind to the promoters of the Period (Per1 and Per2) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2) genes [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Upon accumulation in the cytoplasm, the protein products of Per and Cry translocate to the nucleus and inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated transcription as negative elements, which leads to repression of their own transcription. This core loop is also interconnected with additional positive and negative regulatory loops, including nuclear receptors such as REV-ERBα (NR1D1, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1), RORα (RAR-related orphan receptor alpha), and PPARs (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). These clock genes control numerous target genes (clock-controlled genes, CCGs) and work as transcription factors to produce the diurnal rhythmic expression in approximately 10% of genomic genes, which in turn provide the diurnal variation for cardiovascular function [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>Diurnal variation for cardiovascular function is considered to be mainly attributable to the day/night time variances in vascular contractility [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are major components in the vessel wall, and their contraction is an important physiological process for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis in response to environmental cues. The fundamental pathway for smooth muscle contraction is the increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to CaM (calmodulin) and this complex activates MLCK (myosin light chain kinase), which elicits vascular contraction by phosphorylation of MLC (myosin light chains). A secondary pathway for vascular contraction is the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway by modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitization [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In response to contractile stimuli, the small GTPase RhoA activates its downstream effector Rho kinase, which in turn initiates contraction by inhibition of MLCP (myosin light chain phosphatase). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the expression and activity of ROCK2 (Rho-associated kinase 2) exhibits a diurnal oscillatory with that of MLC phosphorylation and myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitization, which are provoked by the clock gene BMAL1 and RORα in VSMCs [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The L-type (large or long-lasting) voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VDCC, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2) is the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway in VSMCs and then is considered as the primary determinant of VSMC contractility and vascular tone [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether there is an existence of intrinsic circadian regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel for vascular contractility. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-related pathway responsible for vascular diurnal contraction are completely unclear.</p>
              <p>Among the zeitgebers (external time-giving cues), light is the major input into the central clock, which drives and coordinates the internal oscillators in various peripheral tissues through behavioral and neurohumoral transmitters [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, exercise, jetlag, shift work, temperature, feeding, and nutritional signals can also be sensed by clock system and then influence the circadian rhythm. Recently, several lines of evidence from real spaceflight or simulated microgravity studies suggest that gravitational change might be another important cause that influences circadian oscillation [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, the rhythmicity of an astronaut’s body temperature significantly decreased in Russian Mir station flight as compared with that on Earth [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Long-term exposure to microgravity disturbs the astronaut’s autonomic nervous functions and intrinsic cardiovascular functions evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV) [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, human head-down tilt bed rest experiments indicate that simulated microgravity disrupts the diurnal variation in heart rate, blood pressure [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Circadian disruption could increase an astronaut’s cardiovascular risks and cause a decreased ability to effectively and efficiently perform tasks. However, it is not clear whether microgravity could disrupt the diurnal variation in vascular contractility. Furthermore, how the circadian clock is influenced by microgravity, and then generates the altered cardiovascular circadian variation, remains poorly understood.</p>
              <p>The purpose of the present work was (1) to confirm whether simulated microgravity influences the diurnal contractility in rat cerebral arteries; (2) to investigate the circadian regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (the primary determinant of VSMC contractility) in cerebral VSMCs by recording whole-cell currents, evaluating protein and mRNA expressions; and (3) to screen the candidate miRNA (the upstream signaling) in relation with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in VSMCs and then identify the involvement of the BMAL1/miRNA/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 pathway.</p>

However, either the wet weights of the left soleus or the ratio of soleus/body weight significantly decreased in SUS as compared with that in CON rats, which suggested the deconditioning effects of simulated microgravity (<xref rid="ijms-20-03947-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

                <p>Consistent with a previous report in superior mesenteric arteries [<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the contractile responses to 5-HT stimulation in rat middle cerebral arteries were higher at zeitgeber time 4 (ZT4) (the subjective light period) than at ZT16 (the subjective dark period) in CON rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f001">Figure 1</xref>A–C), suggesting that the cerebrovascular contraction displayed a diurnal rhythm with the peak at light phase.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, 5 μM Bay K 8644 (the specific agonist) significantly increased the inward currents, whereas 0.1 μM nifedipine (the specific antagonist) markedly suppressed the inward currents, which obviously indicated the property of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel. The peak current densities at +20 mV showed a circadian oscillation with the peak at ZT4 and the trough at ZT16 in CON rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), which corresponds to the diurnal variation of cerebrovascular contractility in CON as shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f001">Figure 1</xref>).

                <p>To investigate the post-transcriptional regulation, eight miRNAs (miR-328, miR-145, miR-103. miR-137, miR-1, miR-133a, miR-26a, and miR-206) were narrowed to our choices for the candidate miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Only miR-103 expression in cerebral arteries of SUS rats significantly decreased at both ZT4 and ZT16, which corresponds to the markedly increased Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 protein expression at both ZT4 and ZT16 in SUS as compared with that in CON rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Therefore, miR-103 was chosen as a possible negative regulator for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel. Cerebrovascular miR-103 expressions displayed a diurnal rhythm with higher levels during the subjective night, which was nearly anti-phase to the circadian rhythms of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activities and protein expression as observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). Furthermore, Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System was applied to validate whether Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel was the direct down target of miR-103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). The plasmid (WT/MUT/NC) and miR-103 mimic were co-transfected into A7r5 VSMCs. Results show that miRNA-103 mimic only significantly suppressed the relative (hRluc/hLuc) luciferase activity of wild-type (WT) reporter of <italic>CACNA1C</italic> 3′-UTR, but not mutant (MUT) reporter or bland plasmid (plasmid-NC), which provided clear evidence that vascular miR-103 specifically targeted the 3′-UTR of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit. Lastly, gain- and loss-function studies indicated that miR-103 inhibitor significantly increased, whereas miR-103 mimic decreased the protein expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit in cultured VSMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f004">Figure 4</xref>F,G).

                <title>2.7. BMAL1 Induced the Circadian Regulation of miR-103/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 Signal Pathway</title>
                <p>Overexpression and silencing of BMAL1 were used to investigate the functional circadian regulation of miR-103/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in cultured VSMCs. Overexpression of BMAL1 by plasmid vector significantly increased the mRNA levels of miR-103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), while reducing the protein expressions of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f006">Figure 6</xref>B–D). Furthermore, the negative effects of BMAL1 on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit could be abolished by the inhibition of miR-103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f006">Figure 6</xref>B–D). In contrast, silencing of BMAL1 by siRNA markedly decreased the mRNA levels of miR-103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f006">Figure 6</xref>E), whereas it increased the protein expressions of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f006">Figure 6</xref>F–H).

              <p>During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to a microgravity environment which is dramatically different from that on Earth. Previous studies indicate that microgravity induces bone-loss, immune-suppression, cardiovascular dysfunction, and impaired secretion of hormone and neurotransmitter, which suggests that gravity exerts a significant impact on human body [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. When exposed to microgravity, the hydrostatic gradients are lost throughout the vasculature, which induces a cephalad shift in fluid distribution from the lower part of the body towards the upper body [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, the absence of gravitational stimuli during spaceflight induces a number of adaptive changes in the cardiovascular system that may result in the occurrence of postflight orthostatic intolerance [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Microgravity-induced blood volume redistribution has been considered to be the initial trigger to cardiovascular dysfunction, however, which is a complex process involving diverse and complicated mechanisms [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>Recently, evidence has indicated that there might be an integrated signaling network which could sense the microgravity signal and, in turn, modulate the circadian intrinsic timekeeping, including general behavior, hormone synthesis, body temperature, and metabolism [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, simulated microgravity enhanced the amplitude oscillations of BMAL1 clock gene in human keratinocytes with an apparently lower variability of REV-ERBα transcription. In contrast, recovery from simulated microgravity also increased the amplitudes and lengths of BMAL1 and Rev-erbα cycle periods [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. By investigating vasoconstrictor responsiveness and myogenic tone, we found that there was an existence of diurnal variation in rat cerebrovascular contractility with the higher amplitude in the subjective light period(ZT4) and the lower in the subjective dark period(ZT16), which is similar to the previous reports of a circadian rhythm in vascular contractility with a peak at the beginning light phase in nocturnal animals [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, we found that simulated microgravity markedly increased the cerebrovascular contractility at both ZT4 and ZT16, whereas significantly suppressed the intrinsic diurnal variation of rat cerebral vascular contractility. Therefore, microgravity-induced diurnal variation in cerebrovascular contractility may participate in the functional and structural adaptations in cerebral arteries, which causes the occurrence of postflight orthostatic intolerance.</p>
              <p>The L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels mediate a voltage-dependent and depolarization-induced calcium influx, which are composed of a pore-forming α1C-subunit and auxiliary β, α2δ, and γ subunits [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in the retina were reported to be under circadian control with the higher current densities and α1C-subunit expressions at protein and mRNA level during the subjective dark period [<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which play an essential role in the neurotransmitter release from photoreceptors and other retinal neurons. Expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit mRNA in SCN was rhythmic with the peaking during the late night, which was regulated by the clock gene REV-ERBα [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In embryo chick hearts, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents and α1C-subunit expressions at mRNA and protein levels reached the peak at ZT17-20 [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents in mouse cardiomyocytes were larger at ZT3 than that of at ZT15, whereas mRNA and protein expression of α1C-subunit remained constant through the day [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel is highly expressed in VSMCs and is mainly responsible for vascular contraction during excitation-contraction coupling [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The present work found that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in rat cerebral VSMCs have an obvious circadian rhythm, in which the current densities and α1C-subunit protein expression reached the peak at ZT4 and the trough at ZT16. These results are consistent with the diurnal variation in rat cerebrovascular contractility with the higher at ZT4 and the lower at ZT16, as observed. Furthermore, the present work found that simulated microgravity markedly increased the activities and protein expression at both ZT4 and ZT16, whereas significantly attenuated the diurnal variation in rat cerebral arteries. Interestingly, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 mRNA levels either in CON or in SUS remained relatively constant, which suggests that there might be post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 protein expressions. It is noteworthy that the present work showed that there were double bands of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1c-subunit protein expression in cerebral arteries of CON and SUS rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f003">Figure 3</xref>), whereas single bands of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1c-subunit protein expression in cultured VSMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03947-f006">Figure 6</xref>), which correspond to the predicted size of short and long forms of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1c-subunit. We speculate that the double or single band(s) of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1c-subunit may largely depend on the different samples from different sources and preparations.</p>
              <p>Previous studies have shown that both activation of Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-Erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and Ras-PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase)- Akt (protein kinase B) are involved in the circadian output pathways in regulating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, calcineurin, NO/cGMP/PKG signaling, AMPK, mTORC1, and REV-ERBα are also reported to be implicated in the circadian regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in photoreceptor physiology [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition to the classic gene regulation, recent studies indicate that miRNAs might play an essential role in the modulation of timekeeping at the post-transcriptional level [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. MicroRNAs are a group of small, non-coding, single-stranded RNA and exhibit specific temporal and spatial expression following environmental stimulation. Mature miRNAs could induce one or more downstream target genes’ destabilization and/or translational repression at the post-transcriptional level by biding to 3′-UTR [<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It has been reported that the expression of miR-219 and miR-132 in SCN shows an oscillatory pattern and antagonism of these miRNAs alters the length of circadian period and light-induced resetting of the clock in mice. Inhibition of miR-122 in liver induces post-transcriptional perturbations in the circadian regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. In the present study, we confirmed that miR-103 exhibited an apparent circadian rhythm in rat cerebral arteries, which was in the opposite circadian phase of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 protein expression. In addition, simulated microgravity significantly reduced miR-103 expression at both ZT4 and ZT16 in rat cerebral arteries. By vitro targeting reporter assays and gain/loss-function studies, we demonstrated that as a key post-transcriptional regulator, vascular miR-103 directly targeted Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 α1C-subunit and then negatively modulated Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 activities and protein expression in a circadian manner.</p>
              <p>It has been reported that deletion or mutation of clock gene disrupts cardiovascular circadian rhythms accompanied by dilated cardiomyopathy, arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, impaired cholesterol metabolism, and increased development of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, global deletion of BMAL1 in mice abolished the circadian blood pressure associated with the hypotension. BMAL1 deletion in endothelial cells or VSMCs compromised the diurnal variation of blood pressure. In addition, the mice with deletion of BMAL1 in the heart were more susceptible to arrhythmia and prolonged RR and QRS intervals [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, cardiovascular diseases may also affect clock gene expression. High salt diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy was associated with attenuated rhythmic expression of core clock genes in rats [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In a type 2 diabetic rat model, cardiac clock genes exhibited a phase shift with a 3-h delay [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The present study demonstrated that simulated microgravity not only altered the expression of BMAL1, but also attenuated the diurnal variations in both central clock of SCN and peripheral clock of cerebral arteries. Furthermore, BMAL1 was found to induce miR-103 expression in VSMCs, which in turn modulated the protein expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel at the post-transcriptional level. These results validate the signal pathway of BMAL1/miR-103/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 was involved in simulating microgravity-induced circadian dysfunction of cerebrovascular contractility. Actually, we have also investigated other clock gene expression at protein and mRNA levels in cerebral arteries isolated from control and simulated microgravity rats, such as Per2 and dbp (data were not shown). However, we could not get enough evidence to demonstrate the relationships of Per2/dbp and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel in simulated microgravity rats at now.</p>
              <p>The occurrence of postflight orthostatic intolerance has been regarded as a major adverse effect and there are still no effective countermeasures until now. Better understanding of the role of circadian regulation in cerebrovascular adaptation will lead to new chronotherapeutic countermeasures during microgravity exposure. In addition, we also want to provide novel theoretical knowledge to understand the relationships between microRNAs and the circadian timing systems. We found that simulated microgravity altered the clock gene BMAL1 in the central clock of SCN and the peripheral clock of cerebral arteries. Therefore, it is suggested that BMAL1-induced miR-103 could be a communicated link between the core clock and peripheral vascular clock output signaling that further governs biological functions which need further research. In summary, our present studies provide compelling evidence that (1) the clock gene BMAL1 could induce the expression of miR-103 and in turn modulate the circadian regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel in rat cerebral arteries at post-transcriptional level; and (2) simulated microgravity disrupts intrinsic diurnal oscillation in rat cerebrovascular contractility by altering circadian regulation of BMAL1/miR-103/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 signal pathway. Our work provides a novel mechanism underlying the circadian dysfunction in cerebrovascular contractility when exposed to microgravity.</p>

The experimental simulated microgravity rat model was successfully established by using modified suspension techniques from our laboratory as described previously [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in which rats were maintained in about –30° head-down tilt position with their hindlimbs unloaded to simulate the cardiovascular deconditioning effects of microgravity. All animals received standard rat chow and water ad libitum. At the end of a 28-day simulation period, animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p.) and killed by exsanguination via the abdominal aorta. The wet weight of the left soleus was measured to confirm the efficacy of deconditioning. All the samples were collected under normal LD cycles. All procedures complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with IACUC approval at the Fourth Military Medical University. Table of Animal Experimental Ethical Inspection was submitted on 5th September 2015 and approved with the NO. 20150911 by Experimental Animal Ethics and Welfare Committee of Fourth Military Medical University. </p>

                <title>4.2. Examination of Vasoconstrictor Responsiveness</title>
                <p>To determine the vascular contraction in response to constrictor stimulation, middle cerebral arteries were isolated from CON and SUS rats at zeitgeber time 4 (ZT4) and ZT16. As previously described [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the segment of middle cerebral artery was transferred to the PSS containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.5 glucose, and 0.026 EDTA, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. To focus on studying VSMC function, the endothelial layer was mechanically removed by the injection of air bubbles and then cannulated by two pipettes with nylon suture in a vessel chamber. After cannulation, the chamber was transferred to the Pressure Myograph System P110 (DMT, Aarhus, Denmark) and the arterial segment was perfused under a pressure of 25 mmHg for 5–10 min to check the leaking and then remove the blood residue. The arterial segment was allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C and 50 mmHg for 1 h. After equilibration, the arterial viability was evaluated by its reactivity to 20 and 60 mM isotonic KCl. Then the pressure was cycled three times between 25 and 125 mmHg to reduce mechanical hysteresis. Concentration-response relationships were determined by the cumulative superfusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10<sup>−10</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup> M) while the arteries were pressurized at 50 mmHg in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-contained PSS. Contractile response to cumulative superfusion of 5-HT was represented as the percentage of luminal diameter relative to the baseline internal diameter according to the formula: Luminal diameter change (%) = (Di,a,s − Di,a,b)/Di,a,b. × 100 %, where Di,a,b was the baseline internal diameter measured in active state at a pressure of 50 mmHg and Di,a,s was the steady-state internal diameter measured to each subsequent change in agonist concentration at the same pressure.</p>

                <p>To determine the vascular contraction in response to mechanical stretch, the myogenic responses were investigated in middle cerebral arteries isolated from SUS and CON rats at ZT4 and ZT16. Intraluminal pressure was increased from 0 to 150 mmHg by increments of 25 mmHg [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each step was maintained for 5–10 min to allow the vessel to reach a steady-state diameter. When vasomotion was present, the steady-state mean diameter was calculated. Finally, a passive pressure-diameter relationship was achieved by incubating the arterioles with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS containing 2 mM EGTA and sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.01 mM) for 30 min and repeated. The myogenic tone was calculated as: Myogenic tone (%) = (Di,p − Di,a)/Di,p × 100%, where Di,p was the passive internal diameter determined in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS containing 2 mM EGTA and Di,a was the active internal diameter determined in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-contained PSS at a particular intraluminal pressure.</p>

Following, the segments were transferred to enzyme-free PSS containing 1 mg/mL BSA and 5 mM taurine at room temperature for 10 min and triturated with a flame-polished pipette to disperse VSMCs.

                <p>Currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in isolated cerebral VSMCs, with an amplifier (CEZ-2300, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and a version interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA), as described previously [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-03947" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Command-voltage protocols and data acquisition were performed with pCLAMP software (version 8.0, Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes (tip resistance 2–6 MΩ when filled with a pipette solution) were fabricated on an electrode puller (Narishige Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) with borosilicate glass capillary tubing. Cell capacitance (Cm) and access resistance were estimated from the capacitive current transient evoked by application of a 20-mV pulse for 40 ms from a holding potential of −60 to −40 mV. To account for differences in cell size, currents were normalized to Cm to obtain the current densities. All measurements were performed at room temperature (25 °C). The cell was held at −40mV and then stepped in 10 mV increments from −40 to +70 mV. Voltage steps were 250 ms in duration, and 2 s intervals were allowed between steps. Currents were filtered at 0.5 kHz and digitized at 4 kHz. Nonspecific membrane leakage and residual capacitive currents were subtracted with the p/4 protocol. Ba<sup>2+</sup> replaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> as charge carrier to increase unitary currents and to minimize Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent run-down. To obtain the I-V curve of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, the current densities were plotted against the corresponding command potentials. Two kinds of external solutions, solutions A and B, were used. Solution A was used while making a gigaohm seal between the recording pipette and cell surface. It contained (in mM) 120 NaCl, 30 Mannitol, 3 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 30 HEPES, and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% glucose at pH 7.4 titrated with NaOH. After a seal of 2 GΩ was obtained, the perfusion fluid was changed to solution B during current recording. Solution B contained (in mM) 108 BaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, pH corrected to 7.6 with BaOH<sub>2</sub>. Cs<sup>+</sup> was used in the pipette solution to minimize outward K<sup>+</sup> current. The pipette contained (in mM) 150 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 D-glucose at pH 7.2 titrated with CsOH. To identify the properties of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, extracellular application of 0.1 μM nifedipine (the specific blocker) and 5 μM Bay K 8644 (the specific agonist) were used in this study.</p>

                <p>Diurnal rhythm of vasoconstrictor responsiveness to 5-HT and myogenic tone in middle cerebral arteries isolated from CON and SUS rats. The concentration-response curves were determined by the cumulative superfusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10<sup>−10</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup> M) in middle cerebral arteries isolated from CON and SUS rats at ZT4 (<bold>A</bold>) and ZT16 (<bold>B</bold>), respectively. The contractile responses in response to 10<sup>−6</sup> M 5-HT were markedly increased at both ZT4 and ZT16 in SUS rats as compared with that in CON rats (<bold>C</bold>). The diurnal variation in vasoconstrictor responsiveness (the difference value between ZT4 and ZT16 level) significantly decreased in SUS rats as compared with that in CON rats (<bold>D</bold>). The myogenic tone of middle cerebral arteries isolated from CON and SUS rats was calculated when intraluminal pressure ranging from 4 to 150 mmHg at ZT4 (<bold>E</bold>) and ZT16 (<bold>F</bold>), respectively. The myogenic tone markedly increased at both ZT4 and ZT16 in SUS rats as compared with that in CON rats when intraluminal pressure was 125 mmHg (<bold>G</bold>). The diurnal variation in myogenic tone (the difference value between ZT4 and ZT16 level) significantly decreased in SUS rats as compared with that in CON rats (<bold>H</bold>).
