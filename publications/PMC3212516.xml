              <abstract>
                <p>The skin is susceptible to different injuries and diseases. One major obstacle in skin tissue engineering is how to develop functional three-dimensional (3D) substitute for damaged skin. Previous studies have proved a 3D dynamic simulated microgravity (SMG) culture system as a “stimulatory” environment for the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Here, we employed the NASA-approved rotary bioreactor to investigate the proliferation and differentiation of human epidermal stem cells (hEpSCs). hEpSCs were isolated from children foreskins and enriched by collecting epidermal stem cell colonies. Cytodex-3 micro-carriers and hEpSCs were co-cultured in the rotary bioreactor and 6-well dish for 15 days. The result showed that hEpSCs cultured in rotary bioreactor exhibited enhanced proliferation and viability surpassing those cultured in static conditions. Additionally, immunostaining analysis confirmed higher percentage of ki67 positive cells in rotary bioreactor compared with the static culture. In contrast, comparing with static culture, cells in the rotary bioreactor displayed a low expression of involucrin at day 10. Histological analysis revealed that cells cultured in rotary bioreactor aggregated on the micro-carriers and formed multilayer 3D epidermis structures. In conclusion, our research suggests that NASA-approved rotary bioreactor can support the proliferation of hEpSCs and provide a strategy to form multilayer epidermis structure.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Skin is one of the major organs of the body and considered as the primary protective barrier against the external environment. Adult skin is composed of two tissue layers: the stratified epidermis and the thick layer of collagen-rich dermal connective tissue. The epidermis, consisting of keratinocytes with variable degrees of differentiation,is constantly maintained by the population of self-renewing epidermal stem cell <xref rid="pone.0026603-Blanpain1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In addition, epidermal stem cells are deeply involved in tissue regeneration, wound healing, and neoplasm formation <xref rid="pone.0026603-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Watt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p>
              <p>The skin is susceptible to different injuries and diseases. Much attention has been given to patients with large-scale skin injuries such as severe burn or scald <xref rid="pone.0026603-Gallico1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Tissue-engineered skin has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in USA for use in wound healing, but the clinical results are far from satisfaction <xref rid="pone.0026603-Meuli1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The application of this technique or method in therapy is presumably limited by the cultured epidermal and dermal autografts <xref rid="pone.0026603-Bello1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Charruyer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Therefore, it is critical to improve the approaches to the isolation and culture of epidermal stem cells for their clinical utilization. Meanwhile, it remains a challenge for clinical application to improve the effect of wound healing and create a physiological three-dimensional (3D) tissue skin structure using EpSCs <italic>in-vitro</italic> before implantation.</p>
              <p>Several studies showed that rotary bioreactor as a tool could influence major cellular events such as differentiation, proliferation, viability and cell cycle <xref rid="pone.0026603-Unsworth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Recent studies have shown that rotation culture promotes the proliferation and viability of human periodontal ligament stem cells <xref rid="pone.0026603-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and human mesenchymal stem cells <xref rid="pone.0026603-Yuge1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Biomechanical force plays an important role to promote embryonic hematopoiesis <xref rid="pone.0026603-Adamo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Also some studies indicated that 3D clinostat for cell culture suppresses the differentiation of human osteoblast cells <xref rid="pone.0026603-Yuge2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, human hematopoietic progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0026603-Plett1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and rat myoblasts <xref rid="pone.0026603-Hirasaka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. More recently, simulative microgravity culture conditions were successfully used to culture mouse embryonic stem cells in feeder-free, serum-free media and LIF (Leukemia inhibitory factor) -free systems, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Kawahara1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and to maintain the undifferentiated state and enhance the neural repair potential of bone marrow stromal cells <xref rid="pone.0026603-Yuge3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We hypothesize that rotation cell culture system is also a feasible way to study human epidermal stem cells (hEpSCs) on the aspect of proliferation and differentiation. But to date, there are few related reports about this aspect.</p>
              <p>Rotating cell culture system (RCCS) is a cell culture device made by NASA to simulate microgravity condition. It is also a 3D dynamic culture system for cell growth <xref rid="pone.0026603-Facer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. This culture system seems to be ideal for overcoming some drawbacks of static culture, because the rotational motion can prevent sedimentation, and create a suspension culture environment and enhance cell-cell interactions. Several researches showed that RCCS contribute to cellular aggregation, intercellular adhesion and formation of 3D cell clumps <xref rid="pone.0026603-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In this study, we enriched hEpSCs from 1–5 year old children foreskins according to cell size and collagen type IV adhesiveness method established in our group <xref rid="pone.0026603-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Isolated hEpSCs were expanded as previously described <xref rid="pone.0026603-Rheinwald1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and expanded cells were seeded on cytodex 3 micro-carriers and cultured in RCCS for 15 days. The proliferation and differentiation of cells were investigated under the same conditions. We found that rotary bioreactor enhances the proliferation and viability of hEpSCs in the first 10 days. In addition, rotation culture extenuates the differentiated state of hEpSCs compare with static culture. Furthermore, hEpSCs cultured in RCCS inclined to aggregate on the micro-carriers and form multilayer 3D epidermis-like structures. Our data suggest that NASA-approved rotary bioreactor may provide ideal approaches to creating a 3D epidermis tissue.</p>

No significant differences of the expression level for β1-integrin, p63 or K14 were found between the isolated primary hEpSCs and the colony cells passageed three times from initial hEpSCs, and the majority of expanded hEpSCs were positive for these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g002">Fig.2A</xref>).

                <p>To examine the effect of rotary culture on the growth of hEpSCs, colony cells were trypsinized, and seeded in rotary bioreactor together with micro-carrier beads for 1 day, which allowed cells to attach to the surface of the beads.

The cells in rotary bioreactor were prone to accumulate on the micro-carrier beads, and cluster of cells or 3D aggregates were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g004">Fig. 4A, right panel</xref>), while cells in 6-well cell culture plate appeared monolayer sheet structure on the surface of micro-carrier beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, middle panel). In rotation culture group, there were a large number of cells aggregated over micro-carriers beads forming 3D tissue-like epidermis structure.

                <title>Promotion of proliferation and inhibition of differentiation in three-dimensional cell culture of RCCS</title>
                <p>The effect of rotation culture on proliferation of hEpSCs was investigated through MTS assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>, rotation culture condition remarkably promoted the cell proliferation potential in culture at day 5 and 10 compared with that in static culture condition.

Ki67 is a marker of proliferation <xref rid="pone.0026603-Gerdes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and involucrin is a marker of terminal differentiation of hEpSCs <xref rid="pone.0026603-Watt2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Results showed that the differences for percentage of ki67 positive cells were statistically significant between rotation culture and static culture in the culture for 10 days (t test, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). The percentage of ki67 positive cells per aggregate was about 10% under rotation culture condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g005">Fig.5C</xref>). On the contrast, for static culture group, there was very low percentage of ki67 positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g005">Fig.5C</xref>), suggesting that rotation culture seemingly support the proliferation of hEpSCs under a feeder free culture condition. Conversely, we compared the expression of involucrin in rotation culture with that in static culture at protein level. These results showed that the expression of involucrin in rotation culture was significantly lower than that in static culture on day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g006">Fig.6A</xref>). However, we did not observe visible variation of the involucrin expression in cells of cultured at day 1. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026603-g006">Fig.6A, B</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Clinical applications of tissue-engineered skin substitute represent a strategy for wound healing <xref rid="pone.0026603-Griffith1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and presently cultured autografts are still considered to be the preferred candidate for wound healing. Currently, two major questions are confronted in wound repair and skin regeneration research: one is to isolate and propagate epidermal stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic>; the other is to create a physiological 3D tissue structure <italic>in vitro</italic> before transplantation <xref rid="pone.0026603-Li4" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, there are still many technical challenges to be overcome to attain a highly efficient isolation/enrichment of hEpSCs and the ability of culturing the cells to be a natural 3D structure <xref rid="pone.0026603-Griffith1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Firstly, we have described a procedure for the isolation and culture of hEpSCs derived from human foreskin using a previously described method with modifications. In our system, epidermal stem cells isolated from the human foreskin could be successfully propagated in vitro, maintaining hEpSCs marker and supporting highly proliferative capacity.</p>
              <p>Secondly, studies were carried out with a NASA rotary bioreactor to investigate the effect of rotational culture on proliferation of hEpSCs. Interestingly, we found that rotational culture seemed to offer several advantages for hEpSCs growth, particularly for the generation of 3D epidermal aggregates under feeder-free culture condition. According to the results of MTS assay, hEpSCs in RCCS proliferated at day 5 and 10 of culture, while cells in static culture condition exhibited insignificant changes on the surface of micro-carriers. Moreover, the measurement of Ki67, a commendable marker of proliferation, was included in our experiment. The measurement indicated that Ki67 positive cells could be observed by day 10 of culture in the RCCS. However, almost no Ki67 positive cells were observed by day 10 of static culture in the 6-well plate. These results indicated that the rotation culture conditions produced by RCCS were superior to static culture for hEpSCs under feeder-free culture condition. Interestingly, similar results were observed for human periodontal ligament stem cells, osteoblast like cells and rat marrow stromal cells after culture in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor <xref rid="pone.0026603-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Rucci1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Further, to explore the mechanism of hEpSC proliferation and 3D structure formation under rotational culture condition. The effect of cell differentiation was considered chiefly. Involucrin, a known maker for terminal differentiation of keratinocytes <xref rid="pone.0026603-Egberts1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, was examined in this study. Based on our western blot results, by day 10 of culture, weak expression of involucrin was detected in cells cultured under RCCS, whereas strong expression of involucrin was detected in cells cultured under static culture conditions. Our results suggest that RCCS could potentially provide a favorable environment to inhibit the differentiation of hEpSCs. This is consistent with previous findings in which the rotating wall vessel bioreactor has been shown to provide a culture platform for the repression of terminal differentiation in many cell types <xref rid="pone.0026603-Hammond1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Navran1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
              <p>In our culture system, cytodex 3, prepared with a cover of a thin layer of denatured collagen chemically coupled to a matrix of cross-linked dextran, was used in this study. Previous studies have indicated that cytodex 3 could support the growth of a wide variety of cells <xref rid="pone.0026603-Qiu2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0026603-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Importantly, compared with other culture methods, cytodex 3 provides the possibility for the quick expansion of cells on the large surface of spherical carriers thereby avoiding further enzymatic treatment before transplantation <xref rid="pone.0026603-Voigt1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, we suggested that the rotating speed of RCCS should be adjusted at a low level of about 12 rpm on the first day, because under these conditions the visible cells and cytodex 3 aggregates formed a fluid orbit within the vessel, exhibitting continual free fall, and did not make contact with the wall of the vessel, resulting in an increase in the number of cells attached to the micro-carriers. On the second day, the rotating speed was increased to 22 rpm and held constant during the additional 14 days of culture.</p>
              <p>The fundamental process for the creation of a 3D epidermis is cellular proliferation and differentiation to obtain a stratified, squamous epithelium. Epidermal differentiation is a common process for keratinocytes during the formation of the mature epidermis tissue, and some terminal differentiation markers appear in the cells at the middle or later stages of differentiation <xref rid="pone.0026603-Eckert1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Our studies showed that the expression of involucrin was significantly lower in cells of the RCCS group than that of the static culture group on day 10 of culture. So, our data suggest that a rotational 3D culture may provide a beneficial environment for epidermis development, as the keratinocytes can interact with each other in a microenvironment that allows differentiation to proceed in a similar pattern to skin development <italic>in vivo</italic>. This viewpoint was also suggested by Lewis and Duray, who discovered that tissues could be cultured in rotating wall vessel bioreactor as for organ culture and maintain their overall structure comparable to the original explants <xref rid="pone.0026603-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026603-Duray1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p>
              <p>To summarize, our results demonstrate that RCCS may provide an ideal physical and chemical environment to guide hEpSCs proliferation and provides an acceptable culture model to assemble 3D multilayer epidermis tissue. Moreover, this dynamic system may have a putative value as screening tool of skin drug research in the future.</p>

                <p>For culture, 5×10<sup>3</sup> cells/ml EpSCs and 1 mg/ml micro-carriers were inoculated to 10 ml culture vessel of RCCS (Synthecon, Inc., Houston, TX, U.S.A) with 10 ml FAD complete culture media. The vessel was installed onto the RCCS rotating in a clockwise direction at a speed of 12 rpm in the first day. After cells adhered to the micro-carries 24 later, they were randomly allocated to the two groups, the static culture group and the RCCS group. In RCCS group, cells were seeded in vessel of RCCS and the rotational speed was then changed to 22 rpm until the end of 15 days culture. In static culture group, cells were cultured in 6-well plates. The medium was changed every 5 days and the cells were observed at that times.</p>
