                <p>The molecular mechanism for the microgravity‐induced decrease in bone formation remains unclear and there is a lack of effective specific preventative therapies. We recently reported that primary cilia of osteoblasts became shorter and even disappeared when the cells were exposed to random positioning machine (RPM)‐simulated microgravity and that the microgravity‐induced loss of osteogenic potential of osteoblasts could be attenuated when the resorption of primary cilia was prevented by treatment with 0.1 μM cytochalasin D. In the current study, it was further found that the loss of the osteogenic capacity of rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) was associated with the inhibition of the BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway, of which most of the signalling proteins including BMP‐2, BMPRII, Smad1/5/8 and p‐Smad1/5/8 were found localized to primary cilia. Accompanying the resorption of primary cilia following the cells being exposed to simulated microgravity, the expression levels of these signalling proteins were reduced significantly. Furthermore, the expression of miRNA‐129‐3p, a microRNA previously reported to control cilium biogenesis, was found to be reduced quickly and changed in a similar tendency with the length of primary cilia. Moreover, overexpression of miRNA‐129‐3p in ROBs significantly attenuated microgravity‐induced inhibition of BMP‐2 signalling and loss of osteogenic differentiation and mineralization. These results indicated the important role of miRNA‐129‐3p in microgravity‐induced resorption of primary cilia of osteoblasts and the potential of replenishing the miRNA‐129‐3p as an effective countermeasure against microgravity‐induced loss of primary cilia and impairment of osteoblast function.</p>

              <p>Despite the rapid development in space exploration and the space industry, there are still many associated health problems of astronauts and cosmonauts waiting to be resolved before the space travel dream can be realized. Gravitational unloading due to microgravity has brought many negative effects on the body, including bone and muscle loss, cardiovascular dysfunction, malfunction in the nervous system and impaired immune function.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Bone is very sensitive to mechanical stimulation<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and microgravity in space causes a reduction in the mass of load‐bearing bone, which is difficult to recover after the astronauts return to earth.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> It was reported that 92% of the crew members of the Mir Space Station and the International Space Station (ISS) experienced a minimum 5% loss in at least one skeletal site and over 40% experienced a 10% or greater loss in at least one skeletal site.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Bone loss of astronauts exposed to a long‐term space mission was reported to be about 10‐fold greater than that observed in postmenopausal women on earth.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> This significant change can affect the performance and safety of crew members during extravehicular activities and put them at a higher risk of fragility fractures.</p>
              <p>Bone loss in space or analogue environment on earth has been considered to be the result of microgravity‐induced impairment of osteoblast function and the subsequent upregulation of osteoclast‐mediated bone resorption.

              <p>The primary cilium is a microtubule‐based structure protruding from the cell surface like an antenna on most mammalian cells.

</p>
              <p>In the current study, BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 signalling was found to be closely connected with primary cilia of osteoblasts and its activity was inhibited simultaneously with the microgravity‐induced shortening/absorption of primary cilia. The overexpression of miRNA‐129‐3p, a microRNA reported to promote cilium biogenesis, had the ability to counteract the adverse effects of microgravity on primary cilia and BMP‐2 signalling pathway as well as the osteogenic capacity of osteoblasts.</p>

                <p>Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the calvarias of newborn SD rats as reported previously.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Briefly, neonatal rats (within 24 h) were obtained from the Animal Breeding Center, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Lanzhou, China). Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the 940th Hospital of Joint Logistics Support Force of PLA and were conducted according to NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The calvarias were dissected aseptically, cleaned of adhering soft tissues, cut into small pieces, digested twice at 37°C with 0.25% trypsin, 10 min each time, and then digested five times at 37°C with 1 mg/ml collagenase II, 15 min each time. The released cells from the last three digestions were pooled in α‐MEM culture medium and filtered through a 75 μm cell sieve. The collected cells were resuspended in α‐MEM plus 10% heat‐inactivated FBS and plated in a 100‐mm dish at a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After reaching confluence, the cells were subcultured in 50‐ml flasks. The first to the third passages of osteoblasts were used in the following experiments.</p>

The culture flasks mounted at the centre of RPM experienced a state of simulated microgravity (SMG). The RPM was placed in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and connected to the control console outside of the incubator. ROBs in the normal ground (NG) group were seeded in flasks filled with the same culture medium but statically placed in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator without an RPM.

Immunofluorescent staining was carried out overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies against acetylated α‐tubulin, γ‐tubulin, BMP‐2, BMP receptors (BMPRII, BMPRIA and BMPRIB), Smad1/5/8 or phosphorylated (p)‐Smad1/5/8 (1:500, all from Abcam). After washes, the cells were probed with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 594 or Alexa 488 (1:1000; Abcam) for 1 h at 37°C. Cellular nuclear DNA was stained with 4′‐6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI) (1:800; Solarbio). The cells were imaged under Delta Vision Imaging System (Delta Vision Ultra; Cytiva). The lengths of primary cilia were measured with Image‐Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics). The average length of each group was calculated from at least 40 primary cilia (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 40). The percentage of ciliated cells was obtained by counting the number of ciliated cells and the total number of cells in 10 different fields of view.</p>

                <p>To investigate the effect of microgravity on osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization, osteoblasts grown to near confluence were treated by RPM for different periods, and then analysed for expression of COL‐1, OSX and RUNX‐2, the critical markers for osteogenic differentiation.

                <p>To explore mechanisms for the decreased osteogenic potential of ROBs after RPM treatment, we investigated changes in the BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway, a key pathway involved in osteoblastic differentiation. For this, the expression of proteins related to the pathway was examined by Western blotting in a time course, including BMP‐2, BMPRII, BMPRIA, BMPRIB, Smad1/ and p‐Smad1/5/8. Among these proteins, while only BMPRIA and Smad1/5/8 were kept constant in levels after different periods of RPM treatment, the other proteins all decreased significantly after 4 h (BMPRII) or 6 h (BMP‐2), and further decreased to a very low level after 12 h (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C–E</xref>), which were consistent with the changes in osteogenesis markers described above although they began to decrease earlier after RPM treatment.

To verify this speculation, we firstly examined whether one or more signalling proteins of the pathway were localized to primary cilia in the normal gravity condition. Surprisingly, it was found that immunofluorescence staining of BMP‐2, BMPRII, p‐Smad1/5/8 or Smad1/5/8 overlapped with primary cilia (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), in 84%, 90%, 93% and 85% of ROBs (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), respectively, indicating that these proteins were localized at the entire structure of a primary cilium. In addition, these proteins were all those whose expression levels were found to be decreased significantly after RPM treatment (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1C–E</xref>). BMPRIA was not localized to primary cilia and its expression level was kept constant during RPM treatment. While BMPRIB was not localized to primary cilia either, its expression levels decreased significantly after RPM treatment.</p>

                <p>The above results demonstrated a potentially close relationship between primary cilia and the BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. To explore the possibility that the decreased activation of the BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 pathway was caused by defects of primary cilia, the primary cilia of ROBs were abrogated by silencing the expression of IFT88, a gene required for ciliogenesis. As shown in Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3A–D</xref>, primary cilia of ROBs were shorter and even became dotted after 24 h of transfection with shRNA against IFT88. We then examined the treatment effects on the BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 pathway. While treatment with exogenous human recombinant BMP‐2 at 500 ng/ml significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of BMP‐2 and BMPRII in the normal control cells (shNC + BMP‐2), this increasing effect did not occur in the cells with abrogated primary cilia (shRNA + BMP‐2) (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3E,F</xref>). While the expression levels of BMP‐2, BMPRII and p‐Smad1/5/8 were increased significantly in the shNC + BMP‐2 group compared with the shNC group, the expression levels of these proteins were not increased in the shRNA + BMP‐2 group and kept at similar levels with the shNC group (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3G,H</xref>). Furthermore, the CFU‐F‐ALP colonies formed after 9 days (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3I,K</xref>) and the calcified nodules formed after 12 days (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3J,L</xref>) displayed similar tendencies among the three treatment groups. These results indicated that there is a close relationship between the primary cilia and the BMP‐2/Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway and that the pathway cannot be activated in osteoblasts without primary cilia.</p>

                <p>To observe the effect of microgravity on the primary cilia of osteoblasts, ROBs were exposed to the RPM‐induced microgravity for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h, respectively, and were observed under the Delta Vision Imaging System after immunofluorescence staining with acetylated α‐tubulin and γ‐tubulin. It was found that the length of primary cilia and the number of the cells with primary cilia decreased quickly and depending upon the duration of microgravity exposure (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The average length of primary cilia was originally 3.2 μm (0 h), decreased by half after 4 h and became shorter than 1 μm after 6 h (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). After 12 h, most primary cilia (stained green by acetylated α‐tubulin) disappeared, and only the basal body (stained red by γ‐tubulin) could be seen. The basal body also became smaller and dimer gradually (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Meanwhile, the proportion of cells with primary cilia changed in a similar tendency, which was 90% originally but decreased to 10% after 12 h (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). These changes coincided with the decreases in protein expression levels of acetylated α‐tubulin and γ‐tubulin as revealed by Western blotting analyses (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4D,E</xref>). However, the protein expression levels of α‐tubulin and GAPDH kept constant throughout the treatment periods, demonstrating that the above changes induced by microgravity were specific and not lethal to the cells. The above‐described changes did not happen in the control cells without RPM treatment.</p>

                <p>Since the overexpression of miRNA‐129‐3p in ROBs prevented RPM‐induced abrogation of primary cilia, we wondered whether it could retain the osteogenic potential of osteoblasts as well as cytochalasin D (a positive control) in simulated microgravity.

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p>Many studies have demonstrated that living in microgravity results in reduced bone formation due to impairments in osteoblastic formation and function,<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> for which the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Since Russian investigators found reductions in some blood antioxidants and an increase in lipid peroxidation in humans after long‐term space flights, oxidative stress has been proposed to be one of the reasons for microgravity‐induced bone loss, which led to the recommendation for adequate intake of antioxidants that had been proved to be only partially effective.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> In 2017, we reported that the decreased osteogenesis of osteoblasts in simulated microgravity was accompanied by the shortening/resorption of primary cilia.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> The current study has further found that the microgravity‐induced loss of osteoblast function and shortening of primary cilia were related to the decreased activity of BMP2 signalling, and that the overexpression of miRNA‐129‐3p, a microRNA found downregulated in microgravity‐treated osteoblasts, could counteract the adverse effect of microgravity on primary cilia and the osteogenic capacity of osteoblasts.</p>
              <p>Due to the critical roles of BMPs in skeletal development, bone formation and bone repair,<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> some studies have focused on changes in BMP signalling in microgravity and on its potential use as a therapeutic means.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Cao et al. demonstrated the declined expression of BMPs and transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β) in all regions of the hind‐limb bones of rats with tail suspension for 21 days.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> Another study showed that BMP‐2 lost its ability to stimulate the osteogenic differentiation of ROS17/2.8 cells under simulated weightlessness.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Qian et al. reported that interval intramuscular injection of BMP2 alone in hindlimb‐unloaded rats could increase the osteogenic potential of bone marrow‐derived stromal cells and the expression levels of osteogenic marker genes.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Despite the above studies, the detailed mechanism for microgravity‐induced decreased activity of BMP signalling is still unknown.</p>
              <p>We were the first group to report that the primary cilia of osteoblasts became shorter quickly after exposure to RPM‐simulated microgravity, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in osteogenic differentiation and mineralization.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> We speculated that primary cilia may be a microgravity sensor of osteoblasts and that keeping the normal structure and function of primary cilia should be a potential way to prevent the loss of osteoblast function induced by microgravity. Supporting this, cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization was found to prevent microgravity‐induced loss of osteogenic capacity of osteoblasts by protecting primary cilia.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>, <xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In the current study, it was further found that microgravity‐induced shortening/resorption of primary cilia was accompanied by the significant reduction in the expression levels of signalling proteins of the BMP‐2/Smad15/8 signalling pathway including BMP2, BMPRII, BMPRIB and p‐Smad1/5/8 (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), indicating the inhibited status of BMP2 signalling pathway. Moreover, it was found that BMP2, BMPRII, Smad1/5/8 and p‐Smad1/5/8 were all found to be localized to the primary cilia of osteoblasts, and exogenous recombinant BMP2 lost its ability to stimulate the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of the osteoblasts that had the primary cilia being abrogated by silencing the expression of IFT88. These results suggest the following sequence of events in the pathophysiological process of microgravity‐induced osteogenesis defect: the primary cilia of osteoblasts are firstly resorbed due to microgravity, and activation of the BMP2/Smad15/8 signalling pathway (and perhaps other pathways) is then inhibited, which in turn results in the impairment of osteogenic potential of osteoblasts. This process can suggest that the protection of primary cilia should be the primary means to prevent the microgravity‐induced impairment of osteoblasts.</p>
              <p>miRNA‐129‐3p is a microRNA conserved in vertebrates that was found to be able to control cellular cilium biogenesis by downregulating centrosomal protein (CP110) and concomitantly repressing the formation of branched F‐actin.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> The serum starvation‐induced ciliogenesis in RPE1 cells has been attributed to the increased expression of miRNA‐129‐3p.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Inspired by this report, we examined the expression levels of miRNA‐129‐3p in the ROBs exposed to simulated microgravity in a time course. Surprisingly, it was found that the changing tendency of miRNA‐129‐3p expression was very similar to those of the length and incidence of primary cilia in treated ROBs (Figures <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This result, together with the simultaneous increase in miRNA‐129‐3p expression in the cells treated by cytochalasin D, demonstrated that the reduction in miRNA‐129‐3p expression could be the main reason for microgravity‐induced resorption of primary cilia.</p>
              <p>To further verify the role of miRNA‐129‐3p in microgravity‐induced resorption of primary cilia and to explore its potential therapeutic effect, we next performed a simulated microgravity experiment with ROBs with miRNA‐129‐3p overexpression (transfected with a plasmid containing miRNA‐129‐3p). Compared with the control group, in the group with miRNA‐129‐3p overexpression, microgravity‐induced reductions in the length and incidence of primary cilia were both significantly attenuated, and the impaired osteogenic differentiation as well as the inhibited activity of the BMP‐2/Smad15/8 signalling pathway were also almost rescued completely (Figures <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Furthermore, this protective effect of miRNA‐129‐3p overexpression did not occur in the osteoblasts in which primary cilia had been removed by chloral hydrate treatment (Figure <xref rid="jcmm17628-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), excluding the possibility that the protective effect was through a non‐cilium mechanism. Consistent with our findings, Cao et al. had also microinjected fertilized zebrafish eggs with 129‐MO, an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide against miRNA‐129, and found that the average number and length of cilia in Kupffer's vesicle were reduced by 50.5% and 37.3%, respectively, which lead to 71.0%–87.7% of the embryos or larvae exhibiting a curved body and pericardial oedema at 72 h post‐fertilization.<xref rid="jcmm17628-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Our findings indicated the important role of miRNA‐129‐3p in microgravity‐induced resorption of primary cilia and its potential as a therapeutic target to protect primary cilia and thus osteoblast function in microgravity.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, the current study revealed for the first time that exposure of the osteoblasts to microgravity downregulates the expression of miRNA‐129‐3p, which in turn causes the resorption of the primary cilia and the inhibition of the BMP‐2/Smad15/8 signalling pathway, and consequently leads to the impairments of osteoblast formation and function. Our results indicated that the protection of the primary cilia resulting from miRNA‐129‐3p treatment could be an effective countermeasure against the impairment of osteoblasts induced by microgravity. However, further studies are needed to verify this in vitro result in the situation of bone loss in hindlimb‐suspended rodents or even human beings in microgravity and to investigate whether it is the case in other types of cells and tissues.</p>
