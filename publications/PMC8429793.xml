              <abstract>
                <p>Many studies have shown that the space environment plays a pivotal role in changing the characteristics of conditional pathogens, especially their pathogenicity and virulence. However, <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, a type of conditional pathogen that has shown to a gradual increase in clinical morbidity in recent years, has rarely been reported for its impact in space. In this study, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> was exposed to a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment in high-aspect ratio rotating-wall vessel bioreactors for 14days, while the control group was exposed to the same bioreactors in a normal gravity (NG) environment. Then, combined phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses were conducted to compare the influence of the SMG and NG on <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>. The results showed that <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in simulated microgravity displayed an increased growth rate, enhanced biofilm formation ability, increased swimming motility, and metabolic alterations compared with those of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in normal gravity and the original strain of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>. Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) annotation analysis indicated that the increased growth rate might be related to the upregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in energy metabolism and conversion, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that the increased motility might be associated the upregulation of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) involved in locomotion, localization, biological adhesion, and binding, in accordance with the upregulated DEGs in cell motility according to COG classification, including pilP, pilM, flgE, flgG, and ronN. Additionally, the increased biofilm formation ability might be associated with the upregulation of DEPs involved in biofilm formation, the bacterial secretion system, biological adhesion, and cell adhesion, which were shown to be regulated by the differentially expressed genes (chpB, chpC, rpoN, pilA, pilG, pilH, and pilJ) through the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. These results suggested that simulated microgravity might increase the level of corresponding functional proteins by upregulating related genes to alter physiological characteristics and modulate growth rate, motility, biofilm formation, and metabolism. In conclusion, this study is the first general analysis of the phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> under simulated microgravity and provides some suggestions for future studies of space microbiology.</p>

              <p>In recent decades, with the development of medicine and space technology, microbial space safety has become one of the hot spots in modern medical research. The space environment involves microgravity, high pressure, low temperature, cosmic radiation, and malnourished environments (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">Horneck et al., 2010</xref>). However, microbes can still survive under such extreme conditions (<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Venkateswaran et al., 2014</xref>). Some studies have found microbes on surfaces, air filters and even in air samples from the International Space Station (ISS), and the diversity and abundance of microbes have been investigated (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Checinska et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Propionibacterium</italic>, and <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> have been identified as the most common species. Studies have showed that the space environment has some impacts on the immune system and motor system of humans, as well as on microorganisms in astronauts, such as growth rate, drug susceptibility, carbon source utilization and chemical sensitivity, biofilm formation ability, and motility (<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">Taylor, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Nadeau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">Vaishampayan and Grohmann, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, the impact of the space environment on microbes varies on different bacteria. Assuring that astronauts are sound in body and mind and have a good working capability is challenging. During spaceflight, the spaceship provides insulation from cosmic radiation and extreme temperature to some extent. Therefore, microgravity is a key influencing factor on astronauts and microbes.</p>
              <p>Given the constraint on spaceflight missions and the uncertainties in outer space experiments, land-based, high-aspect rotating vessels (HARVs) have been developed by NASA (<xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">Wolf et al., 1992</xref>). HARVs simulate microgravity by rotating cultures on an axis perpendicular to gravity, and the weight of microbes can be affected by low shear forces, which can suspend bacteria in a constant free fall state (<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">Radtke and Herbst-Kralovetz, 2012</xref>). Over the decades, HARVs have been widely used to explore the physiological states of microorganisms in a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">Nickerson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Lawal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Rasamiravaka and El Jaziri, 2016</xref>). In addition, HARVs provide a first-rank suspension growth environment that imitates some of the aspects of microgravity, such as a reduction in fluid shear, minimal turbulent motion, and short sedimentation of bacteria or host cells (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Hammond and Hammond, 2001</xref>). Some experts have verified the effectiveness of HARVs through mathematical analyses (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the reduction in shear stress within HARVs promotes the formation of 3D tissue aggregates (<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">Sawyer et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

                <p>The biofilm formation ability of the three groups was assessed using Filmtracer™ (LIVE/DEAD Biofilm Viability Kit, L10316, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, CA, United States) in conjunction with confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM; Leica TCS SP8, Berlin, Germany). LIVE/DEAD Biofilm Viability is a culture-independent method that depends on the cell membrane integrity as a viability measure; it utilizes a mixture of the SYTO9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain and a red fluorescent nucleic acid stain and propidium iodide. Live and dead bacteria can be distinguished without waiting for growth plate results. The working solution of the fluorescent stains was prepared by adding 3μl of the SYTO9 stain and 3μl of the propidium iodide stain to 1ml filter-sterilized water. The excitation/emission maxima for these dyes are approximately 480/500nm for SYTO9 staining and 490/635nm for propidium iodide. Three independent rounds of biofilm experiments were performed. Briefly, in each round of experiments, SMS, SMN, and SMO were inoculated in 35-mm confocal dishes (Solarbio, Beijing, China), cultivated at 37°C for 24h, and then rinsed two times with sterile water to eliminate nonadherent bacteria. Then, the generated biofilms were carefully stained with 200μl working solution stain for 30min in the dark at room temperature. It was important to immediately add the stain before the biofilm dried. After removing the stain and washing two times with sterile water, images were acquired from random positions, and the number of images from each layer varied according to the thickness of the biofilm. The maximum biofilm thickness of the uniform position in the current field of view was set as the biofilm thickness (<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">Shui et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

After the genomic DNA was segmented by Covaris, a genomic sequencing library was constructed. The whole genome was sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq and PacBio platforms according to standard quality controls, and raw reads were obtained. The raw reads were then filtered using the following steps: the adapter sequence was removed, bases other than A, G, C, and T at the 5'-end were removed, bases containing “N” reaches above 10% were removed; the ends of reads with lower sequencing quality (&lt;Q 20) were trimmed; and the adapters and quality-trimmed small fragments less than 25bp in length were removed. Self-correction was carried out using Falcon software (Version 0.3.0), and corrected reads were acquired. Quality assessment of the genome sequence obtained from the preliminary assembly determined whether the genome was contaminated, assessed the quality of sequencing, and assessed the condition of the genome. The bacterial genome scan map was assembled using SOAPdenove2 software, and multiple k-mer parameters were spliced after the sequences were optimized. Then, the optimal contig assembly results were obtained. The reads were compared to the contigs to form scaffolds according to the relationship between paired-ends and overlaps.

The RNA fragments were used to produce first strain cDNA by reverse transcriptase PCR with random primers. Then, second strain cDNA was created using dUTP instead of dTTP. The sticky end of the double strand cDNA was linked to the adaptor and digested with the UNG enzyme. Then, the cDNA fragments were enriched <italic>via</italic> PCR amplification and quantified by TBS380 (Picogreen), and the clusters were sequenced using the Illumunia Hiseq platform (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

                <p>The quantitative expression software RSEM was used to quantitatively analyze the expression levels of genes and transcripts. The transcripts per million (TPM) and reads per kilobase million (FPKM) of each gene were calculated in accordance with gene length, and the regulation mechanism of genes were revealed by combining the sequence function information. According to the expression of genes in different samples, Venn, correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) analyses were performed. Venn analysis was used to display genes that were shared and uniquely expressed between samples. Correlation analysis of the biological replicate samples, on the one hand, checked whether the variation between biological replicates met the expectations of the experimental design, and on the other hand, provided a basic reference for the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). PCA could reduce the complexity of the data and determine the relationship and variation between samples. Finally, the read counts were mapped to the genes. Differential gene expression analysis was analyzed using DESeq2 software, and genes yielding a value of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and fold change (FC) &gt;2 in two different samples were identified as DEGs (<xref rid="ref68" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

Then, the purified peptides were subjected to an EASY-nLC 1,200 instrument (Thermo, United States) and Q_Exactive HF-X (Thermo, United States) to obtain raw data. The raw data were converted into MGF format by the Thermo Scientific tool Proteome Discoverer software (Version 2.4), and the exported MGF files were searched against the established database using the Sequest and Mascot modules.

                <p>The accession number for the resequencing data of the SMS is SRR14181238, and that for SMN is SRR14181566. SMO was used as a reference strain, and SMN and SMS were mapped to the genome of SMO to estimate genomic changes. One indel was found between SMN and SMO, including 10 related genes in coding regions and one related gene in an intergenic region. One indel was found between SMS and SMO, including 10 related genes in coding regions and one related gene in an intergenic region. In addition, one SNP was found between SMS and SMO, including eight related genes in coding regions and one related gene in an intergenic region. The reference base “G” was mutated to “C,” which attributed to transversion mutation, the related upstream and downstream genes were mostly about ribosomal protein and ATP-binding protein. The details of the indels and SNP located in the CDS are presented in <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

                <p>To gain an understanding of the effects of SMG on <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> from a systematic biological perspective, the DEGs and DEPs were integrated to identify overlapping genes that were differentially expressed in both the transcriptome and proteome.

The GO enrichment analysis indicated that biological processes such as biological adhesion, cell adhesion, cell projection, and pilus organization might be affected in SMS. In addition, cellular components such as intrinsic components of the membrane, integral components of the membrane, membrane parts, and external encapsulating structure parts might also be affected in SMS (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>). The KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that biofilm formation and the two-component system between up-DEGs and up-DEPs might be affected in SMS (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11C</xref>), which was in agreement with the DEGs enriched in the KEGG pathways at the transcriptomic level. Besides, four genes (chpC, pilJ, pilH, and pilG) involved in biofilm formation and seven genes (rpoN, chpB, chpC, pilA, pilG, pilH, and pilJ) involved in the two-component system were significantly upregulated.</p>

              <p>The physiological changes and metabolic responses of microorganisms to the extreme environments of space have attracted increasing attention. Monitoring microorganisms in space stations plays an important role in monitoring the safety of spacecraft and the health of astronauts. With the advancement of science and technology, more space and ground-assisted research technologies have helped us better understand the impact of the space environment on microorganisms. In recent years, a large number of studies have reported on the effects of space environment and simulated space environment on the physiological characteristics of microorganisms and the relationship between microorganisms and human beings. However, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>, as a new opportunistic pathogen that is found in water, soil, humans, and animals, has rarely been studied for its effect on the space environment. <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> is an important nosocomial pathogen and is closely related to clinical infections, especially in immunocompromised people. Hence, astronauts with low immunity are susceptible to <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> during spaceflight. Currently, there is no integrated genetic information available for <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> after cultivation in the SMG environment, which makes it difficult to explore the physiological changes and metabolic responses of the organism after exposure to this unique condition. Overall, our results confirm that in SMG environment, the physiological characteristics of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> have undergo some changes, such as a faster growth rate, enhanced biofilm formation ability, and increased mobility. Furthermore, through multiomics analysis, 118 DEPs were found to be upregulated, most of which were related to biofilm formation, pilus organization, bacterial motility, locomotion, and the bacterial secretion system. At the genetic level, 113 DEGs were upregulated. For instance, DEGs such as pilP, pilM, flgE, flgG, and ronN, which are related to cell motility, were significantly upregulated. In addition, the chpB, chpC, rpoN, pilA, pilG, pilH, and pilJ genes, which are related to biofilm formation and cell outer membrane, were also significantly upregulated. These upregulated DEGs were consistent with the upregulated DEPs.</p>
              <p>Considering the different culture conditions, cultivation times, and strains used, previous study showed that microorganisms exposed to a space environment or cultivated in the SMG environment on the ground exhibited different growth characteristics. Most researchers have shown that microgravity or weightlessness in space can significantly increase the growth rate of bacteria (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Benoit and Klaus, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Javadi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Yim et al., 2020</xref>). Compared with ground group, some studies have shown that under microgravity or weightlessness conditions, the growth rate of some bacteria does not change significantly (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Coil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Fajardo-Cavazos et al., 2018</xref>). A few studies have even shown that the flight strain has a significantly decreased growth rate compared with that the normal gravity group (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016</xref>). Our study illustrated (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Fajardo-Cavazos and Nicholson, 2016</xref>) that SMS exhibited an increased growth rate compared with that of SMN and SMO. It is worth noting that under SMG or weightlessness, the underlying mechanism of the microbial growth rate is still unclear. Some experts believe that this may be related to the increase in the utilization of nutrients by bacteria in a specific environment, and the corresponding reduction in extracellular material transport (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2002</xref>). Through the GO enrichment analysis performed in this research, we found that the increased growth rate of SMS might be related to some upregulated DEPs involved in biological regulation, metabolic process, cellular anatomical entity, and catalytic activity. Moreover, according to the KEGG pathway analysis, some of the upregulated DEPs in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism were also central to the increased growth rate. In addition, according to the COG annotations, 20 DEPs related to intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport were overexpressed in SMS. In conclusion, we believe that the accumulation of these changes may increase the growth rate of SMS.</p>
              <p>Astronauts during spaceflight are in a state of reduced immunity, which accompanied by changes in microbiota. Some studies have found that some characteristics of bacteria have a certain correlation with their motility (<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Portela et al., 2019</xref>). The differences in the structure and number of flagella, fimbriae, and pili of bacteria greatly affect their motility. As a key microbial behavior, motility plays a key role in nutrient absorption, tissue localization and invasion, biofilm formation, and pathogenicity. Changes in motility may cause changes in the bacterial distribution in the human body, and these motility changes may damage the health of astronauts. Therefore, the effect of microgravity on bacteria can be observed and explained by the change in bacterial motility to a certain extent. Although, domestic and foreign researchers have studied the influence of microgravity on microbial motility, the exact way in which microgravity causes these changes is still unclear. A reasonable explanation suggests that bacteria are affected by microgravity on account of the quiescent fluid environment enclosing bacteria in a liquid suspension culture, and another explanation is that the buoyant convection of low dense fluid in the vicinity of cell plays a key role (<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">Tirumalai et al., 2017</xref>). <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Portela et al. (2019)</xref> found that after spaceflight, the morphology of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> changed under Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Compared with the normal gravity group, the samples after spaceflight showed a decreased size and an increased number of outer membrane vesicles. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Benoit and Klaus (2007)</xref> revealed that under the same spaceflight conditions, motile bacteria displayed greater cell numbers than nonmotile bacteria. Microbial motility is meditated by an electromotive gradient of ions across the cell membrane, so the disparity between each concentration and nutrient depletion produced by microgravity and SMG may have led to the difference in motility (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">DeRosier, 1998</xref>). <xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al. (2007)</xref> revealed that <italic>Salmonella Typhimurium</italic> cultivated in LB in HARVs showed a decrease in motility; downregulations of fliEST, flhD, and flgM; and upregulation of filC. <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Crabbé et al. (2011)</xref> found upregulated gene expression related to motility in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> under SMG, including fliACDGS, fleLNP, and flgM, but there were no obvious changes in the expression of genes related to motility after spaceflight. <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Duscher et al. (2018)</xref> revealed that <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> showed a trend of upregulation of flhA and flgM after 12 and 24h of cultivating in SMG. Interestingly, <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Tucker et al. (2007)</xref> found that even in the same HARV environment, <italic>E. coli</italic> in different nutrients displayed different motility and had different expression of genes related to motility. In this study, compared with SMN and SMO, SMS showed more bacterial intercellular mucus and rougher membranes under 20,000x SEM. The swimming experiment revealed that the bacteria in the SMS group had increased motility compared with those in the SMN and SMO groups. In addition, considering that the swimming experiment was conducted under ground conditions and there would be some variables affecting the results, we will take videos of precultured bacterial cells directly from three samples to compare their motility in the subsequent experiment. Through the GO enrichment analysis performed in this research, we found that the increased motility of the SMS group may be related to some upregulated DEPs involved in locomotion, localization, biological adhesion, and binding. Moreover, according to the COG annotations, ten DEPs related to cell motility and seven DEPs related to cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis were overexpressed in SMS. In addition, according to the GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis, DEGs, including pilP, pilM, flgE, flgG, and ronN, which are associated with cell motility, were overexpressed in SMS. These upregulated DEGs were consistent with the changes in the DEPs. In conclusion, we believe that the overlap of these changes may increase the motility of SMS in the SMG environment.</p>
              <p>Most of the studies on <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> biofilms are related to the effects of antibiotics, hormones, or combinations of drugs. For instance, <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016a)</xref> discovered the synergistic inhibition of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin on the biofilm formation of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>, and <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Ciacci et al. (2019)</xref> found an <italic>in vitro</italic> synergistic therapeutic effect of colistin and N-acetylcysteine on <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>. However, there are few studies on the characteristics of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in the space environment and SMG. Therefore, we focused on microgravity as a starting point to investigate the physiological characteristics of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in a microgravity environment. The formation of biofilms in bacteria was first carried out under microgravity in 2001 (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">McLean et al., 2001</xref>). After 24h of exposure to microgravity, the formation of biofilms in <italic>E. coli</italic> increased (<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were cultured in a rotary cell culture system under microgravity and the biofilm formation ability increased in the SMG group compared with that in the NG group (<xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Yim et al., 2020</xref>). The biofilm formation of the bacterial pathogen <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> was also increased after the space shuttle mission STS-115 (<xref rid="ref60" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). These results were consistent with our results. However, <xref rid="ref70" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2019)</xref> found that <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> showed decreased biofilm formation after a spaceflight on the Shenzhou 11 spacecraft of China. <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> formed different subgroups, M1 and M2, on solid medium, and an increased biofilm forming ability was found in M1 compared with that in M2 in SMG (<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, there is no general conclusion on the influence of microgravity on microorganisms. The differences in strains, culture methods, and durations spent in microgravity may lead to different results. In our study, the biofilms that formed at the bottom of the HARV bioreactors in the SMS group were thicker than those in the SMN group. Quantitative biofilm experiments showed that the biofilm formation ability of SMS was more than twice that of either SMN or SMO. CLSM analysis illustrated that the biofilm thickness in SMS was thicker than that in SMN or SMO. Through the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses performed in this research, we found that the biofilm formation ability of SMS might be related to some of the upregulated DEPs involved in intrinsic components of the membrane, integral components of the membrane, type II protein secretion systems, galactose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism. Moreover, according to the COG annotations, seven DEPs related to cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis and 20 DEPs related to intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport were overexpressed in SMS. In addition, according to the GO enrichment analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis, DEGs, including the chpB, chpC, rpoN, pilA, pilG, pilH, and pilJ genes, which are associated with biofilm formation and cell outer membrane, were overexpressed in SMS. These upregulated DEGs were consistent with the changes in the DEPs. In conclusion, we believe that these changes may increase the biofilm formation of SMS in the SMG environment.</p>
              <p>To sum up, the changes in genome, transcriptome, and proteome can to some extent explain the phenotypic changes such as motility and biofilm formation ability. The present study might serve a basis for future studies of the complex mechanism by which bacteria adapt to the space. However, the overall changes in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> at the level of DNA or RNA are still limited. Considering the complexity of space environment and the limitation of simulated experiment condition on the ground, more relevant experiments are needed for deep research.</p>
