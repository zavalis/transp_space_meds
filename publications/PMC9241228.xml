                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique and complex built environment with the ISS surface microbiome originating from crew and cargo or from life support recirculation in an almost entirely closed system. The Microbial Tracking 1 (MT-1) project was the first ISS environmental surface study to report on the metagenome profiles without using whole-genome amplification. The study surveyed the microbial communities from eight surfaces over a 14-month period. The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project aimed to continue the work of MT-1, sampling an additional four flights from the same locations, over another 14 months.</p>

                  <title>Methods</title>
                  <p id="Par2">Eight surfaces across the ISS were sampled with sterile wipes and processed upon return to Earth. DNA extracted from the processed samples (and controls) were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) to detect intact/viable cells or left untreated and to detect the total DNA population (free DNA/compromised cells/intact cells/viable cells). DNA extracted from PMA-treated and untreated samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics. Samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi to supplement the above results.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par3"><italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and <italic>Malassezia</italic> sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. Overall, the ISS surface microbiome was dominated by organisms associated with the human skin. Multi-dimensional scaling and differential abundance analysis showed significant temporal changes in the microbial population but no spatial differences. The ISS antimicrobial resistance gene profiles were however more stable over time, with no differences over the 5-year span of the MT-1 and MT-2 studies. Twenty-nine antimicrobial resistance genes were detected across all samples, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes were reconstructed from the dataset, resulting in 82 MAGs. Functional assessment of the collective MAGs showed a propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses showed strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera. Culture analysis showed the microbial load to be on average 3.0 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cfu/m<sup>2</sup></p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par4">Utilizing various metagenomics analyses and culture methods, we provided a comprehensive analysis of the ISS surface microbiome, showing microbial burden, bacterial and fungal species prevalence, changes in the microbiome, and resistome over time and space, as well as the functional capabilities and microbial interactions of this unique built microbiome. Data from this study may help to inform policies for future space missions to ensure an ISS surface microbiome that promotes astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.</p>

The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique hermetically sealed built environment and being one of the most isolated inhabited built environments; access to it is highly controlled and limited. In between the routine arrival of new supplies and crew members, the ISS is completely isolated from external microbial sources. The arrival of new crew members and supplies is therefore the only source for introducing new micro-organisms to the ISS. These isolated conditions have raised concerns about the introduction and proliferation of potentially harmful microorganisms into the microbial communities of piloted spaceflight and how this could affect human health.</p>
              <p id="Par6">For decades, space-faring nations were interested in the influence of microgravity, radiation, and other spaceflight conditions on the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. During the Apollo program, NASA collected pre- and post-flight samples from locations within the Command Module as part of a program to identify medically relevant microbes and to elucidate changes in the crew microflora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Subsequently, Skylab surfaces were swabbed pre-launch and periodically throughout the three manned missions to characterize the bacterial exchange between the crew and internal surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The Soviet Union regularly monitored the microflora of Salyut 6, 7, and Mir during their operation. Onboard station Mir, air samples were collected approximately once a month, and surface samples from various locations throughout the spacecraft were collected at the end of each mission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thorough monitoring onboard Mir revealed potential health and equipment risks from the bacteria and fungi that colonized the interior surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These culture-based surveillance procedures were instrumental in developing the microbial surveillance standards for the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par7">Since inception, to maintain the cleanliness of ISS, traditional culture-based approaches are being used and microbial burden measured. However, research activities are being conducted to characterize the microbiome of ISS surfaces and air using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. Air, water, and surface samples were collected during the initial stage of habitation of the ISS to identify the baseline microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since then, several studies have investigated the microbial population of ISS dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition to cataloging the microbial population of the ISS, studies have also focused on the persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] onboard the ISS. These investigations provide important information for the long-term health and safety of crew members.</p>
              <p id="Par8">The previous Microbial Tracking-1 (MT-1) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] examined the community structure and function of eight ISS surfaces over a period of 14 months, during three sampling sessions. The Microbial Tracking-2 (MT-2) study continued this objective and further sampled the same surface locations over the course of 1.5 years, during four additional flight sessions. In this paper, the MT-2 samples were analyzed for species presence and stability of the entire microbial community. The microbial diversity and composition for each location and time point were characterized to reveal how the microbial population was changing over time. The persistence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also analyzed to evaluate the stability of the ISS resistome in a changing microbiome. Co-occurrence analysis between bacterial and fungal species was analyzed to gain insight into the microbial associations in this unique built environment. Genomes were assembled from the metagenome reads (referred to as metagenome-assembled genomes, or MAGs) with taxonomy and functional assessment analyses performed on these MAGs. This paper also compared the results obtained during the previous MT-1 study. Together, these studies provide snapshots of the microbial population on the ISS across 5 years, allowing for dynamics and stability patterns of the surface microbiome to be evaluated.</p>

                  <p id="Par23">To extract functional information from these MAGs, annotation was performed on each MAG. Clusters of orthologous groups (COG) information was extracted from each annotated MAG and compiled together to provide a functional assessment of the collective microbial community, with the complete list of each COG ID presented in Dataset S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>. Each annotated gene with a COG ID was then grouped together based on COG functional categories and the proportion of each functional category represented in the pie chart in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. The most represented functional groups were amino acid transport and metabolism (12%); translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (11%); and carbohydrate transport and metabolism (9%).

                  <p id="Par24">We decided to examine MAG <italic>Pseudomonas granadensis</italic> (bin.33, 99.38% completion) in further detail because it was 99.97% similar (compared by average nucleotide identity) to the whole-genome sequences of <italic>P. granadensis</italic> isolates, cultured during this study (flight 4, dining table) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

It also exhibits biocontrol properties through its protection of plant roots from plant pathogens. Examination of MAG <italic>P. granadensis</italic> (bin.33) showed 17 genomic islands, which is indicative of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. Functional analysis showed that 3% of its genome was made up of virulence and defense genes specifically related to tolerance/resistance of fluroquinolones, beta-lactams, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium, streptothricin, chromium, and colicin E2, as well as having multi-drug efflux pumps (Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par25">The microbiome of eight surfaces from across the ISS was sampled during four separate sampling sessions (F4âF7). The viable microbiome was assessed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples that had been treated with PMA, as well as with plate count assays. Both techniques were consistent in their results, showing that the microbiome was similar across all eight locations for a given flight and validates what was previously published for MT-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and with other ISS surface microbiome studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The spatial uniformity in this hermetically sealed, closed habitat suggests that microbial movement occurs readily, which should be taken into consideration if a situation arises that requires microbial sequestration.</p>
              <p id="Par26">While no spatial differences were found, temporal differences did exist, with different microbial profiles and microbial loads observed among the various flights, consistent with our previous analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One influence driving these temporal differences could be the different cohorts of astronauts onboard the ISS during each sampling session. Two recent studies have noted that the crew microbiome may shape microbial composition on ISS habitable surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and in this study, the majority of bacteria and fungi that were detected from surfaces were human-associated, such as <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Propionibacterium</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, and <italic>Malassezia</italic> or those related to food products that are ingested by humans, such as <italic>Aspergillus kawachii</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>. Astronaut-ISS surface exchange would parallel what has been found with Earth-based built environment studies, where human occupation significantly impacts a given indoor environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. To garner a better understanding of just how significant human-environment interactions are in shaping the microbiomes of the ISS and the astronauts residing there, ongoing analyses by the MT-2 project team are examining astronaut data at pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight time points and examining their microbiomes in conjunction with the ISS surface microbiome.</p>
              <p id="Par27"><italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and <italic>Malassezia</italic> sp. were the most represented bacterial and fungal species, respectively, on the ISS. While bacteria dominated the ISS microbiome in both the PMA and non-PMA samples, it is worth noting that the proportion of fungi increased from 10% in the total population (viable/dead) to 37% in the viable population, while bacteria decreased from 82% (total) to 58% (viable). This would suggest that viable/intact fungal cells are more readily captured when ISS surfaces are sampled, compared to bacteria. This could be because these fungi are able to withstand the routine cleaning regimes on the ISS or the conditions surrounding the sample storage/descent to Earth/sample processing, better than those bacteria.</p>
              <p id="Par28">In addition to examining which microbes were present, we also examined their properties, which may help inform policies and practices to mitigate harmful effects on astronauts and the spacecraft. One such functional examination was that of the ISS âviable resistomeâ which is the composition of antimicrobial resistance genes within the PMA-treated metagenomic dataset. We found a genetic composition that could provide resistance against 17 classes of drugs, many of which were broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline, all of which are part of the medical toolkit onboard the ISS. The most prevalent resistance genes were against macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics and those involved in multidrug resistance, such as outer membrane porins, efflux pumps, and ABC transporters. MLS antibiotics occupy one of the leading positions among antibiotics used in outpatient treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and are used to treat a range of bacterial infections, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], thus making it a very important drug on the ISS. Genetic resistance to MLS was found in every single sample in the total metagenomic dataset (non-PMA-treated), and in 17 out of 32 PMA-treated samples, making MLS resistance widespread across the ISS.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The AMR resistance profiles did not differ across all seven flights, suggesting that even amidst changes in community composition (which we observed among the seven flights), the resistome of this microbial community is relatively stable and alludes to genetic redundancy. Functional redundancy has been documented in other microbial systems such as in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], human gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], oceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. One study has shown that HGT plays a substantial role in maintaining redundancy, and when HGT rates were high, the functional profile of the microbiome was very stable and recalcitrant to change, even when taxonomy was variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Our results emphasize the importance of deciphering microbial behavior and community interactions for better approaches to safety and health, since removing or preventing the growth of one or two species may not ameliorate any negative functional effects.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Strong microbial interactions were observed in this study through a co-occurrence analysis used to predict the likelihood of genera to co-inhabit a particular niche, either through positive associations or through negative ones. While many positive associations were calculated, no negative associations were accounted for. The genus that exhibited the most positive associations was <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and co-occurred with both bacteria and fungi, while at the other âendâ of the spectrum, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> had no associations and exhibited only random occurrences. While wet lab studies would need to be conducted to make an accurate assessment of the impact of these ISS polymicrobial community interactions on the surrounding environment and astronaut health, some inferences can be made from the literature. In our study, <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Fusarium</italic> formed a strong association. Co-infection studies of <italic>A. flavus</italic> with <italic>F. graminearum</italic> or <italic>F. verticillioides</italic> in maize have shown that the presence of these <italic>Fusarium</italic> species leads to enhanced aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by <italic>A. flavus</italic>, even in the absence of any changes in growth, probably due to a stress response caused by fungal competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. AFB1 is a secondary metabolite produced by <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> and is a very potent carcinogen that can cause hepatocellular carcinoma in humans when ingested or when it permeates the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. While reads for <italic>A. flavus</italic> were extremely low on ISS surfaces, the species is naturally found in foods, such as grains, cereal, corn, and peanuts. In light of the co-occurrence interactions described above and the known fact that the ISS is a stressed environment for microbes, which could increase AFB1 production as well as other mycotoxins, it may be necessary to pay close attention to microbial monitoring of food sources destined for space.</p>
              <p id="Par31"><italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> were another positive association found in the dataset and may prove to be beneficial for both crew and the ISS. In an in vitro study analyzing mixed <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>-<italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms, it was shown that <italic>S. aureus</italic> strongly inhibited the development of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The antibiofilm effects of <italic>S. aureus</italic> on <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> were a lack of extracellular matrix (ECM) disorganized fungal structures, abortive hyphae, and limited hyphal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Conidia were also scarce, had modifications on their surface, and showed lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> single culture biofilms showed extremely organized structures, abundant hyphal growth, hyphal anastomosis, and channels, as well as some conidia and ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> biofilms (i) cause aspergillosis, an infection causing allergic reactions, lung disease, and infections in other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; (ii) have been implicated in microbially induced corrosion of bronze and copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; and (iii) have been found in tap water in private homes, hospitals, and industrial premises, resulting in altered taste, odor, the production of allergenic compounds, and mycotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. <italic>Aspergillus</italic> biofilms are difficult to eradicate once formed, so preventing their formation, possibly with mixed microbial communities of the ârightâ organisms, may be the best way to combat its effects on the ISS.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Functional assessment was also performed by assembling reads into contigs to obtain metagenome-associated genomes or âMAGs.â Across the samples collected, 82 MAGs were able to be constructed and annotated with 15 having over 90% completeness, and comprising environmental, human-associated, and probiotic bacteria. The functional profile of the collective MAGs showed the highest representation of (i) amino acid transport and metabolism and (ii) translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis. While these two pathways are among the main metabolic pathways in bacteria and fungi, their relative abundances were higher than carbohydrate utilization pathways. This may be significant in the context of a recent study comparing âunrestrictedâ built environments (public houses, public buildings, private houses) with âconfinedâ built environments (intensive care units (ICU), cleanrooms, cleanroom gowning areas) where it was shown that each of the three âconfinedâ environments had a considerably higher representation of amino acid utilization compared to carbohydrate utilization, with the opposite being true for the âunrestrictedâ environments (higher carbohydrate utilization compared to amino acids) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. While there are too few comparative studies to make any assumptions, it does raise the question as to whether organisms in more extreme built environments such as the ISS, ICU, and cleanrooms rely on different metabolic processes to survive and/or proliferate. The ability to generate good-quality MAGs from this dataset will allow us to better understand the dynamics of exchange across the ISS. For example, future analyses by the MT-2 project team will compare the ISS surface MAGs and astronaut MAGs (who were onboard the ISS at the time of collection) to track the movement of strains across ISS locations and across astronauts. Questions we hope to address in the forthcoming work are what factors contribute to the spread of certain organisms from one location to another, how long does a strain persist once deposited on a surface and after cleaning, and whether there is an exchange between astronauts even if they were not on board at the same time.</p>

                <p id="Par34">Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA) by moistening polyester wipes (9â³âÃâ9â³; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ), each with 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Moistened wipes were aseptically transferred to a sterile zip lock bag and then assembled into the ISS sampling kit (at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC)), which also contained sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190), benzalkonium chloride wipes (HygeaÂ®, PDI-BZK D35185), and sterile bitran bags (VWR, Cat. 4742-S) for return. The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the premoistened polyester wipes which were the same locations as those sampled during the previous microbial tracking study (MT-1). The list of locations sampled is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Flight 4 sampling occurred in 2017, and flight 5, 6, and 7 sampling occurred in 2018. A diagram of locations can be found in Figure 1 of the MT-1 published manuscript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par35">As per the study requirements, there was no cleaning at least 4 days prior to sampling. Cleaning outside that time frame was conducted as per routine ISS activities and was performed with disinfectant wipes containing octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.0399%), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethylbenzylammonium chloride (0.0532%).</p>
                <p id="Par36">During each flight sampling session, the same crew member sampled each of the eight locations. Using the sterile gloves from the sampling kit, he/she sampled 1 m<sup>2</sup> with the pre-moistened polyester wipes and donned a new pair of individually packed sterile gloves before sampling the next location. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each flight session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the ISS and brought back to Earth along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. After sample collection, the samples were stored at 4 Â°C in orbit and then returned to Earth after 10 days for flight 4, 8 days for flight 5, 22 days for flight 6, and 11 days for flight 7. The kits were delivered to JPL immediately after arrival to Earth at 4 Â°C with processing at JPL commencing within 2 h of receipt.</p>

The wipe inside the bottle was shaken vigorously for 2 min followed by concentration with a Concentrating Pipette using 0.22-Î¼m Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO).

The PMA- and non-PMA-treated aliquots were incubated in the dark at RT for 5 min, followed by 15 min of photoactivation using the PMA-Liteâ¢ LED Photolysis Device, specifically designed for photoactivation of PMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA). The PMA- and non-PMA-treated aliquots were split into two 0.75-mL aliquots. One aliquot was transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), followed by bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten aliquot and the aliquot without bead beating were combined for their corresponding PMA-treated and non-treated samples. DNA extraction was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with the manufacturerâs instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit. A Maxwell control without any sample added in its cartridge was run concurrently with the samples.

Briefly, DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Quality and fragment size were assessed on the Agilent Tapestation 4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were quantitated using the Qubit fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and normalized to equivalent DNA quantities, pooled, and diluted according to the manufacturerâs standard recommendations. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 with the NextSeq Series High Output Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), using 150 base pair paired-end reads. Taxonomic classification of the metagenomic reads was accomplished using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit (LMAT version 1.2.4b with the âApril 4, 2014, LMAT Grandâ reference database [lmat-4-14.20mer.db]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

Taxa with <italic>P</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered differentially abundant, and all <italic>P</italic> values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par45">The raw metagenomic sequences were analyzed with DeepARG: a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data which uses the CARD and ARDB databases for classification using the DIAMOND aligner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Briefly, the pipeline first removes low-quality reads using TRIMMOMATIC, then merges the reads into one big file (VSEARCH) which are then classified with the deepARG algorithm, and the results are normalized to the 16S rRNA abundance in the sample. The parameters used to predict the AMR genes from our metagenomics dataset were based on 80% coverage, 50% homology, a minimum probability of 0.8, and an <italic>E</italic>-value of 1eâ10.</p>

                <p id="Par46">Genus co-occurrence from the PMA-treated samples was examined using the âcooccurâ R package. This package applied the probabilistic model of genus co-occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] to a set of genera distributed among the 32 samples (8 locations, 4 flights). The algorithm calculated the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence between each pair of genera. The expected frequency was based on the distribution of each genus being random and independent of the other genera. The package also includes functions for visualizing co-occurrence results and was used to prepare Figs. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>.</p>

                <p id="Par47">Metagenome assembled genomes were constructed from the 32 samples (F4âF7, non-PMA-treated samples) using the MetaWRAP pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP">https://github.com/bxlab/metaWRAP</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] which performed read quality control, assembly, visualization, taxonomic profiling, extracting draft genomes (binning), and functional annotation. Assembly was performed with MegaHit (due to the large dataset) and the bin_refinement cutoff set to minimum completion of 50% and maximum contamination of 10%. Taxonomy was assigned using NCBI_nt and NCBI_tax databases and verified with CheckM. The abundances of each bin (i.e., MAG) in each sample was expressed as genome copies per million reads using Salmon. Functional analysis of the annotated genomes was performed by extracting the cluster of orthologous group (COG) IDs from the annotated gff files generated by MetaWRAP and assigning each ID to a COG category (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog/</ext-link>). The draft genome of <italic>Pseudomonas granadensis</italic> was analyzed by SEED and the Rapid Annotation of microbial genomes using Subsystems Technology (RAST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and genomic islands assessed with IslandViewer 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p>

Bacteria were grown on R2A and blood agar plates and the cfu/m<sup>2</sup> averaged from each type of plate and then plotted. Fungi were grown on PDA plates. Each dot and corresponding number represents one of the eight surface locations sampled. X-axis labels: âBACâ refers to the bacterial load and âPDAâ to the fungal load. Fx refers to one of the four flight sampling events. <bold>Figure S2.</bold> Alpha diversity metrics for surface samples. The species richness (top row), exponentiated Shannon index (middle row), and inverse Simpson Index (bottom row) are shown for each sample. F4 (green), F5 (yellow), F6 (purple), and F7 (red) samples are grouped by surface location. <bold>Figure S3.</bold> NMDS plot of MT-1 and MT-2 surface samples. Samples were colored by surface location (A) and flight group (B) to visualize samples clustering. The distance between samples was determined using the Jaccard dissimilarity. <bold>Figure S4.</bold> Top 12 most abundant bacterial species by flight group. The top 12 most abundance fungal species for F4 (A), F5 (B), F6 (C), and F7 (D) were determined separately. The read counts for each species are shown by surface location. âOtherâ refers to those bacterial species detected that were not in the top 12. <bold>Figure S5.</bold> Top 12 most abundant fungal species by flight group. The top 12 most abundance fungal species for F4 (A), F5 (B), F6 (C), and F7 (D) were determined separately. The read counts for each species are shown by surface location. âOtherâ refers to those fungal species detected that were not in the top 12. <bold>Figure S6.</bold> Co-occurrence analysis. Co-occurrence analysis was performed using the 50 most abundant genera to determine associations amongst organisms. The x-axis shows the organisms that were included in the analysis and the y-axis shows the percent of either negative, positive or random associations. Gray bars represent random associations, blue bars represent positive associations and yellow bars represent negative associations. The genera are listed in order of least occurrences (left) to most occurrences (right). <bold>Figure S7.</bold> Heat map of ISS resistome. The metagenomic dataset was analyzed with DeepARG to look for anti-microbial resistance genes. The genes were then grouped into classes of resistance (i.e âbeta-lactamâ), which is displayed in this heatmap (y-axis). The heat-map shows the relative abundance of each resistance class in each sample collected, with red being the most abundant and green the least. Gray indicates zero counts detected in that sample The samples analyzed (x-axis) are from the non-PMA treated samples. x-axis naming: Fx_xS, with F referring to the flight (i.e., F4) and S referring to the location of the surface sampled (i.e., 1S is location 1, the port panel next to cupola). The AMR counts were normalized based on the 16S rRNA counts. <bold>Figure S8.</bold> Subsystem category distribution of <italic>Pseudomonas fluroescens</italic> metagenome assembled genome. The metaWRAP pipeline was used to assemble and annotate draft genomes constructed from the metagenomic data of 32 samples (F4-F7), otherwise known as MAGs- metagenomic assembled genomes. The MAG of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> was further analyzed with SEED and RAST. <bold>Figure S9.</bold> Read counts for control samples. The top 12 most abundance species across the control samples are colored. The read counts in the controls were significantly less than those detected in the samples and had different profiles.</p>
