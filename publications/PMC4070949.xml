              <abstract>
                <p>Experimental study was made by keeping human peripheral blood lymphocytes under simulated microgravity in a Rotary Cell Culture System bioreactor to investigate the changes that occur in the number of chromosomes, the expression rate of chromosome fragile site, and the expressions of DNA replication- and repair-related genes. Experimental results indicate simulated microgravity has no effect on the numerical chromosome instability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, but it enhances the structural chromosome instability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes through the inhibition of DNA replication and the reduction of DNA repair. So, the mechanism of chromosome fragile site induced by simulated microgravity can be explained using the changes that occur in the chromosome structure of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, the DNA replication and repair under the effect of simulated microgravity.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Chromosome instability (CIN) is a great concern for manned-space flight because of the space environment-induced damages to human chromosomes observed in the lymphocytes of Astronauts <xref rid="pone.0100595-Ducray1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Structural and numerical chromosome instabilities are the two aspects of CIN commonly observed in solid tumors <xref rid="pone.0100595-Burrell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100595-Gollin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The numerical chromosome instability is known as aneuploid, and the structural chromosome instability means deletion, inversion, translocation and rearrangement of chromosomes <xref rid="pone.0100595-Mondello1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100595-Ricke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Chromosome fragile sites are specific loci that preferentially exhibit gaps and breaks in metaphase chromosomes after DNA synthesis is partially inhibited <xref rid="pone.0100595-Durkin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, breaks may cause deletion of chromosome, fragmentation without centromere and enhancement of chromosome aberration <xref rid="pone.0100595-Glover1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. So, the expression of chromosome fragile site is closely related to chromosome aberration.</p>
              <p>About 120 fragile sites have been described so far. They are normally stable in cultured cells, but they form visible gaps and breaks in metaphase chromosomes under certain culture conditions or by treatment with specific chemical agents. These fragile sites can be generally categorized into two classes of common and rare fragile sites according to their population frequencies and patterns of inheritance <xref rid="pone.0100595-Durkin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. There are about 90 common fragile sites listed in the Genome Database (GDB) at present <xref rid="pone.0100595-Durkin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Common fragile sites are normally stable in somatic cells. However, they display gaps, breaks, rearrangements and other features of unstable DNA, which is referred to as the expression of fragile site, when the cells are cultured under folate or thymidylate stress or with a low dose of aphidicolin to partially inhibit DNA synthesis <xref rid="pone.0100595-Glover1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100595-OKeefe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The expression of fragile site is the result of a cell which escapes from the cell cycle checkpoint and then forms a DNA single- or double strand break. The cell cycle can be arrested and the unreplicated chromosomal regions can be repaired if the cell cycle checkpoint ATR is activated and DNA replication is stopped <xref rid="pone.0100595-Casper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100595-Cha1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p>
              <p>Microgravity in space is a kind of culture stress which can induce the inhibition of cell proliferation, the occurrence of cytoskeleton disorder, the structural change in a bipolar spindle, the arrestment of a cell cycle and/or the alteration of a gene expression. However, little work is done on the chromosome instability of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) under space microgravity or simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>Therefore, our study on the effect of simulated microgravity is continued by keeping human PBL cells under simulated microgravity in a Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) bioreactor to investigate the effect of simulated microgravity on the structural chromosome instability of PBL cells. This article is a summary report on our recent work to complete our study on the effect of simulated microgravity, and it reports new findings that extend the results we reported earlier <xref rid="pone.0100595-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p>

These two methods are used to obtain clear gaps for the present study. The blood collected from volunteers is cultured in folate-free M199 medium (5% FBS, pH 7.5), 25 Âµg/ml PHA (Sigma) and antibiotics (streptomycin: 100 Âµg/ml; penicillin G: 100 U/ml), and 0.4 ÂµM aphidicolin is added to the medium 26 hours before cell harvesting. The cells are harvested through the same process of chromosome observation. Coded (blinded) slides are scored under a BX41 Olympus microscope at 1000Ã magnification. 100 mitotic images are collected for each sample. The numbers of cells observed and the numbers of chromosomes with fragile sites are counted according to nonstaining chromosome, chromatid gaps or chromosome breakpoint.

                <title>The number of chromosomes does not change under different culture conditions, and so, simulated microgravity has no effect on the numerical chromosome instability of human PBL cells</title>
                <p>Two different culture media, RPMI-1640 with 20% FBS, and folate-free M199 medium with 5% FBS and 0.4 ÂµM aphidicolin were used under 1 <italic>g</italic> or simulated microgravity for the present study. In order to investigate the environmental influence on the chromosome segregation of human PBL cells, the number of chromosome was determined first under different culture conditions. As shown in Fig.S1a-d and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100595-t001">Table 1</xref>, the total number of chromosomes did not show any significant change. G-banding technique and karyotype assay were used to further confirm whether there was any gain or loss of a whole chromosome. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100595-g001">Fig.1</xref>, there is no chromosome gain or loss of a whole chromosome. It can be seen from the research results that none of the culture conditions used for this study shows any effect on the chromosome segregation of human PBL cells, i.e. simulated microgravity has no effect on the numerical chromosome instability of human PBL cells. It can therefore be concluded that the numerical chromosome instability of human PBL cells is not enhanced by simulated microgravity.</p>

                <title>After the cells were kept in serum added 1640 medium under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, the chromosome fragile site does not occur but the expression of ATR is enhanced and the proliferation of cell is inhibited</title>
                <p>The structural chromosome instability of PBL cells was tested after the cells were kept in serum added 1640 medium under simulated microgravity for 72 hours. As shown in Fig.S1a and b, no chromosome breakpoint (chromosome fragile site) was observed, which meant that microgravity has no effect on the increase in the expression of chromosome fragile site of human PBL cells. However, no change was observed possibly because of the completed self-repair of a damaged cell. So, the expression of ATR, the arrestment of cell cycle and the change in mitotic index were further analyzed.</p>
                <p><italic>ATR</italic> is an important factor having effect on the DNA damage pathway, and it can be used to detect the occurrence of a gap during the replication of DNA <xref rid="pone.0100595-Casper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100595-Cha1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the up regulation of the expression to block the cell cycle and to complete the cell repair. Glover et al. (2005) confirmed that the expression of <italic>ATR</italic> is enhanced as the replication of DNA is inhibited, i.e., the breakpoints increase as the expression of <italic>ATR</italic> increases <xref rid="pone.0100595-Casper1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Eight PBL samples were taken from healthy male donors and cultured in serum added RPMI-1640. The cells were harvested after they were cultured under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, and quantitative real-time PCR was carried out as mentioned above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100595-g002">Fig.2</xref>, compared to untreated control, after being kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, the relative expressions of ATR in sample No.1â8 was 4.03, 1.76, 4.20, 1.25, 2.20, 0.26, 6.40, 1.07 times that of untreated control, respectively. This means that the expression of <italic>ATR</italic> increases in most of human beings, as the inhibition of DNA replication further increases. It was found in our early study that the cell cycle arrested at S phase in human immortalized lymphocytes after the cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours <xref rid="pone.0100595-Wei2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which proved from another angle that the synthesis of DNA had been inhibited. Mitotic index was analyzed to further confirm the inhibition of PBL cells proliferation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100595-g003">Fig.3</xref>, after the cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, the number of mitotic cells decreases significantly, which meant the cell proliferation was inhibited.</p>

                    <p>Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyze the expression of ATR, and the expression of ATR becomes more than 1.5 times larger in samples 1,2,3,5 and 7, and a slightly larger in samples 4 and 8, while smaller in sample 6 after the cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours. The expression of ATR increases in most of human beings. The relative expression rate in meanÂ± S.E. (nâ=â3).</p>

                <p>It can therefore be concluded that the inhibition of replication under simulated microgravity may cause the increase in the expression of cell cycle checkpoints to arrest the cell cycle, and to complete the repair of damage to DNA, and so, the chromosome fragile site can not be detected. After the cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, the structure of DNA could be damaged, but the damage could be repaired by the cell itself.</p>

                <title>Enhancement of expression rate of chromosome fragile site in conditioned medium under simulated microgravity</title>
                <p>A special culture medium or medicine was used to make the observation of chromosome breakages easy for the present study. The medium usually used for medical study is a folate-free M199 medium with low serum (5% of FBS) or RPMI-1640 with 20% FBS and aphidicolin, a medium with DNA replication inhibitor. The fragile site can be considered to be successfully induced when FRA3B is observed <xref rid="pone.0100595-Hecht1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0100595-Glover2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. And the presence of an expression of fragile site means the repair of DNA is below the actual damage degree of DNA. So, the inhibition of DNA replication can be identified through the observation of the change in chromosome morphological structure. This is the theoretical basis for our study on the effect of simulated microgravity on the replication of DNA and the structural chromosome instability of human PBL cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100595-g001">Fig.1c-d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100595-g004">Fig.4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0100595.s002">Table S1</xref>, the expression rate of chromosome fragile site had no significant difference among the three individuals, but it had a significant increase after the cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours. This meant simulated microgravity enhance the inhibition of DNA replication and induces the change in chromosome structure. It can be seen from the morphologic changes that more gaps occur in larger chromosomes.</p>

Compared with untreated control(ratio valueâ¥2.0 orâ¤0.5), the expressions of 208 genes showed significant changes, which include 119 genes up regulated and 89 genes down regulated. These genes are related to 49 pathways under simulated microgravity. Most noticeable pathways related to cell proliferation and DNA damage and repair (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) are tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100595-t002">Table 2</xref>. DNA replication- and repair- related genes were further analyzed to explain the relationship between the expression of gene and fragile site. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0100595-t003">Table 3</xref> that three genes <italic>P11388-2</italic>, <italic>TYMS</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic> with the functions of DNA replication and repair are down regulated. Six genes <italic>RFC2</italic>, <italic>GMNN</italic>, <italic>MCM7</italic>, <italic>FEN1</italic>, <italic>POLE3</italic> and <italic>GINS2</italic> with the function of DNA replication are down regulated, and DNA damage response gene <italic>BBC3</italic> is up regulated.</p>

                <p>It can be seen from the results above, that the replication of DNA is inhibited under simulated microgravity, but the response to DNA damage is enhanced, and the repair of DNA is reduced at the same time, which leads to the observable chromosome breakage, and the expression of chromosome fragile site. The expression rate of chromosome fragile site increases after the cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, and it is therefore believed that the structural chromosome instability of human PBL cells is enhanced under simulated microgravity.</p>

              <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0100595-g009">Fig.9</xref>, after the human PBL cells were kept under simulated microgravity for 72 hours in a RCCS bioreactor, 1) the number of chromosomes remains unchanged in different culture media, and no structural change can be detected in the serum added 1640 medium, but the expression of <italic>ATR</italic> in human PBL is enhanced together with the inhibition of cell proliferation; 2) the expression rate of chromosome fragile site is enhanced by inducing the chromosome fragile site with conditioned medium under simulated microgravity for 72 hours; 3) the expression of DNA replication and the DNA repair genes are both down regulated; and 4) the replication of DNA is inhibited, which enhances the structural chromosome instability of human PBL cells under simulated microgravity.</p>

              <p>It can therefore be concluded that simulated microgravity has no effect on the numerical chromosome instability of human PBL cells,but it enhances the structural chromosome instability of human PBL cells through the inhibition of DNA replication and the reduction of DNA repair. So, the mechanism of chromosome fragile site induced by simulated microgravity can be explained using the changes which occur in the chromosome structure of human PBL cells, the DNA replication and repair under simulated microgravity.</p>
