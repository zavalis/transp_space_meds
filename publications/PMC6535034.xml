              <abstract>
                <p>Long-duration spaceflight induces detrimental changes in human physiology. Its residual effects and mechanisms remain unclear. We prospectively investigated the changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume of the brain ventricular regions in space crew by means of a region of interest analysis on structural brain scans. Cosmonaut MRI data were investigated preflight (<italic>n</italic> = 11), postflight (<italic>n</italic> = 11), and at long-term follow-up 7 mo after landing (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between preflight and postflight values for all supratentorial ventricular structures, i.e., lateral ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 13.3 Â± 1.9), third ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 10.4 Â± 1.1), and the total ventricular volume (mean % change Â± SE = 11.6 Â± 1.5) (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with higher volumes at postflight. At follow-up, these structures did not quite reach baseline levels, with still residual increases in volume for the lateral ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 7.7 Â± 1.6; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009), the third ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 4.7 Â± 1.3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0063), and the total ventricular volume (mean % change Â± SE = 6.4 Â± 1.3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0008). This spatiotemporal pattern of CSF compartment enlargement and recovery points to a reduced CSF resorption in microgravity as the underlying cause. Our results warrant more detailed and longer longitudinal follow-up. The clinical impact of our findings on the long-term cosmonautsâ health and their relation to ocular changes reported in space travelers requires further prospective studies.</p>

            <p content-type="flushleft">Long-duration spaceflight is associated with several factors that can induce detrimental changes across many human physiological systems (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). An example hereof is the cephalic fluid shift that occurs immediately upon entering a microgravity environment because of the loss of hydrostatic pressures within the caudocranial fluid columns of the body (e.g., arterial and venous structures) (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It has been suggested that this fluid shift is associated with ocular and visual acuity changes, a clinical syndrome that has been coined Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and, more recently, redefined as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). VIIP or SANS has been reported to present with globe flattening, choroidal folds, optic disk edema, and a hyperopic visual shift (see refs. <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> for an overview), with a potential risk of permanent visual acuity changes (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The exact mechanisms underlying these visual changes related to long-duration spaceflight, however, are still unclear.</p>
            <p>Previous studies have observed a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment enlargement, including the subarachnoid space, directly after long-duration spaceflight (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, to date, no coherent imaging dataset and observer-independent analysis are available to quantify CSF volume changes longitudinally including a follow-up period longer than 1 mo after return to Earth.</p>
            <p>In this prospective study, we therefore aimed to assess and quantify ventricular volume changes in cosmonauts and matched controls on a group level by means of an observer-independent region-of-interest analysis of CSF spaces derived from structural MRI brain scans before, shortly after, and 7 mo after long-duration spaceflight. We compared these findings together with other published analyses to try to unravel the underlying dynamics in CSF compartment changes.</p>

Seven cosmonauts could be scanned again at a third time point (follow-up), on average, 7 mo after their initial return to Earth. The matched control group was scanned twice, with a space mission-matched time interval (on average, 235 d) in between the two time points, on the same scanner to test for potentially confounding aging processes and scanner signal drift over time.</p>

For each scan at each time point, a high-resolution sagittal T1-weighted 3D fast spoiled gradient echo image was acquired (repetition time 7.90 ms; echo time 3.06 ms; inversion time 450 ms; voxel size 1 Ã 1 Ã 1 mm; flip angle 12Â°; field of view 240 mm, 180 slices; bandwidth 31.25 Hz).

                <p>Data quality assurance (sample homogeneity), data preprocessing, and analysis were performed with the CAT12 toolbox (version 1363) by Christian Gaser and Robert Dahnke (Department of Psychiatry, University of Jena, Jena, Germany; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat" xlink:show="new">http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat</ext-link>) within the framework of Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM12 (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) (Version 7219) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/" xlink:show="new">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology), using Matlab R2017b (Mathworks). In addition to verifying sample homogeneity within the CAT12 toolbox, a separate quality analysis of the structural data to detect acquisition artifacts and excessive head motion during the structural scanning was performed using MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC) (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p>
                <p>The data were processed using the longitudinal preprocessing option of CAT12, where spatial normalization parameters are calculated using an average image of the two time points. This was again applied to the first and the second and third images. Afterward, we derived tissue volume estimation in native space using the ventricle regions of interest (ROIs) from the Neuromorphometric atlas (provided by Neuromorphometrics, Inc.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuromorphometrics.com" xlink:show="new">http://neuromorphometrics.com</ext-link>). In total, the three ROIs applicable to the CSF space were included: lateral ventricle (a sum of left and right), third ventricle, and fourth ventricle. In addition, the sum of all ventricular volumes was calculated, yielding a total ventricular CSF volume measurement. These ROIsâwhich are defined in MNI template spaceâwere transformed to native subject space for the actual volume calculations using the inverse nonlinear deformations needed to spatially normalize images to diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) template space with the geodesic shooting algorithm.</p>

                <p>In each of the 11 cosmonauts, visual acuity scores were acquired before launch and 3 d after return from space for each eye individually as part of a different study not in sync with the MRI acquisitions. All tests were conducted in the morning. Subjects were presented with Sivtsevâs tables using the Rotta apparatus at 5 m distance. A score of 1 represents the healthy population norm, with higher scores corresponding to better visual acuity. The difference in visual acuity score between preflight and postflight was calculated, rendering negative values for visual acuity decreases at postflight compared with preflight.</p>

                <title>Statistical Analysis.</title>
                <p>To test for differences in these regional brain ventricular volumes between the preflight, the postflight, and the follow-up measurements of the cosmonauts, we fitted a linear mixed model with time point as fixed effect and individual as random effect. In case the fixed effect of time was significant, a post hoc analysis with Tukey correction was carried out. Furthermore, we tested the interaction effect of group (cosmonauts and controls) and time (preflight and postflight) using linear mixed models. Group, time, and the interaction effect were set as fixed effects, while individual was set as random effect. A post hoc analysis was carried out if the interaction effect was significant, to look at which comparison(s) drove the significant interaction effect. An alpha level of 0.017 was used for the significance of the fixed effects, corrected for multiple testing. These statistical analyses were performed using JMP software (JMP, Version 13; SAS Institute Inc.).</p>
                <p>Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study samples. For the cosmonauts, the relationship between total brain ventricular volume change (preflight vs. postflight) and mission duration, age at launch, previous space experience, total intracranial volume, and change in visual acuity scores (preflight vs. postflight) was investigated by means of a nonparametric Kendallâs Tau correlation analysis. Also, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to statistically compare postflight with preflight visual acuity data for each eye separately. Finally, nonparametric MannâWhitney <italic>u</italic> tests were used to compare the differences in age and scan interval between the cosmonauts and matched controls. These statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 24.0 (IBM Corp.).</p>

              <p content-type="flushleft">Linear mixed model analysis revealed a significant effect of time on the ventricular volume measurements in the cosmonauts for the lateral ventricle, third ventricle, and total ventricular volume (all <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). There was no significant effect of time on the volume of the fourth ventricle for the cosmonauts.</p>
              <p>Post hoc analyses in the cosmonaut group revealed a significant difference between preflight and postflight values in the lateral ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 13.3 Â± 1.9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), third ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 10.4 Â± 1.1; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and total ventricular volume (mean % change Â± SE = 11.6 Â± 1.5; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with higher volumes at postflight. Comparison between postflight and follow-up showed a significant difference for the third ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = â5.7 Â± 0.4; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0002) and total ventricular volume (mean % change Â± SE = â3.9 Â± 1.0; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0104). Finally, comparison between preflight and follow-up revealed significant differences for the lateral ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 7.7 Â± 1.6; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009), the third ventricle (mean % change Â± SE = 4.7 Â± 1.3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0063), and total ventricular volume (mean % change Â± SE = 6.4 Â± 1.3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0008). These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, which shows the percentage volume difference for each ventricular compartment. In addition, the interaction effect of group and time was significant for the lateral ventricle (cosmonauts mean % change Â± SE = 13.3 Â± 1.9; controls mean % change Â± SE = â1.2 Â± 1.3; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001), third ventricle (cosmonauts mean % change Â± SE = 10.4 Â± 1.1; controls mean % change Â± SE = â0.6 Â± 0.9; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), fourth ventricle (cosmonauts mean % change Â± SE = 2.3 Â± 1.2; controls mean % change Â± SE = â2.0 Â± 1.0; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0102), and total ventricular volume (cosmonauts mean % change Â± SE = 11.6 Â± 1.5; controls mean % change Â± SE = â1.2 Â± 1.2; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Post hoc analyses revealed that the significant interaction effect was driven by the volume change between preflight and postflight measurements in cosmonauts for third, lateral, and total ventricular volume (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). For the fourth ventricle, none of the post hoc tests revealed significance.</p>

              <p content-type="flushleft">In summary, we found an increased ventricular CSF volume after spaceflight in supratentorial ventricular structures (i.e., lateral and the third ventricles), while the infratentorial fourth ventricle was not significantly enlarged. At follow-up, 7 mo after return from space, ventricular volume compared with preflight still had not completely returned to baseline levels, with still significant volume increases for the lateral and third ventricles. A schematic overview of our current findings together with previously established or observed CSF compartment changes can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>. Our results indicate that a longitudinal and homogeneous within-cohort approach seems to be the most sensitive to investigate the effects of long-term exposure to microgravity in humans.</p>

              <p>Previously, we reported alterations in total gray matter, white matter, and CSF tissue volumes after long-duration spaceflight (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). In addition, we found a progressive enlargement of the subarachnoid CSF space in cosmonauts after their return from space (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Another MRI study in ISS astronauts also observed a ventricular enlargement after spaceflight in combination with a narrowing of the central sulcus (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Upon visual inspection, the same study noted an upward brain shift in astronauts after long-duration spaceflight (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), a phenomenon that has also been described during head-down bed rest, a spaceflight analog (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This upward shift of the brain could lead to a compression of the superior sagittal sinus and Pachioniâs granulations, two structures responsible for the majority of CSF resorption (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Marginally elevated pressure levels in the cranial venous structures from the cephalad fluid shift or an obstruction at or near the superior sagittal sinus over longer periods of time could result in a generally reduced CSF resorption.</p>
              <p>We hypothesize that the impact we see on the supratentorial regions is an indicator for the structural compliance and CSF reserve capacity of these ventricles acting as buffers in healthy adults. This might be considered a preliminary coping mechanism in space that acts as an intermediate overflow zone for the reduced CSF resorption. Furthermore, a previous study by Kramer et al. (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) found that astronauts with an increased CSF maximum systolic velocity did not show visual symptoms, suggesting an increased craniospinal compliance in these astronauts and thus a potential ânegativeâ risk factor to VIIP. This could be attributed to a larger compensatory reserve capacity in CSF space [e.g., by a greater compliance and elasticity of the ventricles (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)] for the group of astronauts presenting without ophthalmic changes. This further suggests a potential link between these brain ventricular and CSF changes and VIIP/SANS symptoms. Furthermore, the hampered CSF resorption could subsequently lead to slightly elevated intracranial pressure akin to prodromal idiopathic intracranial hypertension and result in papilledema and loss of visual acuity (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), both known features of VIIP/SANS (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recently, a modeling study has suggested that VIIP/SANS symptoms are mainly caused by the upward brain shift (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and it has been put forward that CSF plays a primary role in the formation of VIIP (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Lastly, the periventricular white matter changes previously reported in astronauts (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) might be a direct consequence of transependymal water diffusion from the enlarged ventricles into periventricular structures, due to pressure peaks in a backed up CSF circulation.</p>
              <p>The previously reported and mentioned upward shift of the brain with or without a concurrent potential cerebral venous hypertension as a result of the cephalic fluid shift could be the underlying cause. Due to the overall restrictions to cosmonaut access, we were only able to conduct the postflight scan, on average, 10 d after return. Theoretically, the observed changes may already be partially reversed by the readaptation taking place immediately after landing back on Earth. We might therefore actually underestimate the degree to which CSF circulation might be perturbed. As such, an important gap in data collection the first few days after spaceflight currently remains. The exact temporal dynamics remain to be determined.</p>
              <p>Our correlation analysis between the visual acuity data and the CSF volume changes revealed an association of lateral ventricular volume changes with visual acuity difference in the left eye. The greater the ventricular expansion, the more visual acuity was decreased postflight. However, no statistically significant result was observed for any other ventricular compartment or for the visual acuity change in the right eye. Please note that the visual acuity data were acquired 1 wk earlier than the MRI scan. Unfortunately, visual acuity data were not available at follow-up. We strongly encourage future studies to follow up this probable link using a coherent dataset, additional supporting measurements, and a higher sample size.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we assessed whether the ventricular volume enlargement would return back to preflight baseline levels at a 7-mo follow-up time point. Here, our results indicate that the observed structural changes are indeed subject to a long, yet incomplete, recovery process as shown in our data. At the same time, we already know that VIIP/SANS also shows a long recovery time, as concluded by Mader et al (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). They found prolonged symptoms of VIIP and elevated intracranial pressure values in seven astronauts and a decline period of symptoms up to 19 mo after spaceflight (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Our current data corroborate these conclusions and suggest an overlap between brain ventricular volume changes and VIIP/SANS. In addition, one study has previously implemented a follow-up time point 1 mo after return from space for five astronauts (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Here, an increase in ventricular volume after spaceflight was also seen in a qualitative assessment, which also appeared to be only partially normalized after 1 mo (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The presented findings suggest the necessity for even longer follow-up intervals for neuroimaging data to reveal the complete course of the observed changes. We therefore see a need for a detailed neurological, ophthalmological, and neuroradiological evaluation from preflight to more than a year after landing for any long-duration space traveler, potentially in combination with inflight examinations (e.g., transtemporal and transocular ultrasound). A specific example hereof could be the assessment of CSF hydrodynamics by means of MRI, to quantify the physiological response to a long-term exposure to microgravity and to optimize countermeasures and risk mitigation for the potential clinical consequences of this phenomenon. In addition, risk factors, such as age, body mass index, head size, gender, CSF turnover rate, and craniospinal compliance (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), should be assessed to determine a specific individualâs likelihood to develop VIIP/SANS.</p>
              <p>In summary, our results warrant further and more detailed longitudinal follow-up on Earth, potentially in combination with inflight examinations, to determine the precise temporal dynamics of the observed circulatory changes in the CSF system and within the cerebral venous vasculature downstream. The clinical impact of our findings on the long-term cosmonautsâ health and their relation to VIIP/SANS requires further prospective studies. Determining the underlying cause and then identifying and applying countermeasures seems pivotal for space crew health and for the success of future interplanetary missions.</p>
