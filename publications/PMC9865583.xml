              <abstract>
                <p>During spaceflights, astronauts face different forms of stress (e.g., socio-environmental and gravity stresses) that impact physiological functions and particularly the immune system. In this context, little is known about the effect of such stress on dendritic cells (DCs). First, we showed that hypergravity, but not chronic ultra-mild stress, a socio-environmental stress, induced a less mature phenotype characterized by a decreased expression of MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules. Next, using the random positioning machine (RPM), we studied the direct effects of simulated microgravity on either splenic DCs or Flt-3L-differentiated bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs). Simulated microgravity was found to reduce the BM-conventional DC (cDC) and splenic cDC activation/maturation phenotype. Consistent with this, BMDCs displayed a decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines when exposed to microgravity compared to the normogravity condition. The induction of a more immature phenotype in microgravity than in control DCs correlated with an alteration of the NFκB signaling pathway. Since the DC phenotype is closely linked to their function, we studied the effects of microgravity on DCs and found that microgravity impaired their ability to induce naïve CD4 T cell survival, proliferation, and polarization. Thus, a deregulation of DC function is likely to induce immune deregulation, which could explain the reduced efficiency of astronauts’ immune response.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>During space missions, socio-environmental stresses and gravity changes affect many biological functions of astronauts, including the immune system. It has been shown that half of the astronauts who have spent six months on the International Space Station are prone to skin rashes, infections, and respiratory disorders such as rhinitis [<xref rid="B1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Numerous studies suggest that these alterations of the immune system could be explained by a lower efficiency of adaptive immunity. Indeed, mice sent into space exhibited an atrophy of lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus) linked to a lower number of lymphocytes [<xref rid="B2-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Innate immunity also appears to be affected by gravity changes, as suggested by studies showing that spaceflights disrupt neutrophil and monocyte functions [<xref rid="B3-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, some bacteria have increased pathogenicity and may become resistant to certain antibiotics during spaceflight [<xref rid="B4-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, latent viruses such as herpes, varicella, or cytomegalovirus reactivate in most astronauts while in space [<xref rid="B5-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These findings highlight the risks of pathology development during space missions.</p>
              <p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are a heterogeneous cell population that, in mice, can be divided, into two cell types: conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) specialized in the antiviral response. cDCs and pDCs are derived from a common precursor and their development is dependent on fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) [<xref rid="B7-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. GM-CSF (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor) is another important cytokine for DC development and has been widely used to differentiate DCs from bone marrow in vitro [<xref rid="B9-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Obtaining BMDCs (Bone Marrow-derived Dendritic Cells) in vitro by treating the cells with GM-CSF leads to the acquisition of an immunogenic phenotype [<xref rid="B10-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, differentiation of BMDCs with Flt-3L produces both cDCs and pDCs with a phenotype close to their in vivo steady state [<xref rid="B11-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Both cDC and pDC populations are of innate immunity and can orchestrate the adaptive immune response through the presentation of antigens and the secretion of cytokines to induce T cells activation. Immature mouse DCs show low levels of membrane expression of various co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80, CD86, and CD40, and of the Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHCII) [<xref rid="B12-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, they exhibit low migratory capabilities and high antigen capture and priming capacity [<xref rid="B13-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Through their membrane receptors of the PRR (Pattern Recognition Receptors) family, such as TLR (Toll-Like Receptor), they are able to recognize danger signals, which will activate different signaling pathways (ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, NFκB) that promote DC survival and activation/maturation. Upon activation/maturation, DCs acquire the ability to present antigen. This stage is characterized by an increase in the expression of MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules on their surface, a decrease in antigen priming capacity, and a rearrangement of adhesion molecules, allowing their migration [<xref rid="B12-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Once the antigen is exposed on the DC surface, it migrates to the lymph nodes for presentation to naive CD4 T cells. Depending on the presented antigen and the produced cytokines by DCs, naïve CD4 T cell polarization will either be directed toward immunogenic (e.g., Th1, Th2 or Th17) or tolerogenic (regulatory T cell: Treg) profiles [<xref rid="B14-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interestingly, immature DCs with low expression of MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40) and low production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, IP-10) have been shown to induce a tolerogenic response [<xref rid="B15-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, tolerogenic DCs can be characterized by the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) and the expression of tolerance markers (e.g., PDL1A, CTLA4) [<xref rid="B16-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, DCs play an essential role in maintaining immune system homeostasis, as well as that of the body, by regulating the balance between immunogenic and tolerogenic factors. </p>
              <p>Although DCs are at the center of the immune response, few studies have investigated the impact of spaceflight stresses on DCs. While studies on acute and chronic socio-environmental stresses showed that DCs are mainly modulated by stress hormones (e.g., corticosterone and catecholamine) [<xref rid="B17-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], data on the influence of gravity on DCs remain incomplete. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that gravity variations impact DCs’ differentiation, phagocytosis, cytokine production, survival, and immunogenicity [<xref rid="B19-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Human pDCs and cDCs development has been shown to be decreased under simulated microgravity conditions (21 days) [<xref rid="B19-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, Tackett and colleagues showed that under short-term simulated microgravity (&lt;72 h), JAWS II DCs from a murine cell line displayed an increased expression of MHCII and CD80, as well as IL-6 production associated with an increased ability to activate both CD4 and CD8 T cells [<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similar results were obtained in GM-CSF BMDCs with increased expression of MHCI, CD86, and CD40. Conversely, long-term exposure to microgravity (4–14 days) has the opposite effect [<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another study showed that the maturation phenotype of human DCs was affected by simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B24-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p>
              <p>Given the lack of knowledge on the effect of spaceflight stresses on DCs, we questioned whether DCs were sensitive to different kinds of stresses encountered during spaceflights, such as socio-environmental and gravity stresses. To investigate this, DCs were incubated with serum from mice exposed to different types of stress or exposed directly to simulated microgravity using the random positioning machine (RPM). Furthermore, we used either murine splenic DCs or Flt-3L-differentiated BMDCs, which display a phenotype close to the DCs’ in vivo steady state and allowed studying cDCs and pDCs. Our data revealed that gravity affects the DC maturation/activation phenotype only in the cDC population. These phenotype alterations lead to an impairment of DCs’ capacity to activate naïve CD4 T cells.</p>

                <title>2.1. Mechanical Stresses Affect Dendritic Cell Phenotype</title>
                <p>To evaluate the impact of different types of stress on the DC activation/maturation phenotype, splenic DCs were isolated and cultured during 24 h with serum from mice exposed to either mechanical (acute (3 h) or chronic (21 days)) hypergravity or socio-environmental (CUMS) stresses. Cells were then analyzed for the expression of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 using flow cytometry. Since two populations of cells were distinguishable for the expression of MHCII and CD86 at high or low levels, positive populations were separated following the expression level of the respective marker. We observed that CUMS did not affect the DC phenotype (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A), in contrast to acute hypergravity stress and, to a lesser extent, chronic hypergravity stress (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,C). Indeed, DCs exposed to serum from mice subjected to 3 h of hypergravity expressed lower levels of MHCII, CD86, and CD40 than their 1G counterparts (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Twenty-one days of hypergravity resulted in a slightly decreased expression of MHCII (tendency <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0687) and CD86, while no change was detected in CD40 expression (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>C). Thus, these results showed that hypergravity impairs the DC activation/maturation phenotype.</p>
                <p>Because stress hormone secretion, such as that of corticosterone, is known to inhibit immune cells and to compromise DC maturation [<xref rid="B18-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we analyzed corticosterone’s concentration in mice serums. As shown <xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D, only acute hypergravity-stressed mice showed increased levels of corticosterone compared to control mice. </p>
                <p>Together, these results suggest that corticosterone may not be responsible for the decreased DC activation/maturation phenotype observed in DCs treated with serums issued from mice submitted to acute or chronic hypergravity stress.</p>

                <title>2.2. Simulated Microgravity Impairs cDC but Not pDC Activation/Maturation Phenotype</title>
                <p>Since many factors present in the serum from mice submitted to hypergravity could be responsible for the decreased DC maturation phenotype, we used the RPM, a system that allows the study of the gravity changes on DCs in the absence of any influence of the serum environment. To do so, BMDCs differentiated for 7 days with Flt3L or splenic DCs were cultured for 24 h in simulated microgravity and activated with LPS. The same parameters from the previous experiment were studied, as well as the co-stimulatory molecule CD80. </p>
                <p>We first showed that, after microgravity exposure, Flt3L-differentiated BMDCs expressed lower levels of the different markers, compared to the 1G condition, consistent with the in vivo studies (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1A</xref>). Thus, we found that microgravity affected CD40 expression, not only as the percentage of cells expressing CD40 (3.8% in µG vs. 8.4% in 1G) (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A upper panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1A</xref>), but also with respect to intensity of expression per cell (8% less than control) (MFI, <xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A lower panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1A</xref>), as compared to 1G BMDCs. While no difference was found for the proportion of inactivated cells expressing MHCII and CD86, their MFI ratios were lower in BMDCs submitted to microgravity than in 1G BMDCs (23% decrease for MHCII and 30% for CD86) (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A lower panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1A</xref>). After activation with LPS, BMDCs presented a phenotype comparable to that of their 1G counterpart, with an even higher level of MHCII and CD40 expression intensity (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A lower right panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1A</xref>). </p>
                <p>These results led us to characterize BM-cDCs and BM-pDCs in more detail. BM-cDCs subjected to simulated microgravity displayed a more immature phenotype than that of 1G BM-cDCs, as indicated by the lower percentage of cells expressing CD40 (2.6% in µG compared to 8% in 1G) and CD80 (4.5% in µG vs. 6.6% in 1G) (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B left upper panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1B</xref>) and by the lower MFI ratios of all studied markers (decreases of 22%, 17%, 17% and 29% for MHCII, CD40, CD80, and CD86, respectively) (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B left lower panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1B</xref>). No phenotype changes following microgravity were observed in BM-pDCs (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B right panel and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1B</xref>). Thus, these results showed that BM-cDCs, but not BM-pDCs, were sensitive to microgravity.</p>
                <p>To confirm the impact of simulated microgravity on cDCs, we then repeated these experiments using splenic cDCs. Simulated microgravity altered the percentage of cells expressing the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 (6.6% for µG vs. 12.8% for 1G) and CD80 (19.5% in µG vs. 29.8% in 1G) (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1C</xref>), as well as the intensity of CD80 and CD86 expression (decreases of 16% and 32%, respectively), compared to control cells. Upon activation, the percentage of splenic DCs expressing MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules reached expression equivalent to that of 1G cells. However, cell activation with LPS failed to restore the expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules to control levels (decreases of 23%, 27% and 43% for CD40, CD80, and CD86, respectively), as indicated by MFI ratios (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Figure S1C</xref>). These results confirm that microgravity interfered with the DC activation/maturation phenotype and that, particularly for splenic DCs, this immature phenotype was maintained despite cell activation. </p>
                <p>Altogether, our results demonstrated that microgravity rendered Flt3L-differentiated BMDCs and splenic DCs less mature than cells cultured upon the 1G condition and that cDC was the microgravity-sensitive DC population.</p>

                <p>We then quantified IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12β, and IP-10 pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts. As shown in <xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A, microgravity interfered with all tested cytokine production in both non-activated and LPS-activated BMDCs, compared to 1G cells, except for IL-1β transcripts that were only affected in inactivated cells.

In activated BMDCs, microgravity decreased by 32%, 18%, and 55% of IL-6, IL-12β, and IP-10, respectively.</p>
                <p>Since an immature DC phenotype and a lower pro-inflammatory cytokine production could result in a tolerogenic DC profile [<xref rid="B16-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we evaluated tolerogenic marker expression using flow cytometry. We showed that neither CTLA4 nor PDL1A were upregulated under a simulated microgravity condition (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) in BMDCs, compared to control cells. PDLA1 expression was even lower in LPS-activated BMDCs (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) subjected to microgravity than in 1G BMDCs. </p>
                <p>Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that simulated microgravity altered DCs’ ability to activate/maturate through the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression, but without inducing tolerogenic marker expression.</p>

                <p>In order to understand how simulated microgravity downregulates DC maturation markers, we next studied different signaling pathways that have been described to play a role in DC maturation and to be disturbed by gravity changes [<xref rid="B25-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For this, Flt3L-differenciated BMDCs were submitted to simulated microgravity for 24h and then activated with LPS for 15 to 60 min. We first studied the MAPK pathway by measuring ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation in whole-cell extract by Western blot. Interestingly, none of these pathways was downregulated following microgravity exposure (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A,B). ERK1/2 phosphorylation was even found to be higher after 15 min of LPS activation in µG, compared to 1G BMDCs. </p>
                <p>We then assessed the effect of microgravity on the NFκB signaling pathway. Indeed, NFκB has been described for its essential role in the acquisition of the DC matured phenotype and particularly in the regulation of CD80 [<xref rid="B26-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, such as IL-6 and IL-12 [<xref rid="B26-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the NFκB signaling pathway has been shown to be dysregulated by gravity modifications in different cell types, such as T cells and macrophages [<xref rid="B28-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To study this pathway, we used the same approach as was used for the MAPK pathway, but we followed p50 nuclear translocation as a marker of its activation. As shown <xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C,D, p50 translocation was diminished in BMDCs exposed to microgravity after 15 and 30 min compared to 1G cells.</p>

                <title>2.5. Simulated Microgravity Alters DC Function to Induce Naïve CD4 T Cell Survival, Proliferation and Polarization</title>
                <p>DCs need to express high levels of MHCII and CD40, CD80, and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules to mount an effective CD4 T-cell response. Indeed, productive engagement of the naïve CD4 T cell TCR leads to the delivery of signals required for their proliferation, their survival, and their differentiation into effector cells [<xref rid="B30-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because our results showed that simulated microgravity contributed to the emergence of a reduced pro-inflammatory profile in DCs, we next sought to determine whether simulated microgravity affects DC function. To do this, splenic DCs were exposed to simulated microgravity for 24h and stimulated with LPS. DCs were then pulsed with either ova<sub>323-339</sub> peptide or full-length protein and cultivated with OTII naive CD4 T cells for 3 or 4 days to assess their proliferation and polarization, respectively. Both full-length protein and ova<sub>323-339</sub> peptide were used to discriminate between a putative effect of simulated microgravity in DCs’ antigen processing/presentation processes or in their reduced inflammatory state. Survival of CD4 T cells was reduced when non-activated DCs were exposed to simulated microgravity prior to CD4 T cell activation, whether they were pulsed with ova<sub>323-339</sub> (8%) or full-length protein (14%), respectively (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B). CD4 T-cell survival was slightly decreased when DCs were activated with LPS and pulsed with ova full-length protein, but not when pulsed with the peptide (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>A,B). </p>
                <p>The reduced proliferation and division indices, compared to control conditions, demonstrated that CD4 T-cell proliferation was impaired when CD4 T cells were activated with DCs exposed for 24 h to microgravity, consistent with cell survival (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C–F). Indeed, CD4 T-cell proliferation and division indices were reduced by approximately 10% and 20%, respectively, when non-activated or LPS-activated ova<sub>323-339-</sub>pulsed DCs were used to stimulate CD4 T cells in the µG, compared to the 1G condition (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C,E). These results showed that less CD4 T cells can proliferate and those that enter into division proliferate less. Comparable results were obtained under the µG condition using full-length ovalbumin to pulse DCs with proliferation and division indices reduced by approximately 10% and 40%, respectively, compared to the 1G condition (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D,F). Under these conditions, no differences were found when LPS-activated DCs were used to stimulate naïve CD4 T cells (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D,F). </p>
                <p>We then investigated the ability of microgravity-exposed DCs to polarize naïve CD4 T cells through Th1, Th2, Th17, or Treg. As shown in <xref rid="app1-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>, ova<sub>323-339-</sub>pulsed DCs polarized mainly naïve CD4 T cells toward Th1 effector cells characterized by the production of IFNγ. Our results revealed that both activated and non-activated DCs pulsed with ova<sub>323-339</sub> showed an approximately 20–25% reduced ability to polarize naïve CD4 T cells toward Th1, compared to DCs cultivated in 1G (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A,C). Although the induction of Th1 cells was less effective, a reduced percentage of about 25% of Th1 cells was obtained when DCs were pulsed with the ovalbumin protein (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B,D), compared to their 1G counterpart. As for proliferation, no differences were found between µG and 1G conditions when LPS-activated DCs were used to stimulate naïve CD4 T cells (<xref rid="ijms-24-01720-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>B,D).</p>
                <p>Taken together, these data demonstrate the microgravity-impaired DCs’ capacity to activate naïve CD4 T cells, leading to a reduction in their capacity to survive, to proliferate, and to polarize toward a pro-inflammatory profile. </p>

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>Different forms of stress encountered during spaceflight are known to alter the immune system, but little is known about their effects on DCs [<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we showed, in vitro, using serum from mice exposed to different stresses, that DCs are sensitive to both acute and chronic hypergravity stresses but not to CUMS, which is a form of socio-environmental stress. Indeed, only serums from mice submitted to hypergravity induced a lower expression of DC activation/maturation markers, such as MHCII, CD40, and CD86, compared to their control counterparts. Stresses are known to induce, via the HPA axis activation, the release of glucocorticoids from which corticosterone has been described to have anti-inflammatory effects on immune cells [<xref rid="B31-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, to explain our results, we measured corticosterone levels in mice serums obtained following exposure to different forms of stress. The corticosterone level was increased only in serums from mice subjected to acute hypergravity stress. These results are consistent with those showing that neither CUMS nor chronic hypergravity stresses displayed an elevated corticosterone level in mouse serum after 21 days of stress [<xref rid="B32-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While this result could explain the lack of effect of serums from CUMS-stressed mice on the DC phenotype, corticosterone is most likely not responsible for the more immature DC phenotype exposed to serum from mice under chronic hypergravity stress. Nevertheless, it is possible that the increased corticosterone levels in serum from mice submitted to acute hypergravity stress could explain the greater decrease in the expression of maturation/activation markers in DCs exposed to those serums [<xref rid="B34-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p>
              <p>Together, these results demonstrated that the immature phenotype of splenic DCs exposed to serum from acute and chronic hypergravity stressed mice was not due to corticosterone-inducing DC inhibition. </p>
              <p>In order to further investigate the effects of gravity changes on DCs’ fate, we then used the RPM, a system that allows applying microgravity directly to the cell culture in absence of any influence of the in vivo environment. Thus, we tested the effects of simulated microgravity on bone marrow Flt3L-differentiated DCs and splenic DCs activated by LPS treatment. We showed that non-matured BMDCs exposed to microgravity during 24h exhibited a more immature phenotype, compared to the control BMDCs. These results correlated with an impaired ability of BMDCs to express pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts (IL-6, IL-1β, IP10 and IL-12). We also demonstrated that microgravity affected BM-cDCs, but not BM-pDCs of the BMDC population, while it has previously been shown to impair both cDC and pDC development [<xref rid="B19-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, once differentiated, BM-pDCs appeared to be insensitive to microgravity. </p>
              <p>Upon activation/maturation with LPS, BMDCs displayed a phenotype comparable to the 1G control for the expression levels of CD80 and CD86 and more activated for the expression levels of MHCII and CD40. Thus, microgravity did not impair the BMDCs’ ability to upregulate the expression of their activation markers. Interestingly, in these cells, even if the cytokine production was still decreased, compared to the 1G control except for IL-1β, differences were less important than in non-stimulated BMDCs. Thus, increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines following BMDC activation may have enabled the phenotype recovery of BMDCs exposed to microgravity. Indeed, it has been shown that IL-1β induces expression of co-stimulatory molecules in dendritic cells [<xref rid="B35-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To analyze BM-pDCs vs. BM-cDCs we used an anti-mPDCA1 antibody that did not allow us to analyze which population from BM-cDCs or BM-pDCs displayed a more activated phenotype after microgravity exposure. Indeed, this marker expression is upregulated after cell activation in different cell types, such as cDCs [<xref rid="B36-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Similar treatments of splenic cDCs confirmed that microgravity led to a decreased expression of the co-stimulatory molecules on their surface but without changes in MHCII expression. Interestingly, splenic cDC activation with LPS did not restore the same expression level of the co-stimulatory molecules as the DCs cultured in 1G condition. </p>
              <p>Together, these results demonstrate that microgravity exposure led to a more immature phenotype correlated with lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, two characteristics of tolerogenic DCs. The assessment of tolerogenic marker expression, however, showed that neither CTLA-4 nor PDL1A expression was upregulated under microgravity. PDL1A expression was even reduced in stimulated BMDCs. </p>
              <p>Although the MAP kinase p38 and JNK pathways were unchanged, those of ERK1/2 and NFκB were modified by microgravity. Interestingly, as was shown in the Jurkat T cell line, microgravity led to enhanced phosphorylation of the MAP kinase ERK1/2 and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NFκB [<xref rid="B37-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These pathways have been described as important during the activation/maturation process of DCs and/or during spaceflight [<xref rid="B16-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In addition, studies on mouse macrophages have shown an alteration of the activation of the RAS, ERK, and NFκB pathways, preventing their differentiation after exposure to both spaceflight and simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B29-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The exacerbation of the ERK1/2 pathway activation found in BMDCs exposed to microgravity could be related to their more immature state. Indeed, it has been shown that the ERK1/2 pathway is more sensitive to activation in immaturely blocked DCs [<xref rid="B26-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The observed decrease of the maturation phenotype, as well as the limited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by microgravity in BMDCs, is therefore not related to a decrease in MAPK activation, but rather to the impaired nuclear translocation of NFκB. While the NFκB pathway seemed to be only transiently altered, these minor changes can completely modify the cell response through the dynamics of gene expression [<xref rid="B38-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, since PDL1A expression is also dependent on this signaling pathway, it could also explain its lowered expression following LPS activation/maturation of BMDCs [<xref rid="B40-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
              <p>The capacity of DCs to induce either immunity or tolerance is largely determined by their activation state [<xref rid="B41-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Given our results on the DC phenotype, we expected that simulated microgravity could impact their function. Indeed, naive T-cell activation is known to require three signals. Signal 1 corresponds to T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of the antigen/MHC complex while signal 2 involves the co-stimulatory molecules. Finally, signal 3, determined by the cytokine environment, guides T-cell differentiation and proliferation. It is well established that a lack of co-stimulation following TCR activation leads to T-cell anergy and/or tolerance [<xref rid="B43-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Indeed, signal 2 leads through the interaction of CD28 and its ligands CD80 and CD86 to the diminution of the TCR signal threshold and enhances cytokine production proliferation and survival [<xref rid="B45-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Consistent with the production of inflammatory cytokines, our polarization assay demonstrated that DCs polarize mainly naïve CD4 T cells toward a Th1 profile, whether or not the DCs are activated or exposed to microgravity [<xref rid="B46-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, DCs exposed to microgravity were poorer activators of naïve CD4 T cells, compared to 1G cells. Indeed, we found a decreased survival, proliferation, and Th1 polarization when DCs were submitted to simulated microgravity prior to the co-culture with naïve CD4 T cells. This process seems to be independent of the internalization and priming of ovalbumin, since similar results were observed when DCs were cultured in the presence of ova<sub>323-339</sub>. However, we note that naïve CD4 T cell activation with ovalbumin was weaker than with ova<sub>323-339</sub>, as demonstrated by the lower CD4 T-cell survival, proliferation, and Th1 percentage. In agreement with this, it has been shown that the DC process of whole proteins reduces antigen presentation and T-cell activation, compared to peptide processing [<xref rid="B47-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. </p>
              <p>Taken together, our data therefore suggest that the less-efficient T-cells activation by microgravity-exposed DCs would be related to their immature phenotype and could be associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines production. </p>
              <p>Although our results are in agreement with the study of Savary et al., which showed that simulated microgravity impaired the human DC phenotype and function, our results vary from those of Tackett et al. [<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Indeed, while Tackett and colleagues demonstrated that microgravity has different effects depending on the duration of microgravity exposure (immunogenic for short time periods or tolerogenic for long time periods), we showed that short-time exposure to microgravity (24 h) led to a decrease of the DC maturation phenotype and function. Furthermore, we report that DCs respond slightly differently whether they are immature, in steady state or activated. Such dichotomy between the results of the study of Tackett et al. and our study could be explained by various experimental parameters, such as the cell population used (GMCSF-differentiated BMDCs and the JAWII cell line vs. FLT3-differentiated BMDCs and splenic cDCs), the type of stimulation (a cocktail containing IFN-γ, IL-4, and TNFα vs. LPS), and the use of beads to allow cell anchorage vs. no use of beads [<xref rid="B23-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. </p>
              <p>In conclusion, our results bring a better understanding of simulated microgravity effects on DCs’ fate, and complete the few existing data in this field. Indeed, we demonstrated for the first time that simulated microgravity preferentially targets cDCs and BM-cDCs. However, further investigations would be necessary to complete the understanding of the effects of microgravity on pDCs. Indeed, this population study is essential in the context of virus reactivation observed during spaceflight [<xref rid="B5-ijms-24-01720" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Using our parameters allowed us to demonstrate that the alteration of the DC maturation phenotype by microgravity ended in a less efficient activation of naïve CD4 T cells, which could be a major issue in the context of longer spaceflights, as well as in the opening of spaceflights to a larger population of astronauts.</p>

If these parameters were validated, a t-test or a Mann–Whitney test was carried out. For more than two groups, normality and variance homogeneity were checked using Shapiro–Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. ANOVA tests followed by post hoc Tukey–Kramer tests for two-by-two comparisons were performed. Results were considered significant at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> values &lt; 0.05. Histograms are shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Box plots are shown as the median percent extended from the 25th to the 75th percentile and whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum.</p>

                <p>Acute and chronic hypergravity stresses affect the splenic DC phenotype independently of glucocorticoid level. (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Splenic DCs were isolated from mice and cultured for 24h with serum from control mice (CT) or mice exposed to CUMS (CUMS) (<bold>A</bold>), chronic (<bold>B</bold>), or acute hypergravity (<bold>C</bold>) stresses. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of MHCII, CD86, and CD40. Representative FACS histograms are shown of populations that express either total or low/high levels of the related marker (left panel), and box plots are shown of the median percent of CD11C gated cells expressing MHCII, CD86, or CD40 (right panel). The boxes extend from the 25th to the 75th percentile; whiskers indicate the minimum and maximum. Data are from one experiment with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3 serums/group (<bold>A</bold>), three independent experiments with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3 serums/group/experiment (<bold>B</bold>), and two independent experiments with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3 serums/group/experiment (<bold>C</bold>). (<bold>D</bold>) Mean ± SEM of corticosterone levels measured by ELISA in serum from mice submitted to chronic (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 8) or acute (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3) hypergravity or CUMS (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 3) stresses. <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test, Mann–Whitney, or ANOVA tests were used to reveal statistically significant differences. * <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, t indicates a tendency.</p>
