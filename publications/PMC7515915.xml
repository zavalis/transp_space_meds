                <p id="Par1">Lunar habitation and exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit will require small crews to live in isolation and confinement while maintaining a high level of performance with limited support from mission control. Astronauts only achieve approximately 6 h of sleep per night, but few studies have linked sleep deficiency in space to performance impairment. We studied crewmembers over 45 days during a simulated space mission that included 5 h of sleep opportunity on weekdays and 8 h of sleep on weekends to characterize changes in performance on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and subjective fatigue ratings. We further evaluated how well bio-mathematical models designed to predict performance changes due to sleep loss compared to objective performance. We studied 20 individuals during five missions and found that objective performance, but not subjective fatigue, declined from the beginning to the end of the mission. We found that bio-mathematical models were able to predict average changes across the mission but were less sensitive at predicting individual-level performance. Our findings suggest that sleep should be prioritized in lunar crews to minimize the potential for performance errors. Bio-mathematical models may be useful for aiding crews in schedule design but not for individual-level fitness-for-duty decisions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par2">Lunar habitation and exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit poses many challenges. Lunar crews are likely to be comprised of small groups of individuals living in confined spaces for more than a month at a time, and mission support personnel may not be consistently available to assist crewmembers due to communication delays (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artemis">https://www.nasa.gov/what-is-artemis</ext-link>). Prior spaceflight missions have established that crewmembers achieve less than the recommended number of hours of sleep per night on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>; however, few studies have been conducted to determine how the reduced sleep duration observed in space may relate to performance changes among rigorously selected individuals who may be intrinsically motivated to perform at a high level. Furthermore, it is unclear whether bio-mathematical models that are used to design work schedules on Earth would provide performance predictions consistent with actual performance during a spaceflight mission. If such models can accurately predict performance changes among crew during spaceflight, they could be used to allow crew to self-schedule activities around periods of cognitive vulnerability, potentially minimizing the reliance of crewmembers on mission control oversight.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Several studies have shown that astronauts achieve approximately 6 h of sleep per night while in space, but are able to sleep longer when on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, suggesting that crewmembers accumulate a sleep deficit while in space. The few studies evaluating cognitive performance changes during spaceflight are mixed, with six studies including 23 crewmembers finding that inflight performance is reduced relative to on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and three studies including six crewmembers that did not find changes in performance during spaceflight missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These studies are limited by low sample size, few data collection points during a mission, and varying mission durations and schedules, making it difficult to interpret whether sleep loss could relate to the changes in performance observed in some studies.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Astronauts are a self-selected group of highly motivated individuals. Several studies have demonstrated that motivation can attenuate the cognitive declines that arise as a result of sleep deprivation over short durations of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, most studies have investigated responses to extrinsic motivators over acute sleep deprivation (i.e., when financial incentives were given to participants), which may not be consistent with the influence of intrinsic motivation (i.e., astronauts driven to succeed in a mission)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Intrinsic motivation is modulated according to time awake and circadian phase, with a peak in motivation occurring during the biological day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that individuals who are working during the day and only modestly sleep deprived may be able to overcome some performance impairment when they are intrinsically motivated to perform well. Given the mixed findings on measures of performance during spaceflight, it remains unclear whether individuals selected to be astronauts can maintain performance over the course of a mission via intrinsic motivation alone to succeed even when sleep restricted.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Several spaceflight simulations have been conducted previously; however, the study schedules for most prior spaceflight simulations were not designed to evaluate the performance of crewmembers during sleep restriction. For example, two Mars mission simulations lasting 105 and 520 days showed that crewmembers experienced reduced performance throughout the missions, but crewmembers received 8-h sleep opportunities on most days and both crews averaged over 7 h of sleep per night during those missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that even modest sleep loss affects performance among rigorously selected individuals, yet it is unclear how shorter mission durations, such as those that are consistent with what astronauts will experience during lunar exploration, might influence performance.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Earth-based studies of young, healthy individuals suggest that there is a dose-response relationship between sleep loss and performance, in that there is an immediate progressive reduction in performance with every day of sleep less than 8 h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, such studies find that people are unable to estimate the magnitude of their performance impairment on average after several days of sleep restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This means that individuals experiencing chronic sleep restriction do not recognize that they are performing poorly. In operational environments where there are few individuals available to complete tasks and where individuals are highly motivated, this disconnect could increase the potential for an operational error.</p>
              <p id="Par7">The mismatch between how individuals feel and how they perform has been recognized in many safety-sensitive industries. For example, in aviation operations, pilots are required to self-report that they are fit-for-duty, but this self-report is supplemented by schedule optimization using bio-mathematical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These models are used by scheduling personnel to identify schedules that would place individuals at work during a vulnerable period, when sleep loss and circadian misalignment may cause performance degradation. It is conceivable that such models could be used by astronauts to self-schedule tasks, thereby avoiding the need to rely on operational personnel to monitor crew and reassign tasks. Given the uncertainties associated with how highly-motivated individuals perform during sleep restriction, it is unclear whether currently available models would be appropriate for this purpose.</p>
              <p id="Par8">Considering the lack of information on how crewmembers may be expected to perform during moderate-duration lunar missions, we aimed to determine how rigorously selected, astronaut-like individuals participating in a simulated spaceflight mission would perform during chronic sleep restriction. We further aimed to evaluate how well bio-mathematical models designed to predict performance changes due to sleepiness would correlate with actual performance in an operational environment.</p>

Crewmembers were monitored continuously by a simulated mission control to ensure their health and well-being. All activities were prescheduled and included simulated operational tasks, such as extra vehicular activities, robotic arm manoeuvres, and science activities. The crew were not required to follow any specific sleep schedule prior to entering the habitat. During the 2 weeks prior to the mission, participants completed a sleep diary that was used to estimate pre-study sleep duration. During the mission, crewmembers were scheduled for 5 h of sleep during the week (5 nights) and 8 h of sleep on the weekends (2 nights; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Napping was not allowed during the protocol and crewmembers were monitored by mission control staff to verify their adherence to study procedures. Caffeine was only allowed between 07:45 and 14:00 h. Timing and amount of caffeine consumption was not documented.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Study schematic for the 45-day protocol. Gray bars indicate schedule sleep.

                  <title>Scaling procedures</title>
                  <p id="Par19">A challenge in comparing model predictions to actual performance measures is that the model outputs differ from the objective metrics available for comparison. For example, the SAFTE model, which outputs the proprietary measure “cognitive effectiveness,” could be compared to objective data, but the results of such a comparison would not be on the same scale as the other models, making it impossible to compare the model predictions to one another. In addition, although we used PVT data to assess waking performance, we used a 5-min version of the PVT. The PVT lapse predictions for each model are based on a 10-min test. As a result, comparisons between the model predictions and actual data produced by crewmembers was expected to yield consistent overestimation of PVT lapses relative to actual lapses. Due to all of these factors, we used a least-squares-optimal scaling approach to scale the model outputs relative to the data as described by Van Dongen, using PROC NLMIXED in SAS (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

These means and confidence limits can be compared to determine under which conditions (time or sleep schedule) the models predict closer or further from the observed.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par35">We found that rigorously selected, astronaut-like individuals experienced a progressive reduction in performance over the course of a simulated space mission that included chronic sleep restriction. Crewmembers also performed worse on days following 5 h of sleep relative to days following 8 h of sleep. In our comparison of four bio-mathematical models relative to actual in-mission performance, we found that all the models were able to capture relative changes in performance by day of mission and by session of the day but performed less well at capturing the differences in performance over days following 5 h of sleep. Although the models performed similarly to one another, they were only weakly correlated to the observed data according to our goodness of fit assessments. Our findings have implications for future space missions and for other occupations comprised of rigorously selected populations that must maintain a high level of performance despite persistent chronic sleep restriction.</p>
              <p id="Par36">Our findings suggest that simply meeting the criteria required to be an astronaut is not in itself a determinant of resilience to chronic sleep restriction. This finding is consistent with data from populations of high-performing professionals such as physicians, airline pilots, and special operations military units, who are often required to work extended-duty work shifts that limit sleep opportunity, resulting in performance impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The population of rigorously selected individuals that we studied exhibited performance impairment over the course of a 45-day simulated space mission on average. Notably, there were large individual differences in tolerance to the sleep restriction schedule, with some crewmembers performing well throughout the mission and with others exhibiting concerning levels of performance impairment within the first week of the mission. Some of the crewmembers reported short sleep duration pre-mission, which may explain why some individuals exhibited poor performance early in the study. Given that the crew were only afforded 8 h of sleep opportunity during their “long” sleep nights, it is likely that those who were sleep deprived at baseline never had the opportunity to recover during the mission where they accumulated further sleep debt.</p>
              <p id="Par37">Interindividual differences in tolerance or vulnerability to sleep loss have been found in other laboratory and field studies, including fighter pilots and public safety workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Further research is needed to determine whether these differences in performance relate to differences in intrinsic motivation, differences in sleep need, or resilience to sleep loss. Despite the overall change in performance that we observed over the course of the mission, we did not observe differences in Samn Perelli fatigue ratings. Crewmembers rarely rated themselves as completely exhausted (SP rating of 7), but they did rate themselves as relatively more fatigued following nights with 5 h of sleep relative to nights with 8 h of sleep. Such discrepancies between subjective and objective measures of sleepiness have been documented in other settings, including long-haul international aircrew<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Our findings suggest that it is important to evaluate individuals in safety sensitive occupations using objective measures of performance in order to determine how an individual is affected by sleep loss.</p>
              <p id="Par38">NASA plans to send astronauts to orbit the Moon by 2022, with the first lunar exploration mission to occur in 2024. During these missions, crewmembers will be exposed to a high-tempo workflow involving challenging mental and physical workload while establishing the lunar Gateway and habitats. As a result, it is critical that crewmembers maintain alertness and cognitive performance during all phases of these missions. Crewmembers average approximately 6 h of sleep during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, but there have been few attempts to characterize changes in performance that may accompany the short sleep duration that astronauts experience in space. In two case studies of cosmonauts, and in one study of four astronauts, no significant decrements in performance were observed during short-duration missions relative to ground-based measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In contrast, two separate studies aboard the Space Shuttle (of three and five astronauts) found that crewmembers experienced impaired performance during spaceflight, changes which the authors attributed to fatigue and sleep loss among the crew<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. More recent evidence of performance impairment during spaceflight suggest that such changes may relate to a global increase in local sleep-like events during spaceflight compared to on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, providing evidence for a relationship between sleep deficiency and performance impairment during spaceflight. Although our data were collected in a spaceflight analogue environment, they suggest that sleep loss during future space missions can be expected to impair performance even among a rigorously selected crew.</p>
              <p id="Par39">NASA currently provides crewmembers with an 8-h sleep opportunity during spaceflight missions, yet crew still average 6 h of sleep per night. It may be necessary to provide crew with additional tools to promote longer sleep, such as providing crew with stable schedules to minimize circadian misalignment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and sleep quarters that minimize environmental disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. If such measures are insufficient for extending crew sleep, then countermeasures such as scheduled napping, strategic use of caffeine, and other alertness and sleep-promoting medications may be necessary to ensure the crew are fit for duty. Bio-mathematical models may provide some utility in helping crewmembers determine when to use such countermeasures.</p>
              <p id="Par40">In our comparisons, we found that all of the models performed similarly to one another, suggesting that no single model is superior to the others. We found that all models appeared to be able to predict group-average performance by day of the mission and by session of the day on average. When we examined session of the day by prior night’s sleep duration (8-h vs. 5-h), we found that the observed performance was worse midday and before bed relative to the model predictions following 5 h of sleep. The worse performance that we observed during the midday session could relate to a metabolic response following lunch (the so-called ‘post-lunch dip’)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. It is also possible that this poorer performance relates to the cessation of caffeine, which crewmembers were not allowed to use after 14:00 h. None of the models include information on how metabolism may influence performance. Only the Unified Model of Performance allows for the input of caffeine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, but the timing and amount of caffeine use during the mission was not recorded in a way that we could include in the model. It is likely that the predictions of the Unified model would be improved with the addition of such information. The poorer performance exhibited by the participants at the end of the day may relate to the build-up of chronic sleep restriction over time, potentially interacting with the circadian rhythm promoting sleepiness. This is consistent with the findings of St. Hilaire et al. (2016), who evaluated the same models and showed that none of the models were able to capture the accumulation of chronic sleep debt that accrued over three cycles of two nights with 3 h of sleep followed by a 10-h recovery night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although, in that study, the models consistently underestimated performance at all points during the day on the second day of the third cycle of sleep restriction (i.e., the average performance in St. Hilaire et al. was much worse than what we observed). It is possible that these differences stem from the differences in the sleep opportunities afforded to participants in our studies (3 h for 2 nights/10 h recovery for 1 night vs. 5 h for 5 nights/8 h recovery for 2 nights).</p>
              <p id="Par41">Our goodness of fit analyses found that the models were only weakly correlated with the actual data. The poor correlations that we observed are likely the result of individual differences in response to chronic sleep restriction. As a result, it would be advisable to use models such as those that we evaluated for general scheduling purposes (i.e., to determine if one schedule is superior to another) and not for making decisions about individual fitness for duty. In the spaceflight environment it could be risky for a vulnerable individual to be provided with average-level performance predictions, which might lead to that crewmember engaging in a dangerous task while unknowingly in a compromised state. There are models other than those that we evaluated that have been designed to determine individual changes in performance in response to sleep loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Such individualized models have the potential to allow for a personalized medicine approach to determining an individual’s fitness for duty and should be evaluated to determine their feasibility for operational implementation.</p>
              <p id="Par42">Although we were able to collect systematic information from carefully selected, astronaut-like individuals, our study is not without limitation. Our assessment was conducted in an Earth-based habitat that simulated the conditions of spaceflight; however, microgravity itself may influence cognition and the amount of sleep a crewmember requires in space. Despite this, our findings support the notion that individuals who possess the ‘right stuff’ are not immune to the effects of sleep loss on Earth. In addition, we used the PVT as our primary measure of cognitive impairment. The PVT is highly sensitive to sleep loss, but poor performance on the PVT may not reflect how crewmembers would perform on the more complex tasks required during a space mission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Finally, while crewmembers were restricted to 5 h of sleep during the week and 8 h of sleep on the weekends, we did not have objective sleep data. Although it is unlikely that the crewmembers achieved more sleep than scheduled, because they were prohibited from napping and were continuously monitored by mission control personnel. It is possible that the crew obtained less sleep than their time in bed, but we expect that the difference between time in bed and sleep duration would be modest given the sleep restriction protocol.</p>
              <p id="Par43">In this study we found that rigorously selected, astronaut-like individuals are susceptible to the effects of chronic sleep restriction. On average, crewmembers in this simulated spaceflight mission experienced a progressive decline in performance over 45 days of sleep restriction and they performed worse at the end of the day relative to the beginning of the day, although some individuals appeared able to sustain performance over the course of the mission, while others appeared more vulnerable. We found that bio-mathematical models designed to predict changes in performance following sleep loss may be useful tools for designing schedules for future space missions, but individualized models should be evaluated for potential fitness for duty application. Our findings support the concern that chronic sleep loss is associated with performance impairment during spaceflight and suggest that measures should be taken to ensure that crewmembers are provided with the schedules and environment necessary for optimal duration and quality of sleep.</p>
