                <p id="Par1">The International Space Station (ISS) is a unique habitat for humans and microorganisms. Here, we report the results of the ISS experiment EXTREMOPHILES, including the analysis of microbial communities from several areas aboard at three time points. We assess microbial diversity, distribution, functional capacity and resistance profile using a combination of cultivation-independent analyses (amplicon and shot-gun sequencing) and cultivation-dependent analyses (physiological and genetic characterization of microbial isolates, antibiotic resistance tests, co-incubation experiments). We show that the ISS microbial communities are highly similar to those present in ground-based confined indoor environments and are subject to fluctuations, although a core microbiome persists over time and locations. The genomic and physiological features selected by ISS conditions do not appear to be directly relevant to human health, although adaptations towards biofilm formation and surface interactions were observed. Our results do not raise direct reason for concern with respect to crew health, but indicate a potential threat towards material integrity in moist areas.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Human space exploration beyond boundaries of Earth and Moon is a declared goal of NASA, ESA, Roscosmos and other space-faring agencies, envisaging a potential human Mars mission in the next 20–30 years. Maintenance of crew’s health during a several hundred days journey in a confined artificial environment in space is one of the key aspects, which has to be addressed.</p>
              <p id="Par4">The human immune system was shown to be compromised under space flight conditions, as a significant decrease of lymphocytes and also of the activity of innate and adaptive immune response was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Adding an order of complexity, human health is intertwined with its microbiome, billions of microorganisms thriving on external and internal surfaces of the human body. Our body’s microbiome is prone to external factors, including the environmental microbiome, as they are in constant exchange and interaction.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Several risks with respect to microorganisms and human spaceflight have been identified. These include a potentially increased infection risk, as it has been shown that microgravity affects the virulence of certain microorganisms, such as <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Another stressor for the indigenous microorganisms is the strict maintenance regime, which could result in an increase of antimicrobial resistances, as recently shown for highly-maintained, confined built environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Some microorganisms might even pose a risk to the material integrity of a spacecraft: So-called technophilic microorganisms, in particular fungi, are able to corrode alloys and polymers used in spacecraft assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Technophilic microorganisms caused major problems on the former Russian space station MIR, partaking in damage to structural materials as well as malfunctioning of various space systems and equipment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Specifically, <italic>Bacillus, Penicillium</italic>, and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species were associated with the progressive destruction of a window in MIRs descent module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and mold on wiring connectors was associated with electrical outages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The majority of information with respect to environmental microbiome composition and dynamics aboard manned spacecraft is retrieved from ground-based simulation studies, such as the Mars500<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and the HI-SEAS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hi-seas.org/">http://hi-seas.org/</ext-link>) experiments. However, the International Space Station (ISS) has, like no other currently available testbed for long-term manned space missions, the scientific benefit of providing real spaceflight conditions, including microgravity and an elevated background radiation. The ISS orbits Earth ∼400 km above ground and is meanwhile constantly inhabited for more than 18 years.

Singh et al. assessed the succession and persistence of microbial communities and the associated antimicrobial resistance and virulence properties based on metagenomic reads obtained from samples of three flights.

                <p id="Par22">As metagenomics could only be performed on pooled subset of samples (due to low biomass restrictions and sampling set-up, see below), Tax4fun analysis was initially used to predict potential microbial metabolic capabilities, their location specificity, and potential shifts over time. The LEfSe analysis result is provided in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, and revealed a location specific predicted capacity of the microbial community, with e.g., increased predicted functions in KEGG pathway “Base_excision_repair” in samples from the cupola module.</p>
                <p id="Par23">On gene level, different functions were predicted, indicative of a respective module. Node 3 (ARED, treadmill, and WHC) revealed predicted signatures of cobalt/nickel and antibiotic transport system ATP binding proteins. Notably, a specific increase of a cobalt/zinc/cadmium resistance protein was predicted for Node 2 (sleeping area and panel samples), an iron complex transport system substrate binding protein for Node 1 (e.g., dining area), and an antibiotic transport system permease protein for the cupola area.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par49">In this study, we aimed to exploit the microbial information obtained from three sampling events aboard the International Space Station with respect to: (i) microbial sources, diversity and distribution within the ISS, (ii) functional capacity of microbiome and microbial isolates, (iii) extremotolerance and antibiotics resistance (compared with ground controls), and (iv) microbial behavior toward ISS-relevant materials (biofilm formation, potential degradation, or corrosion).</p>
              <p id="Par50">Based on our observations and previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we confirm a mostly human-associated microbiome aboard the ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Other proposed sources are cargo delivery, food (such as seasoning, dried fruits, nuts and herbs, or even probiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as indicated by the presence of e.g., <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus</italic> signatures), and potentially the personal belongings brought to the ISS. It shall be noted, that cargo deliveries are cleaned or even disinfected before upload<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, but an international standard for these procedures does not exist and thus the cleanliness of the cargo delivery might vary.</p>
              <p id="Par51">As a consequence, the ISS microbiome was characterized by a predominance of human (skin)- associated <italic>Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In general, these microorganisms are typical indicators for confined indoor environments (clean rooms, space stations, hospital areas such as intensive care unit, operating rooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; see also<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>).</p>
              <p id="Par52">Accordingly, all top 20 genera described in the hospital study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> were also detected in the entire ISS microbiome (mostly also under top 20). <italic>Enhydrobacter</italic> (Pseudomonadales, a typical environmental species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>) was the only hospital top 20 genus which was not detected by the molecular approach in this study, but an <italic>Enhydrobacter aerosaccus</italic> isolate was obtained from the Columbus RGSH. Within the top 20 list of the ISS microbial signatures, <italic>Haemophilus, Aerococcus, Stenotrophomonas, Gemella, Bacteroides, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Granulicatella, Blautia, Propionibacterium,</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> could not be found in the top 20 hospital list, indicating that those were more abundant in the ISS or even specific for this location.</p>
              <p id="Par53">All of these genera are typical human-associated microorganisms and thrive in the oral/respiratory tract (e.g., <italic>Haemophilus</italic>), on human skin (e.g., <italic>Propionibacterium</italic>) or the human gut (e.g., <italic>Blautia</italic>). Some of these microorganisms have opportunistic pathogenic potential, as also pointed out for <italic>Enterobacter</italic> species isolated from the ISS WHC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. We obtained in total eleven ISS isolates belonging to biosafety risk group S2 during this study, including <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> isolated from the RGSH in Node2 and isolates of the <italic>Bacillus cereus/anthracis/thuringensis</italic> clade retrieved from the RGSHs in Node2 and Columbus, from the hand grips in Columbus, and from the sleeping unit in Node2. However, most of these are typical human-associated bacteria which have only opportunistic pathogenic potential. Especially in the light of a weakened human immune system in space conditions, the presence and abundance of such opportunistic pathogens has of course to be carefully monitored, but as these do thrive in and on the human body and are shed into the environment by the crew itself, such opportunistic pathogens will always exist in built environments and their presence <italic>per se</italic> is not alarming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par54">The ISS microbiome was not found to be stable in composition and diversity, although a vast core microbiome existed over time and independent from location. All of the core microbiome genera have also been found in ISS dust samples from 2004 and 2008, as well as other ISS microbiome studies, indicating that this core microbiome is indeed established onboard the ISS, independent of the individual crew microbiome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, specific microbial patterns could be identified for various functional areas within the station, as e.g., the WHC and RGSH showed the highest number of unique RSVs. This is in agreement with the observations of Ruiz-Calderon et al. that, increasing with the level of human interaction, indoor surfaces reflect space use and, besides, show increased content of human-associated microbial signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par55">Differences in diversity and composition were detectable when two different time points (session A and B) were compared. It shall be mentioned, that no crew exchange took place during this period, but two cargo deliveries docked within this time frame, which could have influenced the microbiome composition. However, we detected an increase in specifically human (gut)-associated microorganisms (<italic>Escherichia/Shigella</italic>, <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic> etc.) over the sampling period, of which the reason is unknown. In this context, future research is needed covering multiple time points over a larger time series (monitoring) to better understand the microbiome dynamics and adaptation, but also possible transmission from and to humans.</p>
              <p id="Par56">A different picture was obtained from the cultivable diversity of the ISS microbial community, with <italic>Micrococcus yunnanensis</italic>, <italic>Bacillus hunanensis, B. megaterium</italic> and <italic>B. safensis,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> being cultivable from both sampling sessions, representing hardy (spore-forming) and human skin- associated microorganisms, whereas typical gut-associated microorganisms could not be retrieved by our enrichments, as our cultivation approaches were designed to target rather environmental, extremotolerant microbes. Thus, the cultivation- and molecular-based microbial community analysis is not fully comparable due to biases introduced by both methods. These include limitations in cultivation efforts, problems with DNA extraction and sequencing, and the detection of DNA also from nonviable organisms.</p>
              <p id="Par57">Archaeal signatures were detected in 14 of the 24 ISS samples (universal and specific approach). Most earlier studies on the ISS microbiome ignored the possible presence of Archaea, but some of the more recent studies also reported the detection of Archaea aboard the ISS but did not further discuss their existence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. We found, that archaeal signatures were nicely reflecting the frequency of human contact and the type of surface (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The detected sequences of Thaumarchaeota, Woesearchaeota, and <italic>Methanobrevibacter</italic> (Euryarchaeota) have all been attributed to the human microbiome before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par58">Our results support the pangenome-based observation of Blaustein et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, on genomic, but also on isolate and resistance-pattern level that ISS microorganisms are not necessarily more extremophilic or antibiotic resistant than their ground relatives. We propose that the ISS environment supports selection of the best-adapted microorganisms (e.g., spore-formers) toward the partially extreme physical and chemical environmental conditions (e.g., radiation, alkaline cleaning agents), but does not induce permanent changes in the physiological nor genomic capacities of microbes. Thus, we were not able to confirm the null hypothesis that strains obtained from the ISS are more extremotolereant/extremophilic than closely related strains from Earth regarding the upper and lower boundaries of their temperature and pH growth ranges. With the exception of <italic>Bradyrhizobium viridifuturi</italic> pH5_R2_1_I_B, all tested ISS isolates were able to grow at pH 9 or higher, which might be due to a selection pressure caused by alkaline cleaning reagents used onboard the ISS.</p>
              <p id="Par59">Moreover, the data presented here show that the molecular detection of antibiotic resistance genes, while being a good approximation of the resistance potential of an organism or microbial community, does on the one hand overestimate the antibiotic-resistance potential (as some resistance genes might not be expressed at all). On the other hand it does not necessarily cover all antibiotic resistances which a microorganism actually has. Thus we advise coupling traditional cultivation approaches with molecular investigations to retrieve a full picture of the situation.</p>
              <p id="Par60">Although we could not confirm an increased threat of ISS microbiome toward crew’s health, we observed that surface interaction is critical for the microbial community aboard. A variety of ISS surface materials are composed of metals, including alloy EN AW 2219 (aluminum copper magnesium), which might cause stress in microorganisms during interaction with metal ions and settlement. In our co-incubation experiments, we could confirm that ISS microbial isolates can adhere and grow on metal and in particular textile surfaces (NOMEX<sup>®</sup> fabric), where local moisture (e.g., condensate) could support biofouling, biofilm formation, and material damage through acid production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Surfaces onboard the ISS should of course not be exposed to nutrient rich liquid over such a long timeframe as it was done in this experiment, but our findings emphasize that local moisture has to be kept down to a minimum to prevent potentially harmful biofilm formation. This is additionally important with respect to fungal growth, as these might affect human health indirectly by causing allergic reactions and asthmatic responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par61">Although we cannot fully exclude a threat of the ISS microbiome toward crew health (in particular in interaction with the weakened human immune system) our data do not indicate direct reason for concern. However, we raise special attention to the microbial-surface interaction problem in order to avoid biofouling and biofilm formation, which could directly impact material integrity and indirectly human health and therefore pose a potential risk to mission success.</p>

                <p id="Par82">Cultivation, extraction, PCR, and sequencing controls were processed and analyzed in parallel to biological samples. An unused wipe not taken out of its bag on the ISS was extracted for every sampling session, cut into pieces, placed on the different media and DNA was also extracted from the solutions obtained with the negative controls. All cultivation controls were negative (no growth of colonies). Wipe solutions of the negative controls used for DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing revealed a low number of ribosomal sequence variants. These RSVs were removed from all other datasets, if present in the samples. In parallel, we used decontam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup> to purify the RSV table from possible “kitome” signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Information on the decontam analysis and according results is provided in Supplementary Note <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>, and Supplementary Data <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>.</p>

                <title>Study limitations</title>
                <p id="Par83">Spaceflight experiments especially suffer from limitations given by circumstances that cannot be influenced by the scientists. This affected e.g., the number of samples and replicates to be taken (limited mass of payload), the sampling procedure (compatible to microgravity conditions and safety requirements), selection of sampling time points (according to assigned crew time and the overall mission planning), and the delivery duration of the samples to the laboratory. Being aware of these circumstances, experiments were planned accordingly (&gt;5 years implementation phase), and numerous controls were run to ensure the integrity of the information retrieved.</p>
