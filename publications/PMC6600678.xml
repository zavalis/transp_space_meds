                <p>Spaceflight alters many processes of the human body including cardiac function and cardiac progenitor cell behavior. The mechanism behind these changes remains largely unknown; however, simulated microgravity devices are making it easier for researchers to study the effects of microgravity. To study the changes that take place in cardiac progenitor cells in microgravity environments, adult cardiac progenitor cells were cultured aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as well as on a clinostat and examined for changes in Hippo signaling, a pathway known to regulate cardiac development. Cells cultured under microgravity conditions, spaceflight-induced or simulated, displayed upregulation of downstream genes involved in the Hippo pathway such as YAP1 and SOD2. YAP1 is known to play a role in cardiac regeneration which led us to investigate YAP1 expression in a sheep model of cardiovascular repair. Additionally, to mimic the effects of microgravity, drug treatment was used to induce Hippo related genes as well as a regulator of the Hippo pathway, miRNA-302a. These studies provide insight into the changes that occur in space and how the effects of these changes relate to cardiac regeneration studies.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Space exploration is expanding rapidly and broadening our understanding of the world around us, as well as the cells within us. Technological advancements now allow us to perform cell culture studies aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to identify the molecular changes that take place in an environment of microgravity [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Several cell types have been cultured in space such as bone marrow progenitor cells [<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], mouse embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and human cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Microgravity has been shown to have both beneficial and detrimental effects on various cell types. For example, culture in microgravity conditions has been shown to cause hypertrophy in osteoblast cells [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and inhibits differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but beneficial effects include an increase in the expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair genes in human fibroblasts [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and an increase in migratory capacity in CPCs [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Upon reloading in normal gravity conditions, microgravity exposure during spaceflight can be beneficial. For example, Blaber et al. provided evidence that bone marrow derived mesenchymal progenitor cells harvested from mice flown in space exhibit greater osteogenesis potential in vitro under normal gravitational force [<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This study emphasizes the finding that transcriptional alterations in space can influence cell responses upon return to normal gravity and that the duration of exposure plays a significant role in the biological impact of microgravity. Studies performed on the ISS have begun to provide insight into these processes but opportunities for spaceflight culture are limited and take years to plan and complete. Alternative methods of studying microgravity play an important role in understanding the impact of microgravity on cell biology and how this information may be applied on Earth as well as in space.</p>
              <p>Simulated microgravity studies are currently being performed by several laboratories, and in some cases, the opportunity to directly compare simulated microgravity findings with similar studies performed on the ISS has provided insight regarding where similarities and differences may be expected [<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Simulated microgravity is achieved through the use of clinostats, which are devices that rotate cells continuously around one axis, 2D, perpendicular to the force of gravity, or two axes, 3D, to achieve weightlessness similar to the weightlessness experienced in space [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Samples being studied in clinostats are easily accessible and can be maintained on a regular schedule. The use of such devices has shown that simulated microgravity as a model can achieve transcriptional changes and/or functional effects in cells that are similar to those reported after culture on the ISS [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Yuge et al. has demonstrated the benefits of simulated microgravity specifically in terms of proliferation and survival [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additionally, this group has shown that mouse bone marrow stromal cells used for transplant following simulated microgravity exposure showed higher proliferation, survival, and regenerative capacity for spinal cord injury [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These findings further emphasize the possibility that microgravity, whether simulated or spaceflight-induced, may prove to be beneficial for other regenerative and transplant studies; however, the mechanism is not well understood. Further comparative studies are needed to validate simulated microgravity as an appropriate model of spaceflight.</p>
              <p>Research in our own lab has shown that CPCs cultured on the ISS or on a clinostat are more proliferative and demonstrate elevated levels of transcripts encoding growth factors and DNA repair genes [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One of the most significant transcripts impacted by microgravity exposure of adult CPCs cultured on the ISS was yes-associated protein (YAP1), a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and is responsible for controlling organ growth [<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. YAP1 expression is well-documented as relevant for promoting cell survival and inhibiting apoptosis as well as promoting repair in regenerative studies [<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The influence of simulated microgravity on YAP1 expression in adult CPCs, if determined, may therefore provide information relevant for cell therapy on Earth. The application of this information to stem cell-based treatment for heart disease has the potential to significantly improve the limited efficacy of current stem cell-based therapies. Adults, unlike neonates, are unable to functionally restore lost tissue following injury [<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus, the possibility of conditioning adult CPCs with short term exposure to microgravity to overexpress transcripts, including YAP1, which promote the survival of cardiac stem cells capable of repair could unexpectedly be beneficial. This novel path may be worth pursuing as a potential pretreatment and therapy for myocardial infarction patients on Earth, as high levels of YAP1 protect cells during differentiation and aid in improving cardiac function [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The following study is focused on the impact of microgravity experienced in spaceflight and simulated microgravity on the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in cardiovascular progenitor cells. Additionally, we present potential applications to cardiovascular stem cell transplantation in a clinically relevant model of cardiovascular repair.</p>

                <p>The early cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) cultured on the ISS and on the clinostat in our laboratory were derived from discarded cardiovascular tissue from human patients who have undergone clinically necessary procedures. Cell clones were isolated by single cell expansion and screened for the expression of markers specific to early cardiac progenitor cells as previously reported by our laboratory [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, they are mesoderm-committed and express markers indicative of early stage progenitors, including SSEA1, Mesp1, and PDGFRα. These patient-derived CPCs are unique based on their early stage marker profile at isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), clonal derivation and selection by co-expression of high levels of islet-1 and low levels of c-Kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f001">Figure 1</xref>B).

These cells also express CD56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f001">Figure 1</xref>C), which has been recently identified on the earliest stage of mesoderm-committed progenitor cells [<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and are capable of differentiating into the three lineages of the heart [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

                <title>2.2. Hippo Signaling Pathway Activity Differs in Adult and Neonatal Cardiac Progenitor Cells</title>
                <p>The Hippo signaling pathway was first discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and later identified in mammals [<xref rid="B36-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. When active, this pathway consists of a kinase cascade in which YAP1 is directly phosphorylated, and inactivated, by large tumor suppressor kinase 1 and 2 (LATS1&amp;2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). A key characteristic of phosphorylated/inactive YAP1 is cytosolic retention and apoptosis which prevents the expression of downstream targets involved in cell survival and proliferation [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. When the Hippo pathway is inhibited, active YAP1 is free to translocate into the nucleus and downstream targets such as SOD2, a marker of cell survival, are expressed. SOD2 alleviates the negative effects of reactive oxygen species released by cell stress or apoptosis [<xref rid="B38-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>
                <p>Using RT-PCR, we measured baseline expression levels of YAP1 in neonatal (8d–1-month-old) and adult (57–72-year-old) human CPCs isolated in our laboratory. Consistent with results published by Gise et al. which showed that YAP1 transcripts are abundant in the neonatal mouse heart but decline with age [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we show that YAP1 transcript levels in neonatal human CPCs are significantly higher than YAP1 levels in adult CPC clones isolated on the basis of comparable markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) (2.214 ± 0.171-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Additionally, neonatal CPCs have been shown to be more proliferative than mature adult CPCs [<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>

After 12 days aboard the ISS, adult CPCs expressed higher YAP1 levels by nearly threefold compared to ground controls before regressing back to normal expression by day 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f003">Figure 3</xref>B): 12 day (2.629 ± 0.186-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), 30 day compared to 12 day (−1.512 ± 0.014-fold difference, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Next, adult CPCs were observed under simulated microgravity conditions via 2D clinorotation. After 72 h, cell number increased by 1.7-fold and both YAP1 as well as its downstream target SOD2, were significantly upregulated compared to cells cultured in comparable hardware under normal gravity conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f003">Figure 3</xref>C): YAP1 after 72-h of simulated microgravity (11.76 ± 0.114-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), SOD2 after 72-h of simulated microgravity (83.05 ± 3.34-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). After 7 days of clinorotation, cell number increased 3.8-fold; however, YAP1 and SOD2 transcripts were lower compared to the 72h group: YAP1 after 7 days of simulated microgravity (2.364 ± 0.334-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), SOD2 after 7 days of simulated microgravity (19.28 ± 2.17-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The upregulation of YAP1 in simulated microgravity follows the same trend as microgravity experienced in spaceflight in that there is an initial increase of expression followed by a decline. SOD2 expression mimics the trend of YAP1 with more dramatic fold changes.</p>

                <p>The increasing evidence for a role of the Hippo pathway in cardiac regeneration in small animal models led us to investigate YAP1 in a sheep model of myocardial infarction and repair [<xref rid="B40-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

These cardiovascular progenitor cells isolated from sheep were previously reported by our group to be comparable to the islet-1+ human CPCs studied routinely in our laboratory [<xref rid="B43-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Control infarcted sheep hearts that were not injected with CPCs showed no change in YAP1 expression when comparing the infarcted region and the non-infarcted region of the heart. The infarcted zones of the cell-injected sheep hearts, however, had significantly higher YAP1 expression levels compared to their respective non-infarcted regions as observed by RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f005">Figure 5</xref>A): YAP1 PCR infarct without cell treatment (0.993 ± 0.047-fold change), YAP1 PCR infarct with cell treatment (2.554 ± 0.049-fold change, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001).

Damaged cardiac tissue had lower concentrations of P-YAP1, as well as higher levels of free, non-phosphorylated YAP1. In addition, transcripts encoding SOD2, a downstream target of YAP1, were significantly elevated in the infarcted regions of cell-injected sheep hearts relative to the non-infarcted regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f006">Figure 6</xref>): SOD2 expression in infarct zone of cell treated sheep (295.4 ± 14.14-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).

The results demonstrate that YAP1 expression levels, which are known to be protective, are further elevated in the zone of repair when neonatal YAP1-expressing CPCs are initially introduced post-infarction in large animals. In a parallel model, transgenic YAP1 overexpressing adult mice have significantly improved cardiac repair to an extent comparable to that of neonates [<xref rid="B46-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In sheep, pretreatment of adult CPCs with microgravity may therefore improve the outcome of cardiac repair.</p>

                <title>2.5. Adult CPCs Treated with 1uM of 17-AAG Demonstrated Increased Levels of YAP1 and SOD2</title>
                <p>In order to achieve regenerative capacity comparable to that of neonatal CPCs in adults, the adult CPC transcriptome would need to be modified to induce expression of genes such as YAP1 that promote repair. We have shown that spaceflight is capable of elevating YAP1 in adult CPCs and that these effects can be simulated on earth by the use of a clinostat; however, the availability of such a device is very limited. Alternative methods of conditioning adult CPCs to express higher levels of YAP1 would be beneficial. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a known regulator of the Hippo pathway that acts via the functional induction of LATS1 and LATS2 activity, the immediate upstream phosphorylators of YAP1. Using an Hsp90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), we were able to induce adult CPCs to express higher levels of active, non-phosphorylated YAP1. At a concentration of 1uM of 17-AAG, YAP1 expression was elevated starting at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-02742-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B): 48 h 1uM 17-AAG YAP1 (2.19 ± 0.073-fold change, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), 72 h 1uM 17-AAG YAP1 (3.24 ± 0.157-fold change <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>The response of adult CPCs to reduced gravitational force has been studied under both real and simulated microgravity conditions in a series of experiments that were previously performed by our laboratory [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; however, Hippo/YAP signaling was not extensively addressed. In the present study, we focused on the effect of real and simulated microgravity on the Hippo signaling pathway in adult CPCs, as well as the potential implications of these findings in cell-based repair. Under normal conditions, the Hippo signaling pathway is active in adults, and consequently, YAP1 expression is minimal. Here, we provide evidence that microgravity inhibits the Hippo pathway, driving adult cardiac cells to express higher levels of active YAP1.</p>
              <p>We have reported that adult CPCs have elevated YAP1 transcript levels after 12 days of culture aboard the ISS and upon returning to normal gravity, are viable and proliferate actively after microgravity exposure [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Upon further investigation, we find that after 30 days of culture aboard the ISS, YAP1 induction is reduced compared to the 12-day flight sample. These findings demonstrate that microgravity has short term effects on YAP1 induction in adult CPCs. Temporary YAP1 activation dedifferentiates mature hepatocytes into progenitor cells that are more proliferative and capable of regeneration [<xref rid="B48-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Transient induction of YAP1 transcripts in adult cardiac cells could prove to be beneficial based on the role of YAP1 in organ growth and proliferation, whereas permanent over-expression of YAP1 may result in oncogenic behavior [<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It is important to note that the effects of microgravity following spaceflight are temporary in our cells, as well as in the hearts of astronauts. Interestingly, upon returning from space expeditions, astronauts temporarily present with enlarged or abnormally shaped hearts [<xref rid="B52-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Considering the Hippo pathway’s role in regulating organ size, it is plausible to suggest that this signaling pathway may be inhibited not only in cardiovascular stem cells but in the heart itself as a consequence of spaceflight.</p>
              <p>Simulated microgravity experiments performed in our lab demonstrate similar changes in YAP1 transcripts compared to cells flown in space. The application of these findings in a simulated microgravity setting are significant because the results are achievable in the absence of space radiation which has been shown to cause DNA damage and has negative effects on the cardiovascular system, such as fibrosis and increased atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B53-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="B55-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The use of simulated microgravity provides the beneficial effects of spaceflight without the increase in radiation exposure, making it a potentially valuable tool for microgravity-related applications on Earth. Activation of YAP1 induces expression of SOD2, a marker of cell survival that functions in the mitochondria to clear toxic reactive oxygen species, preventing apoptosis [<xref rid="B56-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The dual upregulation of both YAP1 and SOD2 in adult CPCs is indicative of beneficial cellular modifications that lead to a more proliferative cell which migrates more efficiently and is more inclined to survive. We have previously shown that microgravity activation does not impair differentiation in adult CPCs [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>miRNA-302a, which activates the miRNA cluster 302/367 consisting of miR-302a-d, miR-367 and a number of other miRNAs, is a significant regulator of Hippo pathway activity [<xref rid="B57-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In mice, it has been shown that miRNA-302a is directly responsible for inhibiting the activity of LATS2, making it a key target for inducing YAP1 expression [<xref rid="B58-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Similarly, repression of LATS2 activity via 17-AAG treatment elevated YAP1 transcript levels. We have demonstrated that this effect was mediated in part by an induction of miRNA-302a which has been shown to promote a more proliferative cell state [<xref rid="B59-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] with the ability to reintroduce the regenerative effects commonly found in neonates [<xref rid="B60-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
              <p>The age-dependent response to cardiac injury that distinguishes adults and neonates is due, in part, to differing gene expression profiles. Neonatal CPCs are prime candidates for cardiovascular transplant studies due to their enhanced regenerative abilities and proliferative nature [<xref rid="B60-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. YAP1 is a gene that is highly expressed in neonates due to its role in cardiac development; however, in adults, YAP1 expression is limited [<xref rid="B62-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In the context of cardiac repair, YAP1 plays a large role in cell survival and proliferation [<xref rid="B46-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B63-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B64-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. YAP1 overexpression in adult mice is sufficient to reintroduce regenerative potential normally found in neonates [<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The ability to reintroduce YAP1 expression in adult CPCs may therefore increase the efficacy of regeneration in these cells. Verification of these findings in large animal models, which have not yet been investigated, would provide support for this concept in a model that is more clinically relevant for humans [<xref rid="B37-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B65-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Sheep have a similar heart shape, resting heart rate, and blood pressure as humans and can provide valuable information regarding safety for cell-based repair [<xref rid="B67-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. We show that neonatal CPCs expressing high levels of YAP1 are retained for prolonged periods in our sheep model. Whether or not YAP1-induced adult CPCs will have comparable regenerative abilities remains to be determined. Future studies are needed to investigate how YAP1 overexpressing adult cells will behave following transplantation.</p>
              <p>Our demonstration that 17-AAG mediates YAP1 induction in adult cells, accompanied by elevated SOD2 expression and miRNA-302a transcript levels, may therefore prove to be a valuable alternative preconditioning treatment. 17-AAG is a derivative of geldanamycin, a toxic Hsp90 inhibitor, and has been a focus in cancer research due to its availability and reduced toxicity [<xref rid="B68-ijms-20-02742" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The FDA has previously approved 17-AAG for clinical use and has placed it on a list of approved small molecule inhibitors, making it a safe alternative to induce YAP1 in humans.</p>
              <p>We conclude from this study that microgravity activates YAP1 expression in adult cardiovascular progenitor cells. These findings have potential benefit for cardiovascular repair. Our data suggests that further studies defining the functional and safety implications of microgravity-activated cells in a sheep model of cardiovascular repair would provide valuable insight regarding microgravity-mediated conditioning in vivo. Inducing adult CPCs to over-express YAP1 is a first step towards conditioning these progenitors to have reparative potential closer to that of neonatal cells. Additional effects on the transcriptome still need to be defined, but as we continue to explore the outskirts of space, understanding the biological effects of microgravity on human cells and organs will allow us to adapt the human body to these effects in space and/or potentially apply this information in a beneficial way on Earth.</p>

In short, 50 mg of sample was homogenized in Qiazol (Qiagen) before being centrifuged through the provided RNeasy Mini spin column followed by a series of washes with provided buffers. RNA was eluted with 40 µL RNase-free water. cDNA was synthesized with Superscript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). PCR plates were run under the following conditions: 94 °C for 10 min, 94 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s, repeated for 45 cycles. Primers for our genes of interest were created using NCBI Primer-BLAST and are displayed in <xref rid="ijms-20-02742-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. RT-PCR was performed with a Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
