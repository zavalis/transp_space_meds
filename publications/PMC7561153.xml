              <abstract>
                <p>The effectiveness of a simulated microgravity environment as a novel method for preserving the freshness of vegetables was investigated. Three types of vegetables were selected: vegetable soybean, mung bean sprouts, and white radish sprouts. These selected vegetables were fixed on a three-dimensional rotary gravity controller, rotated slowly. The selected vegetables were stored at 25°C and 66% of relative humidity for 9, 6, or 5 d while undergoing this process. The simulated microgravity was controlled utilizing a gravity controller around 0 m s<sup>−2</sup>. The mung bean sprouts stored for 6 d under simulated microgravity conditions maintained higher thickness levels than the vegetable samples stored under normal gravity conditions (9.8 m s<sup>−2</sup>) for the same duration. The mass of all three items decreased with time without regard to the gravity environment, though the samples stored within the simulated microgravity environment displayed significant mass retention on and after 3 d for mung bean sprout samples and 1 d for white radish sprout samples. In contrast, the mass retention effect was not observed in the vegetable soybean samples. Hence, it was confirmed that the mass retention effect of microgravity was limited to sprout vegetables. As a result of analysis harnessing a mathematical model, assuming that the majority of the mass loss is due to moisture loss, a significant difference in mass reduction coefficient occurs among mung bean sprouts and white radish sprouts due to the microgravity environment, and the mass retention effect of simulated microgravity is quantitatively evaluated utilizing mathematical models. Simulated microgravity, which varies significantly from conventional refrigeration, ethylene control, and modified atmosphere, was demonstrated effective as a novel method for preserving and maintaining the freshness of sprout vegetables. This founding will support long-term space flight missions by prolonging shelf life of sprout vegetables.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Vegetables constitute an important food staple, forming a source of micronutrients containing vitamins and minerals [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, it is quite difficult to store fresh vegetables and maintain their freshness after they have been harvested, and the loss/waste rate of vegetables during the distribution process is 18% in developed countries and 46% in developing nations [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The causes of vegetable loss are due to wilting, loss of L-ascorbic acid [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], discoloration [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and spoilage [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several methods for preserving vegetable freshness have been studied and analyzed.</p>
              <p>Among these methods investigated, refrigeration is the most versatile and prevalent freshness preservation method for vegetables. Li et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported the effect of retaining visual acceptability among refrigerated produce, and suppressing mass loss and decay for eight types of items stored at 6°C. Controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, which suppresses respiration under low O<sub>2</sub> and high CO<sub>2</sub> environments, demonstrates a significant freshness-keeping effect when used in combination with refrigeration, and is employed for the long-term storage of apples [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A storage unit is harnessed for CA storage. In contrast, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), which is obtained by achieving the same effect using a plastic pouch, stops the spoilage of tomatoes [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the softening of persimmons [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and suppresses the yellowing of soft kale [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and vegetable soybeans [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The inactivation of ethylene gas as an aging hormone is an effective freshness-keeping method, and a high number of freshness- effects derived from the ethylene-inactivating regent “1-methylcyclopropene” were reported as introduced in a review by Watkins [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Heat treatment has been identified as possessing the effect of sterilizing microorganisms, deactivating enzymes, and inducing heat shock protein to maintain freshness in vegetables [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Akbudak et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that heating vegetables at 54°C for 5 min was effective for preserving the freshness of tomatoes. However, currently, an impactful freshness preservation method has not been employed practically other than the aforementioned freshness maintenance technologies. Therefore, a novel method of maintaining freshness in vegetables is highly desirable to improve the produce marketplace and industry’s storage abilities.</p>
              <p>The wilting of vegetables due to mass loss is an important cause of degradation in vegetables after the harvest period. The majority of the mass loss in vegetables after harvest is due to moisture loss, which is mainly associated with transpiration [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hirano and Kitaya [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported that transpiration increases with higher levels of gravity over the course of a parabolic airplane flight experiment utilizing grown strawberries as a plant sample. This phenomenon of increased transpiration may also be observed within postharvest vegetables. Thus, it is hypothesized that the transpiration rates and mass loss of vegetables postharvest can be reduced by placing the vegetables under a controlled microgravity environment.</p>
              <p>In recent years, a device capable for creating and maintaining a microgravity environment on Earth has been developed and harnessed to investigate biological reactions in outer space. The principle of operation of the microgravity device is to rotate the object 360° slowly in order to bring the mean value of gravity close to 0 m s<sup>−2</sup>. To be precise, the created conditions are different from the microgravity conditions found in outer space, so the machine is suitably referred to as a simulated microgravity device. Several studies published investigating the applications of this device include the homogenization of crystals [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the attenuation of rat myogenic differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the effects of microgravity on epidermal stem cell metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Experiments utilizing plants have reported microRNAs in tomato that respond to gravity [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the delay of rice flowering in a simulated microgravity environment [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, no report has been found concerning changes in the quality of horticultural products after harvest in relation to an experimental microgravity environment.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of vegetable storage and freshness preservation facilitated by a simulated microgravity environment as a new method for produce quality protection postharvest. Since a stable supply of food is important for long-term stays in space, research on food production in space environment has been conducted in recent years [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The results of this study will support long-term stay missions by extending the shelf life of the crop.</p>

The gravitational acceleration under the experimental environment where the vegetable sample prepared as the control was placed measured 9.8 m s<sup>−2</sup>, and the sample attached to the gravity controller was stored in an environment where the gravitational acceleration measured ca. 0 m s<sup>−2</sup>. The principle of operation of the microgravity device is to rotate the object 360° slowly in order to bring the mean value of gravity close to 0 m s<sup>−2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Within this study, it was considered possible to conduct an experiment to adequately investigate the effect of gravity on the mass loss of postharvest vegetables.</p>

Nagano and Shimaji [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that the higher the levels of the moisture content in vegetables, the wider the plant width, and Bovi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that the mass loss of vegetables postharvest was mainly attributed to moisture loss. According to the aforementioned findings, it was thought that the thickness of mung bean sprouts was retained under the simulated microgravity environment because moisture levels were retained in the experimental conditions.</p>

The principle of operation of the microgravity device is to rotate the object 360° slowly in order to bring the mean value of gravity close to 0 m s<sup>−2</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Normal gravity was 9.8 m s<sup>−2</sup> (gravitational acceleration on earth). In the case of vegetable soybean, the difference in gravity levels did not affect the mass retention rate during the storage period for 9 d. In contrast, in the case of mung bean sprouts, the mass retention rate was significantly higher in the simulated microgravity environment, on and after 3 d following the initiation of storage, and in the case of white radish sprouts, on and after 1 d following the beginning of storage. This suggests that the simulated microgravity environment possesses a mass retention effect, and that the effect varies depending on the type of vegetable present under these conditions.</p>

              <p>According to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240809.g004">Fig 4</xref>, mass loss of vegetables cannot be suppressed even under the microgravity condition. However, in the present study, simulated microgravity exhibited the effect of preserving the mass retention rate of sprout vegetables such as mung bean sprouts and white radish sprouts. Because vegetable soybean is a product obtained by harvesting a portion of the grain, it is thought that the moisture lost from the surface of the sheath led to subsequent mass loss. This mechanism of mass loss may not be affected dependent of gravity levels. In contrast, the two types of sprout vegetables possess roots, stems and leaves, and it is possible that, in addition to the dissipation of moisture from the plant surface, moisture also moved from the roots through the plant canal, leading to transpiration from the leaves. The <italic>k</italic> value in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0240809.g005">Fig 5(B)</xref> is considered to be the value corresponding to the combined moisture loss by transpiration and moisture loss from the plant surface. Regarding the effect of microgravity on plant tissue, there are several studies utilizing <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (L.) Heynh as a sample. Leitz et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported that gravitational sensing sites such as endothelial cells and columella cells were deformed and activated when the kinetic energy of statolith sedimentation was converted into biochemical signals. Toyota et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that sedimentation leads to the activation of mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, resulting in elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in plants. Under the simulated microgravity environment, the direction of gravity is not able to be sensed, the moisture loss due to transpiration is suppressed, and the <italic>k</italic> value decreases, so it is possible that the mass was retained.</p>
              <p>The decline in mass (i.e., mostly moisture) of vegetables lowers nutritional quality, salability (due to wilting, shriveling, softening, increased flaccidity, limpness, loss of crispness, and juiciness), and economic income, due to the loss of salable mass [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, mass retention is important in maintaining freshness, and the mass retention of vegetables by refrigeration [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], CA storage [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], MAP [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], though there are no reports regarding mass retention of vegetables stored in microgravity environments. Although the range of the data in the present study is limited to sprout vegetables, it was suggested by the results that a simulated microgravity environment is effective as a novel freshness preservation technique for postharvest vegetables. When simulated microgravity is employed in combination with conventional storage technologies such as low temperature and modified atmosphere (low O<sub>2</sub>, high CO<sub>2</sub>), it is possible that a synergy mass retention effect may be observed.</p>
              <p>In addition, data on vegetable freshness in a simulated microgravity environment may be useful for space development research. Several studies on plant cultivation in space exist in current literature. Kitaya et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] cultivated tomato seedlings in a Controlled Ecological Life Support System and promoted growth by supplying CO<sub>2</sub>. Takahashi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] investigated the effect of auxin on tropism by performing a cucumber germination experiment aboard a space shuttle. Paul et al. [<xref rid="pone.0240809.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] introduced many reports on plant biology enabled by the space shuttle, e.g. Brassica plants on STS-87 had altered chloroplast morphology and altered chlorophyll <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> ratios. Since no data have been found concerning changes in the freshness of postharvest vegetables in outer space, it is hoped that the results of this study will be confirmed in outer space in the future.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The overall effect of preserving the freshness of postharvest vegetables under a simulated microgravity environment produced by slowly rotating an object by 360° was investigated in this study. The mass loss of two types of vegetables, mung bean sprouts and white radish sprouts, was suppressed by placing them under a simulated microgravity environment. Since mass loss is a serious phenomenon of freshness degradation among harvested vegetables, the effect of preserving the freshness of vegetables was recognized in the simulated microgravity environment. In contrast, in the case of vegetable soybeans, the suppression of mass loss in the samples was not observed under the pseudo-microgravity environment. According to the aforementioned results, it was confirmed that the simulated microgravity environment possesses the effect of preserving the freshness of the studied sprout vegetables. Since the mass reduction coefficient of the mathematical model for calculating the mass reduction velocity was minimized to be smaller under the simulated microgravity environment than under the normal gravity environment, the freshness preservation effect under the simulated microgravity environment was quantitatively proved. This founding will support long-term space flight missions by prolonging shelf life of sprout vegetables.</p>

              <p>Additional Editor Comments (if provided):</p>
              <p>The authors demonstrate that simulated microgravity is effective over conventional methods such as refrigeration to preserve the nutritional value of sprout vegetables. They should consider rephrasing the title, ex., “Efficient preservation of sprouting vegetables under simulated microgravity conditions”. They have observed that vegetable sprouts placed in a simulated microgravity environment preserve the mass maintaining freshness over time. However, they should clarify the implications of the study with respect to space environment or during long-term space flight missions in conclusions of Abstract, Introduction and Conclusions noted (p.11; line 262). Methods-(p.6; line 136) they should clarify the section for statistical significance considered. Also, they should provide microgravity simulation method with citation. Provide a rationale for Fig.2 and Fig.4 under Results and Discussion (p.6; line 142 &amp; p.7; line 171). Fig.3 provided appears to be an illustration. They should show real picture or image of mung bean sprouts under experimental conditions. They should explain the Fig.5B results clearly. The figure shows closed bars and open bars representing normal and microgravity conditions, however no significant change in Soybean. They should explain the results and Figure.5 clearly for the decrease in mass loss under microgravity conditions. I suggest the authors to proofread and take language assistance in preparing the manuscript.</p>

              </p>
              <p>1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p>
              <p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? </p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?</p>
              <p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#sharing">PLOS Data policy</ext-link> requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?</p>
              <p>PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: Yes</p>

              <p>5. Review Comments to the Author</p>
              <p>Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions above. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)</p>
              <p>Reviewer #1: This is a clearly written, easy to read research article. It approaches the concept of using a clinostat from a completely new angle - to increase shelf life and improve food preservation of sprouts. While not necessary to add to this current work, I noted the mention of ethylene scrubbing as a means of food preservation, and I am curious if the author has considered the problems that plants often encounter with ethylene in an enclosed environment, specifically on clinostats and in the true microgravity of spaceflight. Ray Wheeler has several publications on this topic, and it seems odd that they were not addressed nor mentioned. I encourage them to look into the topic.</p>
              <p>**********</p>
              <p>6.
