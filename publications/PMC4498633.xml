              <abstract>
                <p>Microgravity has a profound effect on cardiovascular function, however, little is known about the impact of microgravity on progenitors that reside within the heart. We investigated the effect of simulated microgravity exposure on progenitors isolated from the neonatal and adult human heart by quantifying changes in functional parameters, gene expression and protein levels after 6-7 days of 2D clinorotation. Utilization of neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors in ground-based studies has provided novel insight into how microgravity may affect cells differently depending on age.</p>
                <p>Simulated microgravity exposure did not impact AKT or ERK phosphorylation levels and did not influence cell migration, but elevated transcripts for paracrine factors were identified in neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors. Age-dependent responses surfaced when comparing the impact of microgravity on differentiation. Endothelial cell tube formation was unchanged or increased in progenitors from adults whereas neonatal cardiovascular progenitors showed a decline in tube formation (p&lt;0.05). Von Willebrand Factor, an endothelial differentiation marker, and MLC2v and Troponin T, markers for cardiomyogenic differentiation, were elevated in expression in adult progenitors after simulated microgravity. DNA repair genes and telomerase reverse transcriptase which are highly expressed in early stem cells were increased in expression in neonatal but not adult cardiac progenitors after growth under simulated microgravity conditions. Neonatal cardiac progenitors demonstrated higher levels of MESP1, OCT4, and brachyury, markers for early stem cells. MicroRNA profiling was used to further investigate the impact of simulated microgravity on cardiovascular progenitors. Fifteen microRNAs were significantly altered in expression, including microRNAs-99a and 100 (which play a critical role in cell dedifferentiation). These microRNAs were unchanged in adult cardiac progenitors.</p>
                <p>The effect of exposure to simulated microgravity in cardiovascular progenitors is age-dependent. Adult cardiac progenitors showed elevated expression of markers for endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation whereas neonatal progenitors acquired characteristics of dedifferentiating cells.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Microgravity, as experienced by humans when in space, affects cardiovascular function resulting in post-flight orthostatic intolerance, cardiac atrophy, and heart rhythm disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, little is known about the impact of altered gravitational force on cardiac progenitors that normally reside within the heart. Simulations of gravitational changes while here on earth have demonstrated that cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, are force-sensitive. This may be due to mechanosensors which operate within mechanotransduction pathways that alter cell function upon exposure to changes in the force of gravity [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In mesenchymal stem cells, hypergravity increased differentiation into cardiomyocytes and osteoblasts [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] whereas simulated low-gravity inhibited osteogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and resulted in higher levels of adipogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Exposure of other stem cell types to simulated microgravity such as embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], umbilical cord blood stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], adipose-derived stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], liver stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and cancer stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have established a link between gravitational force and changes in cell identity, either towards stemness or differentiation.</p>
              <p>Stem cell responses to simulated microgravity may be influenced by age. With age, the regenerative capacity of cardiovascular progenitors found within the heart decreases [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have previously reported that Isl-1 positive cardiovascular progenitors isolated from the neonatal and adult heart exhibit ageâdependent disparities in functional parameters such as cell cycle progression and invasion which may stem from underlying differences in gene and microRNA expression [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Determining the effect of simulated microgravity on resident cardiac progenitor cell function <italic>in vitro</italic>, and whether this effect is dependent on age would have implications not only for space flight, but would also provide evidence as to whether alterations in gravitational force could be utilized as a therapeutic for improved cardiovascular stem cell function.</p>
              <p>In this report, we characterized the effect of simulated microgravity on both neonatal and adult cardiovascular Isl-1+ progenitor cell clones by culturing them in a 2D clinostat which minimizes the gravitational force by rotating cells perpendicular to the pull of gravity. Functional parameters including cell cycle progression, migration, cell differentiation into endothelial and cardiomyogenic lineages, as well as gene and protein expression changes after 6â7 days in simulated microgravity were assessed. Our approach allowed us to define both age-related and overall responses of endogenous cardiovascular progenitors to simulated microgravity conditions.</p>

                <p>The Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University approved the protocol for use of tissue that was discarded during cardiovascular surgery, without identifiable private information, for this study with a waiver of informed consent. In brief, right atrial cardiac tissue from human neonates (&lt;1 month old) and adults (57â75 years old), was cut into small clumps (approximately 1 mm<sup>3</sup>) and collagenase digested (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) for approximately 2 hours at 37 degrees at a proportion of 1:2.5 tissue volume vs. collagenase. This solution was then passed through a 40 Î¼m cell strainer to isolate cardiac progenitors [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Resulting cells were cloned by limiting dilution at a concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create clonal populations which were expanded for further study.</p>

                <title>Simulated Microgravity</title>
                <p>Isl-1+ cardiac stem cell clones from both the neonatal and adult heart were cultured for 6â7 days in a 2D clinostat (Bioserve, Boulder, Colorado). A 2D clinostat simulates the absence of gravity by maintaining cells in constant rotation perpendicular to the force of gravity. Cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cells per Opticell using both inner surfaces for cell growth or 100,000 cells per Biocell with one surface for cell growth, gassed with a mixture of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 95% air, then subjected to clinorotation. The Biocell is centered within the rotating chamber. The width provides a cell growth area of 5.5cm. The rotation rate is 3.94+/-0.01 rotations per minute. The cells farthest from the center will experience the greatest centrifugal forces as a consequence of the rotation. The relative centrifugal force on these cells is &lt;0.5mG.</p>
                <p>Once CPCs reached confluency within the Opticell or Biocell (6 or 7 days), they were trypsinized, counted, and used for subsequent experiments. Controls were similarly seeded and grown under static conditions within a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator for a matched period of time.</p>

                <p>A unique feature of early stem cells is the high expression level of proteins that protect their DNA from damage. This allows the cells to divide and maintain genomic integrity. As stem cells age or differentiate, they lose this ability to effectively protect their DNA which can, over time, lead to cell senescence or death. After exposure to simulated microgravity, elevated expression of DNA repair transcripts including RAD50 (10.4 fold) and RAD23 (1.8 fold) was noted in neonatal CPCs (<xref rid="pone.0132378.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, n = 4, p&lt;0.05). E2F1 and ATM were also elevated in neonatal CPCs, but not significantly (4.8 fold, p = 0.12 and 6.5 fold, p = 0.085 respectively). These changes in gene transcription were not present in adult CPCs (<xref rid="pone.0132378.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Elevated transcription of DNA repair genes in neonatal CPCs after simulated microgravity was associated with an increased percentage of cells within the S phase of the cell cycle (12.4% vs 4.9%, p = 0.03, <xref rid="pone.0132378.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) and an increase in cell proliferation when compared with adult CPCs exposed to simulated microgravity. After 6â7 days in simulated microgravity, neonatal CPCs approximately tripled the number of cells seeded (58.9 x 10<sup>4</sup> vs 20 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells seeded) whereas adult CPCs did not increase in cell number (19.5 x 10<sup>4</sup> vs 20 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells seeded, <xref rid="pone.0132378.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>).

There was a small non-significant increase in the percentage of Troponin T positive cells (6.9%) in adult CPCs.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>In this study, we assessed functional parameters, gene expression, and protein levels in stem cells that normally reside within heart after 6â7 days of 2D clinorotation. By using progenitors from both the neonatal and adult heart, we determined that age governs the functional outcome of cardiovascular stem cells exposed to simulated microgravity. Isl-1+ neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors exhibited similar responses to simulated microgravity in terms of cell migration and ERK/AKT activation, but opposing responses when comparing the effect of simulated microgravity on cell differentiation.</p>
              <p>Studies performed in other laboratories using various cell types have reported that migration is one of the parameters that can be altered by exposure to 2D [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and 3D clinorotation [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study, despite elevated levels of growth factor transcripts induced by simulated microgravity, cardiovascular progenitor cell migration was not altered. This is consistent with data reported by Versari et al (2007), who demonstrated that endothelial cell migration was not increased by exposure to simulated microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, there was no evidence for activation of the ERK or AKT pathways in Isl-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells, although mesenchymal stem cells have been reported to have reduced ERK [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or AKT [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] phosphorylation levels as a consequence of simulated microgravity exposure. Simulated microgravity appears to have a cell-type dependent impact on activation and migration of stem cells.</p>
              <p>Age-related differences significantly influenced differentiation under simulated microgravity in our study. Adult CPCs showed enhanced endothelial cell differentiation and elevated levels of von Willebrand factor after clinorotation. This is consistent with other studies in which mesenchymal stem cells demonstrated an increase in endothelial cell differentiation after simulated microgravity exposure [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Transcripts for MLC2v and Troponin T were elevated in adult Isl-1+ CPC, indicating that differentiation along the cardiomyocyte lineage and endothelial cell lineage is a functional outcome following culture of adult early cardiovascular progenitor cells under reduced gravity conditions.</p>
              <p>Neonatal CPCs, on the other hand, did not form tubes effectively after clinorotation. This is consistent with other cell types, including osteoblasts and adipose-derived stem cells which show dedifferentiation and increased stemness with simulated microgravity exposure [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In bone marrow stromal cells, dedifferentiation after simulated microgravity is a response that favors cell survival and improves regenerative capacity [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
              <p>In an effort to gain further understanding regarding the mechanistic basis behind the differential impact of simulated microgravity on differentiation, we used microRNA profiling to study the epigenetic effects that simulated microgravity has on Isl-1+ neonatal cardiovascular progenitors. MicroRNAs are potent regulators of gene expression; one microRNA has the ability to target multiple genes in a given pathway. In other cell types, microRNA expression is significantly altered with exposure to simulated microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] or real microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Girardi et al found that after 24 hours in simulated microgravity, the expression levels of 42 microRNAs were significantly changed in peripheral blood lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In our study, the expression of 15 microRNAs was significantly altered in neonatal CPCs after seven days of simulated microgravity. Interestingly, microRNAs-99a and miR-100 were among those which were significantly downregulated in neonatal, but not adult CPCs. MicroRNA-99a and miR-100 transcripts are undetectable in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells, but the level of expression increases with cell differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In animals with superior regenerative ability, such as zebrafish, microRNA-99a and miR-100 are strongly downregulated at the initiation of regeneration and result in dedifferentiation of existing cardiomyocytes [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
              <p>Both of these microRNAs as well as microRNA-125a-5p (which was also significantly decreased with simulated microgravity) are downregulated during skin wound-healing [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. MicroRNA-125a-5p represses the expression of pro-regenerative proteins such as Lin28[<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Lin28 overexpression is associated with improved repair of tissues such as cartilage, bone, and mesenchyme [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Decreased expression of microRNA-125a-5p is associated with cell dedifferentiation [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and in human embryonic stem cells antagonizing microRNA-125a-5p inhibits cell differentiation and upregulates pluripotency markers [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Several other microRNAs that were significantly downregulated in neonatal CPCs also positively correlate with cell differentiation including microRNA-424[<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and microRNA-137[<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, microRNAs that promote <italic>in vitro</italic> endothelial differentiation including microRNA-424[<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], let-7f [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and miR-155[<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] were downregulated with simulated microgravity in neonatal CPCs.</p>
              <p>The reduction in the expression of microRNAs that positively correlate with cell differentiation after simulated microgravity, although significant, are not of a magnitude to recapitulate embryonic stem cell phenotype. Many of these microRNAs are elevated anywhere from 40 to 1400 fold in neonatal CPCs when compared with human embryonic stem cells (<xref rid="pone.0132378.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) whereas, with simulated microgravity, microRNAs are decreased approximately 2 to 3 fold. Therefore, neonatal CPCs, when exposed to microgravity, have characteristics of dedifferentiated cells, but the microRNA expression profile is not equivalent to that of embryonic stem cells.</p>
              <p>A unique characteristic of early stem cell populations is their high levels of DNA repair proteins and telomerase reverse transcriptase that play a role in maintaining DNA integrity over a large number of population doublings [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In our study, we found high levels of telomerase reverse transcriptase and DNA repair proteins in neonatal CPCs after simulated microgravity. In contrast to this, Kumari et al reported that, in human lymphocytes, exposure to clinorotation for 7 days reduced the expression of DNA repair proteins [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and similarly, Sun et al reported reduced telomerase activity in MSCs cultured in a rotary cell culture system [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Our data demonstrates that elevated expression of DNA repair proteins in neonatal Isl-1+ CPCs with simulated microgravity is supported by microRNA expression differences. MicroRNA-195 which was significantly decreased with simulated microgravity (p = 0.0083) is predicted to inhibit RAD50 expression (using miRanda, miRDB, miRWalk, and Targetscan databases), and microRNA-185 which was also decreased with simulated microgravity (p = 0.028) is predicted to inhibit RAD23A expression (using miRanda, miRWalk, TargetScan databases).</p>
              <p>Further evidence of neonatal CPC dedifferentiation, as a consequence of exposure to simulated microgravity, is the upregulation of stemness-associated genes MESP1, brachyury and Oct4. All three of these genes are characteristic of an early stem cell population and are expressed early in the process of cell commitment to cardiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study there was a 4-fold increase in the expression of Oct-4. In neural stem cells, retroviral vector-induced expression of Oct-4 alone was enough to reprogram cells to a pluripotent state functionally similar to embryonic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Oct4 is known to bind at the promoter of miR-137[<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], a microRNA which inhibits cell stemness [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], this microRNA was also significantly decreased with simulated microgravity in neonatal CPCs.</p>
              <p>When compared with the adult heart, the neonatal heart contains progenitors that have superior regenerative capacity [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. During the neonatal window, the heart is a rich source of early cardiovascular progenitors and as an infant matures, the heart increases in size while the proportion of early stem cells decreases [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0132378.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In this study, we were able to manipulate the process whereby neonatal cardiovascular progenitor cells activate a conserved regenerative microRNA program. In other cell types, a simulated microgravity-induced shift towards an undifferentiated state enhanced the repair potential of cells [<xref rid="pone.0132378.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Whether, in our study, this change in cell phenotype displayed by neonatal cardiovascular progenitors is advantageous, long-lasting, and provides a cell type with greater regenerative capacity has yet to be determined. Future studies planned on the International Space Station will determine whether a similar effect occurs in the space environment or if this phenomenon is induced by shear stress forces that may influence gene expression under simulated microgravity conditions.</p>
