                <title>SUMMARY</title>
                <p id="P3">Understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low-earth orbit, the moon, and beyond. <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on a second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ deposits. Remarkably, in long-QT causing <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1<italic>g</italic>, although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be a fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P6">Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go “where no man has gone before,” coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1<italic>g</italic>, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels.</p>
              <p id="P7">Cardiac health has been a major concern of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for many years, but the clinical evidence for decreased function and unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease is limited. Early studies performed on astronauts who had been in microgravity for only a few weeks to a few months failed to uncover any cardiac effects (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2011</xref>), and some studies suggested that changes in function could be explained by dehydration (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Summers et al., 2005</xref>). However, the number of subjects examined in those studies was low, with sometimes conflicting results, and they were without discernable (cardiac) health risks, so it is difficult to draw conclusions. Experiments designed to mimic longer-term exposure to microgravity (bed rest in humans and hind limb unloading in mice) showed reductions in cardiac contractility (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Platts et al., 2009</xref>) and increases in arrhythmia (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Respress et al., 2014</xref>). Increases in ventricular contraction (QT) intervals have also been reported in astronauts after longer-duration flights (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">D’Aunno et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting reductions in the cardiac repolarization reserve (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Akoum et al., 2011</xref>), but those conclusions are again based on few subjects with differing genetic backgrounds.</p>
              <p id="P8">Dysfunction in several cardiac ion channels are known to cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene, also known to code for the hERG channel, is one of the ion channels that contribute to LQTS. hERG channel dysfunction can be caused by alterations in the genes encoding this channel as well as by some commonly used medications (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P9">To systematically explore the effects of spaceflight on the heart, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiac model to examine how prolonged exposure to microgravity affects cardiac health. We report the effects of microgravity on heart function in wild-type (WT) fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Canton-S [CS]) that were born, developed, and spent 1–3 weeks as adults aboard the International Space Station (ISS) compared with their ground-based controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We also examined the effects of microgravity on flies with mutations in <italic>seizure</italic> (<italic>sei</italic>), the fly homolog of the human hERG gene. Our results show that structural and functional cardiac remodeling occurs in response to microgravity and that remodeling is more severe in the channel mutants. Cardiac RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of WT and <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant flies and follow-up immunohistochemistry studies suggest that alterations in proteostasis likely contribute to the observed changes in cardiac function in microgravity.</p>

                <title>Lifelong Microgravity Exposure Caused Cardiac Dysfunction and Remodeling</title>
                <p id="P10">We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, each with 10 females and 5 males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10–12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1<italic>g</italic> (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1<italic>g</italic> (days 3–5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1<italic>g</italic> before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]).</p>
                <p id="P11">For cardiac function assays, flies were dissected under artificial hemolymph and allowed to equilibrate for 15–30 min in fresh, aerated, artificial hemolymph. The contracting hearts were filmed with high-speed digital cameras (140–160 frames/s [fps]) for subsequent heart-function analysis (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Fink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>). Measurements of heart diameters were made at the widest portion of the second abdominal chamber during systole and diastole. Exposure to microgravity resulted in significant reductions in end-diastolic diameters (EDDs) of SF CS female fly hearts compared with hearts from ground controls (GCs) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, top left). This reduction was not the result of changes in the overall size of female flies because there was no significant difference in body length in response to microgravity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>). There was a trend toward reduced diastolic diameters in male flies, which did not reach statistical significance, as well as a small reduction in the overall body length of SF CS males (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, bottom left, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref>). No significant effects of microgravity were observed on end-systolic diameters (ESDs) under microgravity in either sex (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, both sexes showed significant decreases in fractional shortening ([EDD – ESD]/[EDD]), which is an indirect measure of cardiac contractility (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The functional consequence of reduced diameters in females was a highly significant reduction in cardiac output (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P12">As previously observed (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Ocorr et al., 2017</xref>), cardiac size and output in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant hearts were already significantly reduced at 1<italic>g</italic> compared with CS hearts (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Interestingly, there was a small but significant increase in diastolic diameters in response to microgravity in hearts from female <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants, which translated into a modest increase in the cardiac output (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, top).</p>
                <p id="P13">The length of time the heart spent in diastole and systole was also quantified from high-speed movies. There were no significant differences between 1<italic>g</italic>- and microgravity-exposed flies (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>). However, hearts from female SFR flies did show a significant increase in the systolic intervals, perhaps a response to increased load when returned to 1<italic>g</italic>. Male CS hearts showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>, bottom; arrhythmia index [AI], a measure of beat-to-beat variability) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Ocorr et al., 2007</xref>), which was not seen in SFR flies. The AI trended higher in females but did not reach the level of significance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>, top). We observed the expected bradycardia and increased arrhythmia in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant flies compared with CS controls at 1<italic>g</italic>, but it was not significantly worsened in microgravity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1B</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D</xref>).

                <p id="P15">Hearts from WT CS flies reared in microgravity compared with 1<italic>g</italic> GCs showed upregulation of 250 genes (1.25-fold; adjusted [adj.] p value ≤ 0.05); of which, 86 genes were increased ≥2.0-fold (adj. p value ≤ 0.01) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Ontological analysis of the 250 upregulated genes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation bioinformatics microarray analysis showed an ~20-fold enrichment in proteasome-mediated ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent protein catabolism genes, a 23-fold enrichment in chromatin assembly and disassembly genes, and a 12-fold enrichment in genes with endopeptidase activity, among other ontologies (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

                <p id="P18">We identified 38 genes that were commonly upregulated and 189 genes that were commonly downregulated in both WT and mutant hearts under microgravity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Within the 38 commonly upregulated genes, we identified multiple proteasomal/Ub-dependent protein catabolic genes, including ProsAlpha6, Rpn13, Npl4, and CG2046 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Within the 189 downregulated genes, there was a 7.9-fold enrichment in carbohydrate metabolic process genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2</xref>).

Among downregulated genes, there was also a 3.2-fold enrichment in genes encoding proteins found in the ECM.

Adjusted read-count data for all samples have been provided (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>).

                <title>Microgravity Exposure Caused Myofibrillar and ECM Remodeling of the Heart</title>
                <p id="P19">We examined the cardiac morphology of GC and microgravity-reared flies in a subset of hearts used for the functional assays. Phalloidin staining of filamentous actin (F-actin) revealed the myofibrillar structure within the myocardial cells that make up the heart tube (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). In CS GC hearts, the myofibrils are typically tightly packed and circumferentially arranged within those cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), such that shortening of the sarcomeres results in a squeezing of the heart tube and ejection of the hemolymph present within the heart lumen (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Video S1</xref>). Hearts from flies exposed to microgravity have myofibrils that are much more loosely arranged, with gaps, and were organized in a more-longitudinal orientation compared with 1<italic>g</italic> controls (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Myofibrillar reorganization or remodeling has previously been documented in hearts from <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Ocorr et al., 2017</xref>) and was again observed in hearts from 1<italic>g</italic>
<italic>sei/hERG</italic> GCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, hearts from <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants reared in microgravity showed even-more-extensive myofibrillar reorganization and disarray than GCs, and F-actin staining was diminished compared with GCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P20">To further quantify myofibrillar structure, we calculated relative sarcomere lengths from our F-actin-stained z stack images (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>) by quantifying the number of sarcomeres per 30-μm myofilament length. Sarcomere number was significantly reduced under microgravity for both female and male Canton-S flies (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that hearts from SF flies were capable of generating less force than their GC siblings. Sarcomere counts in Canton-S SFR hearts were not different from GC hearts and, for heart diameters, there were no significant differences among any of the hearts from sei/hERG mutants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P21">In conjunction with the myofibrillar remodeling, we also observed a significant reorganization of the ECM surrounding the heart. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart, this extracellular network consists primarily of the collagen IV homolog pericardin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that network of collagen IV fibers surrounding the heart (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), and we show that it partially co-localizes with the z-band protein α-actinin (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S4A</xref>-<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4H</xref>). In GC CS flies, those collagen fibers run orthogonally over the myofibrils of myocardial cells (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>) to form what appears to be a stabilizing network. Hearts from female CS flies reared in microgravity showed noticeable reductions in that myofiber-associated network (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>), consistent with the myofibrillar remodeling. Quantification of the cardiac muscle associated networks showed that this reduction was significant in SF female hearts (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), although the decrease seen for CS male flies did not reach significance (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). This result was unexpected because cardiomyopathy from compromised heart function is usually accompanied by <italic>increased</italic> collagen deposition, i.e., fibrosis.</p>
                <p id="P22">This myofibril-associated collagen network in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant GCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>) was already significantly reduced compared with that of CS GCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>), also likely a reflection of the previously observed myofibrillar remodeling in these mutants at 1<italic>g</italic> (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Ocorr et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we did observe <italic>intra-chamber</italic> fibrosis in a large percentage of hearts analyzed from <italic>sei</italic> mutants on the ground (arrows in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C″</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3C′</xref>), something we rarely observed in CS flies at 1<italic>g</italic> or microgravity. At 1<italic>g</italic>, 60% of <italic>sei/hERG</italic> versus 1% of CS females and 65% of <italic>sei/hERG</italic> versus 16% CS males showed evidence of intra-chamber collagen IV localization (p &lt; 0.005, Mann Whitney unpaired t test for both males and females). Unexpectedly, most hearts from SF <italic>sei/hERG</italic> females exhibited only faint collagen fibers, and there were large globular aggregates of collagen in the cardiac lumen as well as deposits that appeared to fill-in gaps between myofibrils (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D′</xref>, and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D″</xref>). Hearts from SF <italic>sei/hERG</italic> males exhibited more-extensive pericardin networks compared with SF <italic>sei/hERG</italic> females, but those networks were also reduced in microgravity compared with <italic>sei/hERG</italic> male GCs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>
                <p id="P23">The observed structural and morphological changes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>) correlate with a complex misexpression of various cardiac sarcomeric genes, (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, top). Control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of human actin orthologs, including <italic>Actin88F</italic> (hACTB) and <italic>Actin79b</italic> (hACTA/B). However, unique to CS, expression of the sarcomeric organizational gene <italic>basigin</italic> (hBSG), z-band localized metabolic genes <italic>GAPDH1</italic> and <italic>GPDH</italic>, and unconventional myosin <italic>jaguar</italic> (<italic>jar</italic>) (hMYO6) were reduced, whereas the later three were upregulated in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> flies under 1<italic>g</italic>. Conversely, sarcomeric organizational gene <italic>rolling pebbles</italic> (<italic>rols</italic>) (hTANC2) was upregulated in CS in microgravity. Interestingly, reduced expression of a variety of myosin-related genes was observed exclusively in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants under microgravity, including <italic>myosin heavy chain</italic> (<italic>Mhc</italic>) (hMHC7), <italic>myosin light chain1</italic> (<italic>Mlh1</italic>) (hMYL1), <italic>Myo10A</italic> (hMYO15A), and <italic>Tropomyosin 1</italic> (Tm1) (hTPM1).</p>
                <p id="P24">Additionally, the observed changes in ECM content and morphology also correlated with misexpression of collagen/ECM regulatory genes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, bottom). Both control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of <italic>procollagen lysyl hydroxylase</italic> (<italic>plod</italic>) (hPLOD1-3) and <italic>lysyl oxidase-1</italic> (<italic>lox</italic>) (hLOXL2). These collagen maturation genes promote collagen cross-linking and ECM formation. However, in SF CS flies, the collagen network degradative gene, <italic>matrix metalloproteinase 1</italic> (<italic>MMP1</italic>) (hMMP14/24), was also downregulated. In <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants, cardiac <italic>MMP1</italic> expression was elevated under both gravity conditions, relative to CS. However, for CS, <italic>MMP2</italic> (hMMP15) expression was reduced in microgravity. CS flies exhibited a reduction in multiple collagen-type-IV-encoding genes, including <italic>Cg25C</italic> (hCOL4A1), <italic>viking</italic> (<italic>vkg</italic>) (hCOL4A1), <italic>Col4a1</italic>(hCOL4A1/2/6), and <italic>pericardin</italic> (<italic>prc</italic>), as well as collagen and fibrinogen domain containing CG30280 (hFIBCD1) and CG31832 (hFCN1). Interestingly, most of these genes are upregulated in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> at 1<italic>g</italic> compared with CS, as would be expected under pathological cardiac remodeling conditions. Nevertheless, their expression shows a similar reduction under microgravity. The notable exceptions are the elevated CG30282 (see <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>) expression in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants, which remains high in space. Importantly, this misexpression of cell adhesion genes may underlie the observed misregulation of the pericardin network under microgravity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

                <title>Proteasome Numbers Are Significantly Increased in Hearts from SF Flies</title>
                <p id="P25">Remarkably, nearly all the genes encoding proteasome subunits were significantly upregulated under microgravity in hearts from CS WT flies (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, at 1<italic>g</italic>, proteasome gene expression was already reduced in the hearts from <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants relative to CS. Nevertheless, microgravity exposure also resulted in upregulation of cardiac proteasome genes in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants relative to their <italic>sei/hERG</italic> GCs (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), albeit to levels that were still reduced relative to CS GCs. Our observation that cardiac proteasome gene expression was significantly upregulated in response to microgravity suggested that protein folding had been compromised and/or degradation was elevated. We had a fortunate and unique opportunity to test that hypothesis on a subsequent mission launched to the ISS aboard SpaceX commercial resupply service (CRS)-11 using the same protocol as for CRS-03. For this study, we generated flies that expressed UAS-polyQ46 GFP only in the myocardial cells using a tinCΔ4-Gal4 driver. This GFP-tagged 46-glutamine repeat polypeptide (PolyQ46) is an intermediate length between disease-causing polyQ repeat lengths and the WT polyQ containing proteins (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Melkani et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that treatment with agents that increase reactive oxygen species in the heart increase the number and size of GFP-positive plaques (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Melkani et al., 2013</xref>) in UAS-polyQ46 GFP-expressing hearts. In this respect, polyQ46 acts as a marker for protein misfolding and aggregation under cardiac proteostatic stress.</p>
                <p id="P26">Immunohistochemical analysis (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6F</xref>) of hearts from GC flies exhibited GFP-positive plaques and anti-proteasome puncta (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; GC), which were typically found near myocardial cell nuclei. Hearts from microgravity-reared flies had significantly more GFP-positive polyQ plaques (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) covering a larger area of the heart (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) compared with 1<italic>g</italic> controls. Proteasome puncta were also more abundant (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), covering a larger total area (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) of the heart. In addition, in myocardial cells, a significant amount of α-proteasome “haze” was observed, which could represent less-highly aggregated proteasomes (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; SF). Taken together, these data suggest that, in the heart in space, proteasomal gene and protein expression is dramatically upregulated, although proteosomes are likely dysfunctional, as manifest by co-localized proteasomal and polyQ aggregates.</p>

              <title>DISCUSSION</title>
              <p id="P27">As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered <italic>g</italic> forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1<italic>g</italic>. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the “bulk” properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of filaments is important because those filaments reveal how molecular properties scale up and how bulk properties of muscle fibers are dictated by nanoscale phenomena. The current work, using the genetically tractable <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level. Similar to humans, exposure to microgravity has profound effects on fly muscle function, as has been previously reported for flies exposed to microgravity for short durations (2 weeks) (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Miller and Keller, 1999</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P28">Heart function analysis in our denervated, semi-intact preparations confirmed a cardiac-specific effect of space flight, with heart chamber size and cardiac contractility and output being significantly reduced under microgravity (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). These findings were consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>), reduced sarcomere count (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>), and misregulation of sarcomeric genes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), including actins, myosins and tropomyosin, and sarcomere organizational genes. Troponin mutations that interfere with tropomyosin binding have already been documented in the fly heart to cause cardiac dysfunction, cardiac restriction, and myofibrillar disarray (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Madan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Viswanathan et al., 2014</xref>), similar to our observation in space flies. In addition, we previously observed that specific myosin-transducer mutations that affect rates of ATP hydrolysis have differential effects on myofibrillar structure, including restrictive (when rates are faster) and dilatory (when rates are slower) cardiomyopathies (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Cammarato et al., 2008</xref>). We have also shown that mutations in unc-45, a chaperone involved in myosin protein folding, significantly alter myofibrillar structure in the fly heart (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Melkani et al., 2011</xref>). Although a role for Myo10A (Sisyphus) has not yet been described in the heart, it has been shown to promote transport of cell-adhesion cargo and to bind integrins, which we have previously shown to be critical to cardiac structure and function (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Nishimura et al., 2014</xref>), thus suggesting a possible role for this unconventional myosin in the heart. Sarcomeric contractile and structural proteins provide the fundamental molecular basis for cardiac function and have well-established roles in the etiology of a variety of cardiac diseases (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Marston, 2018</xref>). Our studies show that prolonged exposure to microgravity is associated with transcriptional misexpression of sarcomeric genes, cardiomyocyte myofibrillar disorganization, and ultimately, cardiac contractile dysfunction. Lack of an effect on overall chronotropy, along with an increased incidence of arrhythmia in male flies is consistent with findings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Wnorowski et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P29">Under pathological cardiomyopathy conditions, collagen deposition is usually increased leading to fibrosis, which contributes to impaired contractility. Surprisingly, the collagen IV network that normally surrounds and attaches to the cardiomyocytes was decreased under microgravity. Remodeling occurred in both CS and, to a greater extent, in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant hearts, which also exhibited intra-lumen fibrosis and collagen aggregation. These observations were consistent with misexpression of collagen and ECM maturation and degradative genes, as well as collagen and cell-adhesion-encoding genes. Although fibrosis is generally associated with cardiac disease, ECM degradation is an observed feature in both the volume-overloaded heart and in end-stage diastolic remodeling from pressure overload (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Frangogiannis, 2019</xref>). ECM degradation is associated with features of contractile dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, potentially due in part to loss of matrix-dependent signals that are required for preservation of function. Additionally, misregulation of ECM composition has also been implicated in cardiac disease. Taken together, ECM remodeling is a potential maladaptive effect of prolonged exposure to microgravity in our model and may be a contributing factor to the observed cardiac dysfunction.</p>
              <p id="P30">Expression of basigin, a transmembrane protein (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>) involved in sarcomeric organization, was significantly downregulated in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant hearts relative to WT at 1<italic>g</italic>, but exposure to microgravity resulted in an increased expression in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants. Basigin has been shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in pressure overload models and to activate matrix metalloproteinases that degrade ECM components and thus promote ECM remodeling. This is consistent with the expression of MMP1 maintained in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants compared with CS and may have a role in the dramatic collagen IV remodeling in SF <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant hearts. This sarcomeric modification may serve to stiffen the heart wall, allowing cardiac output to be maintained in mutants at microgravity, despite the myofibrillar remodeling and overall reduced expression of muscle structural proteins. Interestingly, basigin (CD147) has recently emerged as a potential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
              <p id="P31">Gap junctions are important intercellular connections among cardiomyocytes, allowing the organ to work as a syncytium. They are composed of connexins in vertebrates and innexins in flies. Innexin 2 and 3 have both been shown to be present in the fly heart (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Cammarato et al., 2011</xref>). Under microgravity conditions innexin 2 is significantly downregulated in both CS (−1.76-fold; p = 0.002) and in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutant hearts (−1.59-fold; p = 0.045), whereas innexin 3 expression is altered only in <italic>sei/hERG</italic> mutants (−1.8-fold; p = 0.002). Together with the reduction in genes encoding cell-adhesion proteins, it is likely that electrotonic coupling of the myocardial cells was impaired.</p>
              <p id="P32">Another surprising finding was the significant upregulation of genes encoding nearly every subunit of the proteasome. We were able to confirm that microgravity exposure resulted in an increase in protein aggregates and associated proteasome particles on a subsequent flight. The increase in polyQ-GFP aggregates and proteasome puncta suggests that microgravity induces dramatic changes in protein turnover and/or protein misfolding. Recent evidence indicates that oligomers, such as huntingtin/PolyQ proteins, bind to and inhibit proteasomes by preventing injection of proteins into the degradation chamber (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Thibaudeau et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, proteasome dysfunction has been suggested as a causative factor and is observed in a variety of cardiomyopathies (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Gilda and Gomes, 2017</xref>), heart failure, and cardiac amyloidosis (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Pattison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Sanbe et al., 2005</xref>). We have also shown in flies that cardiac amyloidosis caused structural remodeling reminiscent of the remodeling observed in flies reared in microgravity (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Melkani et al., 2013</xref>). The increase in proteosome gene and protein expression in space may reflect increased turnover of sarcomeric proteins or may be a compensatory response to the likely muted proteosome function by misfolded and aggregated proteins. This interpretation is consistent with smaller hearts and less muscle mass, as in astronauts, and could be contributing to the observed cardiac remodeling and functional defects. Interestingly, in hearts from K<sup>+</sup> channel mutants, expression of nearly all proteasome genes was already downregulated at 1<italic>g</italic> compared with WT controls. Nevertheless, proteasome gene expression was modestly upregulated in hearts from space-reared mutants suggesting that this may be a fundamental response of cardiac muscle to lowered gravity. It is likely that this generalized increase in proteasome content underlies cardiac muscle atrophy.</p>
              <p id="P33">In contrast to the increase in proteasomes, expression of proteolytic genes was generally downregulated in microgravity. Recent quantitative analyses of human cardiac fuel usage showed that non-failing hearts undergo proteolysis and actively secrete amino acids. This process was nearly doubled in failing versus non-failing hearts (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Murashige et al., 2020</xref>). It was unclear whether upregulation of proteolysis was adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, it is interesting that SF fly hearts showed decreased expression, perhaps as a reflection of an overall reduction or shift in fuel usage by the heart under microgravity.</p>
              <p id="P34">The current studies examined the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, whereas the exposure of astronauts is more temporally limited. However, future space exploration efforts by government and commercial ventures are focused on missions to the moon, asteroids, and Mars, and those explorations will require astronauts to spend many months and perhaps years in altered gravity. Thus, information on how prolonged microgravity exposure affects different organ systems will be critical to the success of those efforts (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Criscuolo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Prasad et al., 2020</xref>). It is likely that, at the cellular level, there are underlying and conserved responses to altered gravity that are shared between organisms. Approximately 75% of disease-causing genes are conserved between flies and humans. Thus, the fly model can have a key role in elucidating the effects of microgravity during prolonged space flight, with significant advantages over other model systems because of its small size, its well defined and conserved genetics, and its relatively short lifespan.</p>

                  <p id="P38">Fly lines used in this study were <italic>Canton S</italic> laboratory WT lines (Bloomington Stock Center) and a K<sup>+</sup> channel mutant <italic>seizure</italic> (<italic>seizure<sup>ts1</sup></italic>, a gift from Dr. Barry Ganetsky). The <italic>sei/hERG mutants</italic> were previously isolated in a screen for ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS)-induced paralytic mutations on the second chromosome (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Titus et al., 1997</xref>). Flies launched to the International Space Station (space flown, SF) and the corresponding ground controls (GC) were housed in polystyrene vials (75 x24 mm) with 10 mL of standard cornmeal-based fly food containing double the usual amount of 10% Tegosept and cellulose acetate plugs. Approximately 24 hours prior to launch, 15 vials were each loaded with 10 virgin females and 5 male adult flies. Loaded vials were placed in a Plexiglas tray and inserted into a vented fly box (VFB; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), a modified version of a Nanoracks box. The VFB was placed into a canvas case for loading into the Dragon capsule. Launch of SpaceX CRS-3 occurred at 19:25 UTC on April 18, 2014. Flies were kept in the VFB throughout the 30-day mission and were stored aboard the docked Dragon capsule that shared atmosphere with the ISS. The Dragon capsule unberthed at 13:26 UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) on May 18, 2014 and re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere occurred the same day at 19:05 UTC. Following retrieval of the Dragon capsule off the coast of Mexico, the VFB was offloaded at Long Beach Port, California and transported by car to La Jolla, California in a climate-controlled vehicle. Surviving adult flies were collected from the vials at 23:30 UTC on May 20, 2014. Data collection, which included heart function studies, tissue collection for RNaseq, and tissue preservation for immunohistochemistry, was completed by 07:30 UTC on May 21, 2014 on all μg space flown and corresponding ground control flies (specific methods described below). The protocol and associated timeline are outlined schematically in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The VFB was oriented such that the g-load was directed down into the food supply located at the bottom of the vials. This orientation was maintained throughout the entirety of the mission, from point of transfer at the lab at NASA Kennedy Space Center through stowage on the Dragon capsule, and again from Dragon un-berthing to opening of the VFB in the lab at SBP Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. Ground control flies were prepared and reared under identical conditions in ground-based incubators with temperature and humidity controlled to levels recorded on the ISS.</p>
                  <p id="P39">Following initial adult fly collections, vials were maintained for three days at 25°C and adults that emerged were collected and aged as a mixed sex cohort for two weeks at 1g (Space Flight Recovery, SFR). These flies were then analyzed as for SF and GC flies.</p>
                  <p id="P40">Identical protocols were followed for the launch of the PolyQ46 flies aboard SpaceX CRS-11 on June 03, 2017 at 21:07 UTC until splashdown which occurred at 12:12 UTC on July 03, 2017. VFBs were again returned to Long Beach Port, California and transported via a climate-controlled vehicle to La Jolla, California on the same day, arriving at approximately 03:00 UTC on July 5, 2017. All dissections and fixation of heart tissue (described below) were performed within 48 hours of arrival in La Jolla.</p>

Contractility was estimated based on end diastolic (EDD) and end systolic (ESD) diameters, measured from moves using SOHA. (i.e., fractional shortening = (EDD-ESD)/EDD). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated assuming the heart is a cylindrical tube, where volume was estimated using V = π(r<sup>2</sup>)x h, for a 1 micron portion of the tube (h = 1). Thus, Stroke Volume (SV) = (π(1/2(EDD<sup>2</sup>)−(π(1/2(ESD<sup>2</sup>) and cardiac output ©) = mean heart rate x SV.</p>
