                <p>Microgravity-induced bone loss is a main obstacle for long term space missions as it is difficult to maintain bone mass when loading stimuli is reduced. With a typical bone mineral density loss of 1.5% per month of microgravity exposure, the chances for osteoporosis and fractures may endanger astronautsâ health. Parathyroid Hormone or PTH (1â34) is an FDA approved treatment for osteoporosis, and may reverse microgravity-induced bone loss. However, PTH proteins requires refrigeration, daily subcutaneous injection, and have a short shelf-life, limiting its use in a resource-limited environment, like space. In this study, PTH was produced in an Fc-fusion form via transient expression in plants, to improve the circulatory half-life which reduces dosing frequency and to simplify purification if needed. Plant-based expression is well-suited for space medicine application given its low resource consumption and short expression timeline. The PTH-Fc accumulation profile in plant was established with a peak expression on day 5 post infiltration of 373 Â± 59Â mg/kg leaf fresh weight. Once the PTH-Fc was purified, the amino acid sequence and the binding affinity to its target, PTH 1 receptor (PTH1R), was determined utilizing biolayer interferometry (BLI). The binding affinity between PTH-Fc and PTH1R was 2.30 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>Â M, similar to the affinity between PTH (1â34) and PTH1R (2.31 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>Â M). Its function was also confirmed in a cell-based receptor stimulation assay, where PTH-Fc was able to stimulate the PTH1R producing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with an EC<sub>50</sub> of (8.54 Â± 0.12) x 10<sup>â9</sup>Â M, comparable to the EC<sub>50</sub> from the PTH (1â34) of 1.49 Ã 10<sup>â8</sup>Â M. These results suggest that plant recombinant PTH-Fc exhibits a similar binding affinity and potency in a PTH1R activation assay compared to PTH. Furthermore, it can be produced rapidly at high levels with minimal resources and reagents, making it ideal for production in low resource environments such as space.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Microgravity-induced bone loss is a main obstacle for long term space missions. Bone is a dynamic organ that serves important mechanical and calcium homeostatic functions (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Demontiero et al., 2012</xref>). It constantly undergoes a self-regeneration process called bone remodeling, a process in which the old bone is resorbed by osteoclasts and new bone is regenerated by osteoblasts. Maintaining a balance between bone resorption and regeneration is critical for human health. For astronauts exposed to microgravity, it is very difficult to maintain such a balance; as the loading stimuli reduces, there is an increase in bone resorption with no change or even decreased bone formation, leading to bone density loss (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ohshima, 2012</xref>). Microgravity-induced bone loss became a concern since Gemini flights (1â14Â days durations, 1962â1966), where âsmall but significantâ bone loss was reported with less than 2Â weeks of microgravity exposure (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Mack et al., 1967</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">MACK and LaChance, 1967</xref>). Although the percentage of bone mineral density (BMD) loss was measured using densitometry of plain X-rays in these studies, which was not an accurate methodology, it raised the awareness of detrimental effects of microgravity on bone density. As technology advanced, the typically BMD loss was determined to be 1.5% per month of microgravity exposure (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ohshima, 2012</xref>), which endangers astronautsâ health with an increased chance for osteoporosis and fractures, especially during extravehicular activities. Physical exercise as a countermeasure for BMD loss is effective but cannot eliminate the problem completely (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Ohshima, 2012</xref>). Bone regenerative therapeutics such as PTH (1â34, Forteo<sup>Â®</sup>), are FDA approved treatments for osteoporosis, and have vast potential to reverse microgravity-induced bone loss. PTH stimulates bone regeneration by activating osteoblast cells through binding to the PTH1R on its cell surface, and promotes bone formation. However, PTH requires refrigeration, daily subcutaneous injection, and has a short shelf-life, limiting its use in a resource-limited environment, like space. To improve circulatory half-life of PTH and minimize resources utilized for protein production in space, PTH was expressed in a Fc-fusion form, namely PTH-Fc in plants transiently. The addition of the Fc component will likely allow for a longer circulatory half-life by interaction with the salvage neonatal Fc-receptor (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007</xref>) and avoids frequent redosing. Studies using a recombinant PTH-Fc fusion protein produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> showed a 33-fold increase in mean circulation residence time in rats as well as significant increases in bone volume, density and strength in osteopenic mice and rats (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Kostenuik et al., 2007</xref>). A single dose of a fusion between PTH (1â33) and the collagen binding domain (PTH-CBD), designed to increase circulatory half-life, sustained increases in BMD by &gt;10% in normal mice for up to a year (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ponnapakkam et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
              <p>Unlike most other biologic production platforms, producing biologics in plants transiently requires only growing plants and an expression vector to deliver the gene. In this study, <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> (<italic>Agrobacterium</italic>) was used to deliver a PTH-Fc expressing cassette into plant tissue by vacuum infiltration given its horizontal gene transfer capacity. Alternatively, a plant virus (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Kawakami et al., 2004</xref>) or particle bombardment (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kikkert et al., 2005</xref>) can be used for gene delivery to further reduce resource requirements. In addition to its low resource requirement, plants present no risk of mammalian pathogen infection and are capable of post-translational modifications, making it a well-suited platform for biologics production under resource constraints.</p>
              <p>PTH-Fc forms a homodimer under physiological conditions <italic>via</italic> disulfide bridges within the Fc hinge region. The Fc domain serves solely as a serum half-life enhancer in this fusion protein; thus, the Fc N-glycosylation site was removed to avoid potential Fc effector functions and associated inflammatory responses. In addition, a SEKDEL C-terminal motif was included to target PTH-Fc for ER retention, which often results in a higher protein yield than targeting proteins for secretion (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Sainsbury and Lomonossoff, 2008</xref>). In this study, the PTH-Fc expression, integrity, receptor binding affinity and receptor stimulation efficacy were evaluated, and the biological activity of PTH-Fc was compared to the PTH (1â34) peptide. To our knowledge, this is the first report of recombinant protein of PTH-Fc in plants.</p>

The PTH-Fc fusion protein sequence consists of PTH (amino acids 1â34, UniProtKB: P01270), a flexible linker (GGGGS), the Fc region of human IgG1 (amino acid 108â329, Genbank: AAC82527.1) with a point mutation (N111Q on PTH-Fc) making the protein aglycosylated, followed by a C-terminal ER retention motif of SEKDEL. The PTH-Fc coding sequence was cloned into the replicating vector with gemini viral components (LIR, SIR, C1, and C2) allowing for replication of the DNA fragment flanked by the LIR domains by rolling circle replication process upon agroinfiltration (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).

                <p>PTH-Fc was transiently expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> whole plants <italic>via</italic> agroinfiltration, and the expression level from 1â6Â days post infiltration (DPIs) was determined in crude plant extract with a direct ELISA detecting the Fc domain of PTH-Fc. Protein expression (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) was first detected on 2 DPI and continued to increase until 5 DPI, reaching a maximum expression level of 373 Â± 59Â mg/kg leaf fresh weight; after 5 DPI the protein level started to drop. This expression level is comparable to another Fc-fusion protein produced transiently in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest that 5 DPI is the optimal harvesting time for PTH-Fc, and protein degradation in the plant exceeds production with a longer incubation period. The Western blot analysis on crude extracts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) from 1 to 6 DPI confirmed the presence of the PTH domain, with a band height around the theoretical molecular weight of PTH-Fc monomer at 31.1Â kDa. The higher band between 50 and 75Â kDa in samples from 3, 4, and 5 DPIs represents the nonreduced PTH-Fc dimer.</p>

                <p>As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, PTH-Fc (PTH: 4.1 kDa; linker + Fc: 27Â kDa, PTH-Fc: 31.1Â kDa) and a positive control protein (47.2Â kDa) containing a C-terminal SEKDEL motif were probed by an anti-PTH antibody and an anti-SEKDEL antibody. On the anti-PTH Western blot (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), only the PTH-Fc sample shows a band between 25 and 37Â kDa. The faint band in the control lane was due to the PTH-Fc sample overflowed from the adjacent lane. On the anti-SEKDEL Western blot (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), intense bands in both lanes at their expected molecular weights are present, which confirms the presence of SEKDEL sequence in both samples. The missing coverage in MS analysis can be a result of low enzyme efficiency against the C-terminal sequence or low column yield of those peptides that are too hydrophilic or small, which passed through the reverse phase column and were not analyzed (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">University Virginia, 2022</xref>). With the high sequence coverage from mass spectrometry analysis and detection of C-terminal sequence in the anti-SEKDEL Western blot, it is confirmed that the PTH-Fc produced transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> is intact. It is worth noting that there is a band right below the intact PTH-Fc band on the anti-SEKDEL Western blot (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1), which is not observed in the anti-PTH Western blot (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 1). Thus, the lower band corresponds to a cleaved PTH-Fc containing the C-terminal sequence (Fc domain) but not the PTH domain. This observation is consistent with a previous study on an Fc fusion protein produced in plants, where proteolytic degradation occurred within the linker domain, especially when the Fc N-glycosylation site was removed making the flexible linker domain more accessible to proteases (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

Under reducing conditions, two distinct bands between 25â37Â kDa were observed, consistent with the anti-SEKDEL Western blot, with a band density distribution of 52 and 48% based on gel densitometry between the higher and lower bands, respectively. The concentration of PTH-Fc in the functional assays described below was based on the intact PTH-Fc only. Under non-reducing conditions, both bands dimerized, forming a wide band between 50 and 75Â kDa that was not fully resolved due to their similar molecular weights. The dimerization of the lower band confirmed that protein cleavage happened within the linker domain, as protein dimerization was driven by the two cysteine residues within the Fc domain right next to the linker sequence.</p>

                <p>To obtain binding kinetics information, sensorgrams are usually fitted to a suitable binding kinetics model. However, in this case, as both association and dissociation happened very fast, mass transfer of protein molecules to the biolayer became the rate limiting step at the curve front, making binding kinetics fitting inaccurate. Thus, a steady state analysis was performed by plotting the average response at the end of the association phase as a function of analyte concentration, to estimate the affinity constant, K<sub>D,</sub> by fitting the curves to <xref rid="e1" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 1</xref>. The steady state analysis results are presented in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>. At the same molar concentration, PTH-Fc elicited a higher response than PTH due to its higher molecular weight. The resulting binding affinity between PTH-Fc and PTH1R was 2.30Â ÂµM, very close to the affinity between PTH and PTH1R (2.31Â ÂµM) (The <italic>p</italic>-value from a Studentâs t-test is 0.96). Those results suggest that the Fc-fusion of PTH-Fc does not interfere the binding capacity of PTH domain, and it binds to PTH1R with a similar affinity as compared to its native form, PTH. This binding affinity assay confirmed the activity of this plant recombinant PTH-Fc on protein level.</p>

              <p>In this study, PTH-Fc, an Fc-fusion of a bone regenerative protein was produced, purified and has its biological function examined in a protein-protein interaction assay and in a cell-based receptor stimulation assay. By designing PTH as an Fc-fusion, the circulatory half-life is expected to increase through interactions with neonatal Fc-receptor (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007</xref>) and lower the renal clearance rate (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Knauf et al., 1988</xref>), which will significantly reduce the injection frequency, making it a potential biologic for space applications. A previous study on PTH-Fc produced in <italic>E coli</italic> demonstrated a 33-fold increase in circulatory half-life compared to PTH (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Kostenuik et al., 2007</xref>). Given the incapability of protein glycosylation in <italic>E coli</italic> and the protein sequence similarity, the plant-recombinant aglycosylated PTH-Fc is expected to have a similar serum half-life to the <italic>E coli</italic> recombinant PTH-Fc produced by Kostenuil et al. In addition, the Fc domain allows for a single step affinity purification of PTH-Fc with no native protein impurities as shown in the SDS-PAGE analysis. However, we have observed protein degradation evidenced by the double band on SDS-PAGE, which is a common issue when the protein of interest contains less structured and flexible regions (the linker) that are often targets of proteases in plant cells (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2012</xref>). Harvesting the protein at an earlier time point might help to increase the percentage of intact protein at the cost of protein yield. For such a target, preserving the glycosylation site can reduce protein degradation by steric hinderance of oligosaccharides. Alternatively, removing or redesigning the linker sequence by avoiding proteolytic sensitive sequences or making the linker less flexible might be beneficial.</p>
              <p>Despite the protein degradation, a significant amount of intact PTH-Fc was produced in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> within 5Â days. The purified protein was confirmed to behave similarly to its native form, PTH (1â34), in the PTH1R binding assay and the PTH1R stimulation CBA. The addition of the Fc domain did not interfere with its binding to PTH1R and such an approach may be applied to other biologics for half-life enhancement and simplifying the protein purification scheme, which is especially valuable under resource constraints, like in space.</p>
              <p>The 33-fold longer serum half-life of PTH-Fc compared with that of PTH (1â34) is beneficial for space medicine to reduce dosing frequency, yet more hypercalcemia was observed with PTH-Fc compared to PTH (1â34) in osteopenic ovariectomized mice and rats (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Kostenuik et al., 2007</xref>). The hypercalcemia may result from the extended serum half-life of PTH-Fc. It is possible to reduce hypercalcemia by combining the PTH-Fc compound with the special absorptive capsule recently developed to increase the rate of gastrointestinal absorption of proteins, including hPTH (1â34) (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">EnteraBio, 2020</xref>). The route of administration should also be considered, as a hPTH (1â34) subcutaneous patch increased bone mass more rapidly than hPTH (1â34) given subcutaneously (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cosman et al., 2010</xref>). Additional studies are needed to understand kinetics of PTH-Fc on bone metabolism.</p>
              <p>On the production platform side, plants are an ideal platform to produce biologics either in the long term by generating stable transgenic plants or on an on-demand basis by transiently expressing biologics <italic>via</italic> agroinfiltration or other DNA delivery methods. With its high level of flexibility and low equipment requirement, plant-based protein expression systems can contribute to making long term space missions safer and more reliable.</p>

              <title>Summary and future perspectives</title>
              <p>In this study, PTH-Fc was produced in plants transiently with an expression level of 373 Â± 59Â mg/kg leaf fresh weight, corresponding to an intact protein level of 192Â mg/kg leaf fresh weight. The protein function was confirmed in the BLI experiment with an affinity to PTH1R of 2.30 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>Â M. In the CBA, PTH-Fc stimulated PTH1R to produce cAMP with an EC<sub>50</sub> of (8.54 Â± 0.12) x 10<sup>â9</sup>Â M. In summary, the plant recombinant PTH-Fc showed similar affinity to PTH1R and a similar potency in a PTH1R activation assay performed on CHO-K1 cells compared to PTH (1â34). To more accurately examine its potency on bone anabolism, cell-based assays using osteoblast cultures and the expression of osteoblast markers such as osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta (RANKL), and procollagen type I N propeptide (PINP) should be evaluated. Preclinical studies will help to determine the efficacy of this novel PTH <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
              <p>To understand and prevent protein degradation, the degraded product should be N-terminal sequenced to identify the cleavage site along with testing new linkers. In addition, targeting the protein to a different subcellular location can have an impact on protein accumulation level as the protease type and level varies among cellular compartments (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Benchabane et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Pillay et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
