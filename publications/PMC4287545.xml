                  <p>Microgravity facilitates the opportunistic infections by augmenting the pathogenic virulence and suppressing the host resistance.

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p>We customized a cell culture module to expose human endothelial cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The assay was carried out onboard the STS-135 spaceflight, and a concurrent ground study constituted the baseline. Transcriptomic investigation revealed a possible immune blunting in microgravity suppressing in particular <italic>Lbp</italic>, <italic>MyD88</italic> and <italic>MD-2</italic>, which encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity, as suggested by the proteomics study. Contrasting proteomic expressions of B2M, TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. Differential expression of miR-200a and miR-146b suggested the susceptibility of hosts in spaceflight to oxidative stress and further underscored the influence of microgravity on the immunity.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p>A molecular interpretation explaining the etiology of the microgravitational impact on the host-pathogen relationship elucidated comprehensive immune blunting of the host cells responding to LPS challenges. Longer LPS exposure prompted a delayed host response, potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistic invasion. Significant consequences include the subsequent failure in recruiting the growth factors and a debilitated apoptosis. Follow up studies with larger sample size are warranted.</p>

              <title>Background</title>
              <p>During spaceflight, astronauts experience a unique set of stressors comprised of microgravity (μG), suboptimal nutrition, social isolation, atypical work environment, solar radiation, and alteration of circadian rhythm. Detrimental consequences were observed in the astronauts’ immune [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and musculoskeletal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and many of the astronauts’ physiological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and cognition phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] were persistently altered long after the missions’terminations. The immunological investigations of the astronauts recorded several dysregulations, such as the altered production of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], enhanced sympathetic neuroimmune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], compromised functions of monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], suppressed cytotoxicity of T-cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and reduced phagocytic capabilities of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A few aspects of immunological disorders such as the alteration of glucocorticoid-mediated immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were observed only after the long-term deployment for the space missions, which could be attributed to the accumulated effect of μG.</p>
              <p>It has long been known that microorganisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> proliferate more rapidly in reduced gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], thereby multiplying the risk of onboard cross-contamination, colonization, and infection. Worse, μG can potentially alter microbial physiology and augment pathogenesis as demonstrated by the studies using simulated μG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Together, host defenses under extraterrestrial stress could be highly susceptible to the opportunistic pathogens armed with their aggressive virulence and rapid proliferative aptitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>A number of <italic>in vitro</italic>, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies probing space-flown biomaterials suggested a potential blunting of the immune response to pathogens and their various derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Of particular interest are the studies that investigated the impact of reduced gravity on the immunological responses to LPS shock. LPS, a common outer membrane component of typical gram-negative bacteria, can elicit strong immune responses in the host cells that may lead to sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The serological responses of the astronauts were governed by the duration of the terrestrial LPS exposure to the whole blood samples <italic>in vitro</italic>. The shorter LPS exposure caused a prolonged elevation of interleukin-1ra (IL-1ra) accompanied by temporary elevations of IL-8 and LPS binding protein (LBP), and suppression of IL-6 and IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; while the longer LPS exposure suppressed the phagocytic activity and reduced the expressions of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and TNF-α that persisted for 7 d after the mission terminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The <italic>in vitro</italic> LPS exposure of spleen cells derived from space-flown C57BL/6j mice resulted in elevated <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-10</italic>, but not <italic>TNF-</italic>α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A rapid onset of LPS-induced apoptosis was observed in squids subjected to simulated μG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>To date, μG-induced immunological perturbations were investigated either by measuring the expressions of inflammatory markers in the space-flown biomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or by presenting the space-flown host cells to the terrestrial endotoxic shock <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The expression analysis of astronauts’ serological markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] was limited by the delay time between the mission termination and the assay initiation, which can potentially be an important time window for the stressed cells to get readjusted to the terrestrial environment. Likewise, inducing the pathogenic shock to the space-flown samples on ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] risked the host-pathogen relationship being critically influenced by the terrestrial bias. These limitations were systematically minimized as we attempted to probe the extraterrestrial impact on the host-pathogen relationships with minimum terrestrial bias.</p>
              <p>The purpose of the present study was to understand the impact of μG on the <italic>in vitro</italic> host immune response to LPS assault. Towards this objective, the endothelial cells primed in the bioreactors were exposed to LPS for 4 h and 8 h at two gravitational limits. The project was integrated and flown under the direction of DoD's Space Test Program. Associated signatures at the genomic and proteomic levels were analyzed. To our knowledge, this is a novel molecular-level approach to assess the host cells infected in spaceflight; although previous studies probed the molecular makeup of pathogens inoculated in the spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recent efforts used modeled μG to investigate the molecular makeups of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The complexity of spaceflight could never be captured, however, by any of such simulated paradigms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p>

                <p>This <italic>in vitro</italic> study used commercially available cell lines, so ethics is not needed.</p>
                <p>Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-dBL; Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were maintained in EGM-2MV growth medium (Lonza, MD) containing growth factors, antimicrobials, cytokines and 5% FBS (all purchased from Lonza, MD) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To avoid phenotypic drift associated with decreasing expression of surface receptor molecules, HMVEC-dBL was not used beyond passage 7. Fibronectin and LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> 055: B5 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).</p>
                <p>We selected a human micro-vascular endothelial cell line because of the manifold involvement of this cell type in the wound healing cascade. At the onset of wound repair, these endothelial cells typically coordinate the recruitment of cytokines and growth factors at the site of injury and subsequently initiate communication with the leukocytes and other tissues to trigger the healing cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
                <p>The Cell Culture Module (CCM) from Tissue Genesis, Inc., Honolulu, HI, is a state-of-art feedback controlled automated platform which was integrated and flown under the direction of DoD's Space Test Program. The CCM was employed with a few modifications to support the cell inoculations and their programmed treatment in spaceflight. This biocompatible module has been used in past space missions as a part of the Space Tissue Loss (STL) program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In the present project, human endothelial cells were inoculated in Extra-Terrestrial Space (ECS), and solutions were injected through the Intra-Terrestrial Space (ICS) of the fibronectin-coated bioreactors following the customized protocol (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Experiment scheme followed in the spaceflight and the concurrent ground study</italic></bold><bold>.</bold> Briefly, each of the two CCMs were loaded with six bioreactors. One CCM was operated in the spaceflight and the other one on ground, concurrently. Both CCMs followed same protocol depicted in the figure; where the top row shows the overall assay sequence segregated into three time zones: (i) the first 10 days, (ii) 11<sup>th</sup> day and (iii) the last 5 days of the space mission. The protocol carried out on the 11<sup>th</sup> day is elaborated inside the box bordered by the broken lines. The cells received typical nourishments during first 10 days of space mission. At the beginning of the 11<sup>th</sup> day, 100 μg/ml LPS were injected to the flowpaths of bioreactors 5 and 6 in both CCMs (arrowhead with LPS 0 h). Four hours later, the same amount of LPS was injected into bioreactor 3 and 4 (arrowhead with LPS 4 h); and after the subsequent four hours, RLT solution was discharged, replacing the media in the flowpaths of all bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (arrowhead with RLT 8 h). The biosamples in the bioreactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in both gravity limits were preserved in the RLT solution till the space shuttle landed 5 days after the RLT discharge. We collected the bioreactors 3 hours after the landing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2014_6776_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e507"/></fig></p>

                <p>Cell Max (Spectrum Labs, Inving, TX), a semi-automated alternative of CCM was used to carry out the preliminary protocol optimization process (details in supplementary data) primarily to define the five following assay parameters. (i) One million cells was identified as the optimum cellular load per fibronectin-coated bioreactor. (ii) The treatment protocol outlined the exposures of 100 μg/ml LPS for 4 h and 8 h (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2). (iii) The RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) was selected as the suitable cell lysing agent and for subsequent preservation of the biomolecules (including RNA) for long periods of time at ambient temperature without causing any comprehensible degradation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S1).</p>

The genes were mined by pair-wise comparison between the LPS-treated samples normalized by the untreated samples inoculated on ground and in spaceflight respectively; for instance, G-4 h and G-8 h were normalized by G-C and S-4 h and S-8 h were normalized by S-C. The close Euclidian proximity of the self-normalized G-C and S-C implies that variance profile of this PCA does not represent the <italic>exclusive</italic> impact of microgravity. A distant clustering between the LPS assault carried out on ground (G-4 h and G-8 h) and that carried out in spaceflight, S-4 h in particular, is marked by PC 1 explaining 80% of total variance. Thereby the impact of microgravity on LPS assault emerges as the most significant factor in explaining the genomic perturbation among these 5,379 genes. Modest Euclidian proximity between S-4 h and S-C (r = 0.16) suggests an immune blunting in spaceflight. Clearly, the host in spaceflight failed to respond to LPS assault.

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The focus of the present study is to find the molecular signatures associated with the host response to LPS mediated by μG. Our primary motivation was attributed to many evidences alleging the pathogenic interference as the major challenge to the space missions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Accompanying evidence supported the extraterrestrial condition as the potent habitat and stimulator of aggressive virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The perennial pathogenic threat may seriously intimidate the future of space missions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; a solution to the problem is therefore exigent.</p>
              <p>The host in μG is likely to counter a dual challenge. The intrinsic challenge is defined by its own immune-compromised state stressed by μG, while pathogens with augmented proliferation and virulence constitute the additional challenge. As a consequence, this atypical opportunistic infection may activate novel bionetworks different from its terrestrial counterparts. The present study was designed to investigate this hypothesis and to our knowledge, this is the first of this kind of attempt, although similar studies have been performed in simulated reduced gravitational environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Comprehensive genomics and transcriptomic studies were purposed to identify key networks involved in extraterrestrial immune response. Putative markers were suggested, although robust validation was beyond the scope of the present project since we probed a small sample size. Further investigations with larger sample sizes are essential.</p>
              <p>In the present study, human microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to LPS for 4 h and 8 h in spaceflight and on ground. The untreated bioreactors processed in both gravitational limits defined the controls for respective gravitational limits. All the assays were performed in duplicate, and concurrently in spaceflight (STS-135, Atlantis launched on July 11<sup>th</sup>, 2011) and on ground (Kennedy Space Center, FL). The ground study mimicked the other elements of the environment of the spaceflight, such as temperature and humidity (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We were limited to use of only six bioreactors in the spaceflight, considerably compromising the power of the study. To overcome the study limitations, we took stringent measures to optimize every aspect of the assay designs detailed in the supplementary section.</p>

                <title>Transcriptomics and biological annotations</title>
                <p>Two orthogonal gene sets were identified from the analyses of the transcriptome microarrays. We carried out a pair-wise moderated t-test routine with cut-off <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, a recommended variance modeling strategy for such a small sample size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The larger gene set consisting of 5,379 transcripts (GoI-LPSμG) was the potential signatures of the host response to <italic>LPS assault mediated by</italic> μ<italic>G</italic>. A smaller set of 2,517 transcripts (GoI-μG) <italic>exclusively altered by</italic> μ<italic>G</italic> suggested that the reduced gravity was potentially a less significant contributor in molecular perturbations as compared to the LPS assault. This methodological decision proposed herein was guided by the hypothesis that μG, LPS assault and their interaction play major roles in perturbing the molecular makeups. The role of the supplementary factors, such as those beyond the experimental control might have been limited by designing a well-regulated experimental strategy.</p>
                <p>The durations of LPS exposure (4 h vs. 8 h) emerged as the less significant factor on ground. G-4 h and G-8 h were positively correlated, but clustered distinctly from the ground control (G-C) depicted by a large Euclidian separation along PC 1 between them (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Of note, the controls on the ground and in spaceflight were spatially closer since they were self-normalized to highlight the impact of gravitational forces on the host responses. A significant Euclidian separation between S-4 h and G-4 h depicted the distinctive characteristics of the host-pathogen relationship in μG. A close proximity between the S-C and S-4 h suggested a compromised <italic>early</italic> response to the endotoxic shock, a potential state of immune blunting. Clearly, the host cells subjected to μG induced stress failed to build resistance against the LPS assault.</p>
                <p>Longer exposure to LPS, however, triggered a delayed response, which possibly allowed the pathogen a critical time window to evade the host resistance. As supporting evidence, immune-compromised mice (<italic>Lbp</italic> −/− and <italic>CD14</italic> −/−) succumbed to fatality caused by gram-negative bacterial infection, despite a delayed response 4 h after the bacterial invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. It is important to note that the diminished host response to LPS was only observed in the space-flown samples. Distinct clustering of G-C from G-4 h and G-8 h (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) conferred μG as a more dominant factor in mediating the immunological response, at least within the time scale probed herein. A pair of data points associated with longer LPS incubation could validate this potential explanation with higher confidence.</p>
                <p>Using the available sample size, a comprehensive annotation pathways (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Figure S5 and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S6, and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S3) was carried out to map the genomic members of GoI-μG and GoI-LPSμG.</p>
                <p>Pathways co-enriched by GoI-μG and GoI-LPSμG are of the particular interest; such as the TLR pathway (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B) that plays a key role in early pathogenic recognition. In accordance to some previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] we observed an exclusive impact of μG in elevating <italic>TLR4</italic>, which potentially triggered the stress-induced downstream apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Lbp</italic> remained suppressed after both 4 h and 8 h exposure in spaceflight and on ground, which could be attributed to the high concentration of LPS administered in this study that typically inhibits TLR4 from recruiting LBP for LPS uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The subsequent delayed elevation of <italic>MyD88</italic> (2.5 log<sub>2</sub> fold change in G-4 h and G-8 h in comparison to G-C; −0.20 in S-4 h and 1.20 in S-8 h in comparison to S-C; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2) and suppression of <italic>MD-2</italic> (2.6 fold change in G-4 h and G-8 h in comparison to G-C; 1.40 in S-4 h and −0.26 in S-8 h in comparison to S-C; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2) further suggested a defect in recognizing LPS in spaceflight. Hereby, μG potentially inhibited the dimerization of TLR-4/MyD88 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and TLR4/MD-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], two critical complexes tasked for early pathogenic recognition. Synergistic suppression of the LPS receptor complexes in spaceflight might have induced temporary LPS tolerance, a characteristic reminiscent of septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The impact cascaded towards impairing downstream apoptosis and the adaptive immune system as the transcripts encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase, TNF receptors and necrosis factors showed temporary suppression, followed by delayed activation induced by LPS insult in spaceflight (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2).</p>
                <p>Two other pathways of interest, namely IL-10 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S6A) and GM-CSF (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Figure S6B), were co-enriched by GoI-μG and GoI-LPSμG. The exclusive impact of μG was silencing of <italic>IL-10</italic> and its receptor (<italic>IL10-Ra</italic>), the anti-inflammatory immune regulators. In contrast, past observations reported elevated <italic>IL-10</italic> in space-flown murine T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; while terrestrial UV radiation inhibited human epidermal IL-10 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p>
                <p>The GM-CSF network primarily controls the production and function of blood cells and regulates a number of key apoptotic networks like PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The transcripts encoding PI3K and AKT were elevated by μG and terrestrial LPS assault. The LPS assault in spaceflight did not enhance their activities after 4 h exposure, possibly leading to compromised cell survival and proliferation consequences.</p>

In consideration of μG as a potential stimulant of oxidative stress primarily induced by depletion of the energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], miR-200a could be a putative signature of the host response to LPS assault mediated by μG.

LPS assault surged the expression of IL-6 and IL-8; while others such as B2M, TIMP-1 MCP-1 and VEGFR failed to respond to the extraterrestrial LPS assault, potentially indicating a state of diminished immunity. Overexpression of VEGFR-1/-2 in μG could be interpreted as a protective measure against UV-induced photo-damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The present study, although compromised by the small sample size, was able to illustrate several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by μG. It was beyond the scope of present paper to probe the pathways with non-immunological implications; although such proposition could have many scientific interests. We created the critical distinguishing features of the present study by implementing the host-pathogen interactions in spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard. Thereby the present study is set characteristically apart from the past reports. In principal, this customized technological maneuver helped us to separate the host-pathogen relationships from the terrestrial bias. The deliverables were the molecular markers <italic>specifically</italic> associated with host responses mediated by μG.</p>
              <p>A synergistic immune blunting was evident in spaceflight. The early pathogenic detection in spaceflight was feeble and delayed which could confer a critical time advantage to the pathogen, facilitating an opportunistic invasion. An <italic>in vivo</italic> study reported fatality caused by very similar time delay in responding to endotoxic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Downstream apoptotic response and growth factor recruitment processes were negatively affected, as well. Impaired healing and defective angiogenesis were other major proteomic findings.</p>
              <p>MicroRNA candidates such as miR-200a and miR-146b are typically associated with oxidative stress and immune regulation, respectively, and were found altered by the LPS assault in spaceflight. A multitude of evidence suggesting μG as a compelling modulator of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and immune suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] further intrigues our interest in these miRNA families identified herein. The significant relationships of these miRNAs to the phenotypic signatures of the extraterrestrial conditions still stands out; despite of the compromised power of the study due to the small sample size. Systematic investigation of these genomic regulators could potentially throw valuable insights into the very young and dynamic field of astrobiology. Taken together, a more comprehensive follow up assessment is necessary to validate the observations presented here. In particular, the elaborate <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with strategic time points beyond the time frame introduced herein and the coherent <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are recommended.</p>

Each flowpath consisted of one bioreactor, one pump, one oxygen chamber (O<sub>2</sub>), one 70 ml media bag and one sump bag. An LPS bag was attached to the flowpath B, depicting the major difference between the two flowpaths, A and B. During the first 10 days of the space mission, the media from the media bags was circulated through the path marked by “Common” (C) and “Normally Open” (NO). On the 11<sup>th</sup> day, the unidirectional “Normally Closed” (NC) paths connecting LPS bags to the bioreactors 5 and 6, respectively, were switched on. Four hours later, LPS was injected to the flowpaths integrated to bioreactors 3 and 4. After the next 4 hours, the media bags were disconnected from the flowpaths by shutting off the associated “Normally Open” (NO) paths. The LPS bags were disconnected, too, by shutting off the respective “Normally Closed” (NC) paths. At the same time, the “Normally Closed” paths linked to the RLT bags and sump bags were switched open in all flowpaths integrated to bioreactors 1 to 6. The consequent arrangement was maintained for the remaining 5 days of the space mission. We obtained nucleic acids and proteins from the bioreactors and media bags, respectively. Sump bags collected proteins, too, but not in an optimum amount to run meaningful studies. (JPEG 49 KB)</p>

                      <p>Additional file 2: Figure S2: <italic>Optimization of LPS concentration and incubation duration</italic>. The cell viability was measured from a series of assays probing cells exposed to a dynamic range of LPS concentrations (0.01-1000 ng/ul) for various durations (2–24 h). The x-axis corresponds to the range of LPS exposure duration and y-axis to the percentage cell viability comparing the time matched control cells. The arrows point out the parameters selected for final experiments (100 μg/ml LPS treatment for 4 h and 8 h). Hereby, two conditions showing little to modest loss of cell viability are selected with the presumption that microgravity would cause further cell damage. Optimum numbers of viable cells are required for carrying out the downstream multi-omics assays. (JPEG 45 KB)</p>

                      <p>Additional file 3: Table S1: <italic>Identification of most suitable cell lysis and nucleic acid fixing buffer.</italic> Six commercially available lysis buffers purchased from three vendors were tested. The integrity and concentration of RNA and DNA extracted from HUVEC-dBL cells were investigated for 15 days suspending the nucleic acids in respective buffer at room temperature. The performances of the buffer candidates were measured compared to RLT solution and ranked. The * marked entries were top 90 percentile candidates. The RNA integrities were probed in the scale of 260/280 and 260/230 ratios and the yields (μg) were used to rank their performances. <bold>Table S2.</bold>
<italic>Gene lists of interest.</italic> Two gene lists are recorded herein, enriched by genes (i) altered by microgravity exclusively (GoI- μG) and (ii) altered by LPS assault mediated by microgravity (GoI-LPSμG). For respective genes the regulation of S-C, G-4 h, G-8 h (all normalized by G-C) and S-4 h and S-8 h (both normalized by S-C) were reported. <bold>Table S3.</bold>
<italic>Pathways of interest.</italic> The pathways were significantly enriched by genes (i) altered by microgravity exclusively and (ii) altered by LPS assault mediated by microgravity. For respective functions the number of participating genes and percentage of enrichment were reported. The pathways were batched under three parent terms (i) cytokine signaling, (ii) apoptosis and (ii) growth factor signaling. <bold>Table S4.</bold>
<italic>The identified list of miRNA and corresponding mRNA targets.</italic> The miRNA-mRNA pairs are curated herein mapping from the gene sets (i) altered by microgravity exclusively (GoI-μG) and (ii) altered by LPS assault mediated by microgravity (GoI-LPSμG). The regulations of S-C (normalized by G-C) were reported for the genomic subsets of GoI- μG. Likewise, the regulations of G-4 h (normalized by G-C) and S-4 h (normalized by S-C) were reported for the genomic subsets of GoI-LPSμG. (DOCX 245 KB)</p>

The intrinsic host response independent of the gravitational shift could be the primary factor in altering these transcriptomic expressions. Likewise, 7,879 genes altered between G-4 h and S-4 h <bold>(Set B)</bold>. The green circle in the lower middle depicts this transcript set. Systematically rejecting the transcripts possibly associated with intrinsic host response and microgravity exclusively, we curated 5,379 molecular signatures of host response to LPS assault mediated by μG (μG x host response to LPS insult) and defined as GoI-LPSμG.
