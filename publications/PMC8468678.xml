                <p>Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1,</italic> from the donor <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter pittii,</italic> were tracked in four recipient strains of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains that were co-cultured with <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub>- and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic>-positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Bacteria are able to adapt to a wide variety of conditions, as evidenced by their survival and growth in extreme environments, such as the arid Atacama desert [<xref rid="B1-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], hypersaline salt mines and lakes [<xref rid="B2-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], acidic rocks in the Yellowstone geothermal environment [<xref rid="B4-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the multi-stressor environment of Antarctica [<xref rid="B5-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bacterial communities have also been found beyond the Earth’s surface on the International Space Station (ISS), a low-gravity, high-radiation, hermetically sealed built environment [<xref rid="B6-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The microbial communities characterized here consist of environmental organisms, human-associated commensal bacteria and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) microbes, resistant to various antibiotics, and carrying numerous anti-microbial resistance genes [<xref rid="B7-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This resistance could potentially pose a serious threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions, as medical attention would not be readily available.</p>
              <p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of genetic material (i.e., DNA) between microorganisms through either transformation, conjugation or transduction, and is considered to be central to microbial evolution [<xref rid="B10-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In dynamic mixed communities, either human or environmental, HGT between species may confer an overall fitness advantage to the community, as the acquisition of new traits in individual cells within that community allows them to better adapt to changing conditions [<xref rid="B12-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In other cases, HGT may have an unfavorable effect if it leads to an excessive accumulation of genes, or a neutral one [<xref rid="B16-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], if there is no impact on the fitness of the organism [<xref rid="B16-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
              <p>In a recent study comparing bacteria from two extreme built environments, one on Earth (Concordia Research Station in Antarctica) and one in space (International Space Station), a comparison between isolates of the same species showed that those from the International Space Station (ISS) had more mobile genetic elements within their genomes than those from Concordia [<xref rid="B17-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a follow-up analysis conducted by our group using the ISS resistome and microbiome data presented by Urbaniak et al. 2018 [<xref rid="B7-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we performed a series of correlation analyses to determine which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were associated with which species. Interestingly, no statistically significant correlations were found. These data, coupled by the Concordia/ISS study, led us to hypothesize that the stressors of the ISS, specifically microgravity, promote enhanced HGT between organisms, compared to what would be observed on Earth.</p>
              <p>To address this hypothesis, co-cultures between donor and recipient strains were grown under simulated microgravity (SMG) (which we used as a proxy for µgravity conditions on the ISS) and normal gravity (1G), using the high-aspect-ratio vessel (HARV), with gene transfer tracked using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The donor and recipient strains were <italic toggle="yes">Acinetobacter pittii</italic> (strain IIF1SW-P1) and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (strains IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW), respectively. All strains were previously isolated from various locations on the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 Tracking study [<xref rid="B8-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> IIF1SW-P1 was chosen as the donor, since it was previously shown by our group to be resistant to oxacillin and contained the chromosomally located <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> gene within its genome [<xref rid="B7-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], a beta-lactamase which alone can confer resistance to oxacillin [<xref rid="B18-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The four <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains, IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW, were chosen as recipients because they were susceptible to oxacillin and harbored neither the <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> gene nor any other beta-lactamase genes [<xref rid="B7-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The donor, <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii,</italic> harbored <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic>, a transposable element that can jump between segments of the genome and, in some cases, can act as a promoter region for <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA</sub> genes, allowing for increased resistance to oxacillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics [<xref rid="B19-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> was not found in either of the recipient <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains. HGT ability was, therefore, tracked between <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> using the AMR genes, <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic>.</p>

                <title>2.1. Co-Culture Experiments</title>
                <p>All strains examined in this study were cultivated from the ISS environment collected during Flight 2 (May 2015) as per the published protocol [<xref rid="B8-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> strain, IIF1SW-P1, was isolated at Location #1, the Port panel of the Cupola. The Cupola is a small module devoted to the observation of operations outside the ISS, such as robotic activities, spacecraft approaches, and extravehicular activities. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain IF4SW was isolated from Location #4, the surface of the dining table. Even though the main function of the table was for dining, crew members also used the table for experimental work. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain IIF6SW was cultured from the sample collected at Location #6, a stowage rack where experimental materials were stored for long duration. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain IF7SW was isolated from Location #7, an overhead three-panel surface of the Materials Science Research Rack 1, which is used for basic material research in the microgravity environment of the ISS. <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strain IIF8SW was retrieved from the samples at Location #8, an exterior aft wall of crew quarters. The crew quarters are a permanent personal space for crewmembers to sleep and perform personal recreation and communication, as well as provide on-orbit stowage of personal belongings.</p>
                <p>Donor (<italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> strain IIF1SW-P1) and recipient (<italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains IF4SW-P1, IIF6SW-P1, IF7SW-P3, IIF8SW-P1) bacteria were streaked from −80 °C freezer stocks onto tryptic soy agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and incubated overnight (~16 h) at 37 °C. A single colony from each plate was added to 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) in a 50 mL Falcon tube for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, and 8 mL of TSB in a snap cap tube for <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> and grown overnight (~20 h) in a shaking incubator at 85 rpm. A low speed was chosen, so as to not dislodge pili or flagella that could be used for HGT, but high enough that the bacteria did not settle out of culture over time. The overnight culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet washed in 1× sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pellets were then resuspended in 10 mL of 1× PBS. For <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, 1 mL was then transferred to 9 mL of PBS and, for <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic>, the tube was topped with 3 mL of PBS. The biomass of the cultures was measured with DENSICHEK<sup>®</sup> (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and adjusted with PBS to reach a concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> cfu/mL, which was then serially diluted to 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/mL. 100 µL of one <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> recipient strain was added to 10 mL of TSB and 100 µL of the donor <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> was added to the same 10 mL tube to set up the co-cultures. After gentle mixing, the complete 10 mL volume containing the donor and recipient was carefully added to HARVs to avoid any bubbles. HARVs were grown under SMG (vertical position) and 1G (horizontal position) at 33 rpm for 20 h at 37 °C.</p>

                <p>After incubation, the liquid from each HARV vessel was collected and 100 µL, in duplicate, was plated on MSA (selective for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>) (VWR, Radnor, PA, USA), MSA+ 4 µg/mL oxacillin sodium salt monohydrate (VWR, USA) (selective for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> that had become resistant to oxacillin) and Leeds agar (selective for <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic>) (VWR, USA). MSA and Leeds plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and MSA+ oxacillin plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Colonies on MSA, MSA+ oxacillin, and Leeds plates were counted, and cfu/mL was calculated. Colonies that grew on MSA+ oxacillin plates were picked and placed in 250 µL 1× PBS and stored at 4 °C until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep Kit (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

              <p>In order to determine whether HGT occurred between donor and recipient, suitable PCR primers were designed to amplify regions of the <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> genes from <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> IIF1SW-P1. The sequences of the two genes, used to design the primers, were extracted from the draft whole-genome sequence of <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> IIF1SW-P1 [<xref rid="B21-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. PCR analysis performed on DNA isolated from <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> IIF1SW-P1 using the designed <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> primers showed strong bands on an agarose gel, while PCR analysis performed on DNA isolated from the four <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> strains showed no amplicons.</p>
              <p>To compare HGT potential between SMG and 1G, co-cultures of <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> (donor strain) and <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> (recipient strain) were grown in the HARV under SMG (vertical rotation) or 1G (horizontal rotation) for 20 h, after which the culture was plated on mannitol salt agar (MSA) to select for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>. The MSA was also supplemented with oxacillin to select only those <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> colonies that had acquired resistance to the antibiotic. To verify that this newly acquired resistance to oxacillin was not due to spontaneous mutations but rather through the HGT of <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> from <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic>, the <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> colonies that grew on MSA supplemented with oxacillin were picked for PCR analysis. A schematic of the experimental set-up is shown in <xref rid="life-11-00960-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
              <p><xref rid="life-11-00960-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the proportion of colonies that grew on MSA supplemented with oxacillin that were positive for <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> (<xref rid="life-11-00960-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> (<xref rid="life-11-00960-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B) and both (<xref rid="life-11-00960-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>C). Representative gel images are shown in <xref rid="app1-life-11-00960" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>. On average, 77% of the <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> colonies that were grown with <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> under SMG and had acquired resistance to oxacillin now harbored both <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> (89% of the colonies had acquired at least one). This is in contrast with 1G, where only 1% of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> colonies that had acquired oxacillin resistance were positive for both <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> (8% of the colonies had acquired at least one).</p>
              <p>The differences in proportions observed between SMG and 1G were not due to differences in growth at these different conditions, as each strain showed the same biomass after 20 h, whether grown under SMG or 1G (<xref rid="app1-life-11-00960" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
              <p>The efficiency of transfer under SMG for all four strains was, on average, 3.06 × 10<sup>−7</sup> while, for 1G, it was 3.21 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (<xref rid="life-11-00960-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While all strains had similar efficiencies, IIF8SW had the highest and IIF6SW the lowest.</p>
              <p>To determine how stable these donor genes were in the recipient, two resistant <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> 1F4SW colonies that had acquired both genes were sub-cultured on MSA + oxacillin plates, a total of four times. Even after the 4th sub-culture, the colonies were still resistant to oxacillin, and PCR confirmed that <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic> were still present within the genome.</p>

              <title>4. Discussion</title>
              <p>We have shown that HGT is increased under SMG compared to 1G. The transfer of AMR genes, which were tracked by PCR, occurred in the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics. This transfer led to functional changes, as the acquisition of the two AMR genes, <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">ISAba1</italic>, that were tracked in the four strains of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, made them resistant to oxacillin, to which they were previously susceptible. These results have significant implications for long-duration space missions because pathogens that are susceptible to antibiotics could become resistant and thus harder to treat. In addition, even if astronauts are screened for problematic microbes prior to flight, issues could still arise, as commensals are known to act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be disseminated to (opportunistic) pathogens [<xref rid="B22-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, a study conducted in a hospital in the Netherlands showed that <italic toggle="yes">mecA</italic> gene transfer occurred in a patient between <italic toggle="yes">mecA</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic> and a <italic toggle="yes">mecA</italic><sup>−</sup> strain of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> [<xref rid="B25-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>It was beyond the scope of the study to determine the cause of the increased HGT that was observed, but one mechanism could be increased competence, allowing for transformation to occur, one of three modes of gene transfer. Competence allows bacterial cells to uptake DNA from its environment and increase the response to different stressors [<xref rid="B26-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this case, naked DNA released from dead <italic toggle="yes">A. pittii</italic> cells could have been readily taken up by <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> when exposed to SMG due to an increase in its competence. While <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> is not classically considered to be naturally competent, as <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic> are, it does harbor genes that are involved in competence and thought to promote natural competence under the right conditions [<xref rid="B30-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The conditions that <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> needs are not yet known, but, similar to other bacteria, it could be an adverse environment. Indeed, when <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> cells were subjected to heat-shock, cold-shock and the stringent response, there was increased expression of competence gene orthologs compared to the non-stressed conditions [<xref rid="B32-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">B. subtilis</italic>, competence confers a survival advantage when cells are subjected to stress [<xref rid="B33-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], so there is a possibility that growth under SMG led to an adverse environment for <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, causing cells to become more competent to increase survival. Conjugation is a less likely scenario since, consistent with what others have documented in the literature, <italic toggle="yes">bla</italic><sub>OXA-500</sub> is located on the chromosome and not a plasmid. A second mechanism could be increased transduction caused by growth under SMG. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material via bacterial phages. It is well known that prophage activity is increased during stress, leading to increased phage production, helping the host survive these adverse conditions [<xref rid="B35-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-life-11-00960" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>

              <p>This paper describes, for the first time, the effects of SMG on HGT and has shown that it is increased in SMG compared to 1G. If the same trend is observed on the ISS, this will have a significant impact on how we view bacterial interactions in space and its effects on astronaut health. The next steps would be to elucidate the mechanisms behind the HGT, to develop appropriate countermeasures for long-duration space missions.</p>
