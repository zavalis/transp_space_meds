              <abstract>
                <p>Astronauts return to Earth from spaceflight missions with impaired mobility and balance; recovery can last weeks postflight. This is due in large part to the altered vestibular signaling and sensory reweighting that occurs in microgravity. The neural mechanisms of spaceflight-induced vestibular changes are not well understood. Head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) is a common spaceflight analog environment that allows for study of body unloading, fluid shifts, and other consequences of spaceflight. Subjects in this context still show vestibular changes despite being in Earth’s gravitational environment, potentially due to sensory reweighting. Previously, we found evidence of sensory reweighting and reduced neural efficiency for vestibular processing in subjects who underwent a 70-day HDBR intervention. Here we extend this work by evaluating the impact of HDBR paired with elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to mimic International Space Station conditions on vestibular neural processing. Eleven participants (6 males, 34 ± 8 years) completed 30 days of HDBR combined with 0.5% atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>). Participants underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> while we measured brain activity in response to pneumatic skull taps (a validated method of vestibular stimulation). We also measured mobility and balance performance several times before and after the intervention. We found support for adaptive neural changes within the vestibular system during bed rest that subsequently recovered in several cortical and cerebellar regions. Further, there were multiple brain regions where greater pre- to post- <italic>deactivation</italic> was associated with <italic>reduced</italic> pre- to post- balance declines. That is, increased <italic>deactivation</italic> of certain brain regions associated with <italic>better</italic> balance post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. We also found that, compared to HDBR alone (<italic>n</italic> = 13 males; 29 ± 3 years) HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> is associated with greater increases in activation of multiple frontal, parietal, and temporal regions during vestibular stimulation. This suggests interactive or additive effects of bed rest and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we found stronger correlations between pre- to post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> brain changes and dependence on the visual system during balance for subjects who developed signs of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). Together, these findings have clear implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of bed rest and spaceflight-related changes in vestibular processing, as well as adaptation to altered sensory inputs.</p>

              <p>Microgravity exposure poses unique challenges to human physiology: astronauts encounter body unloading, headward fluid shifts, altered vestibular and proprioceptive inputs, inflight and postflight spatial disorientation (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 1984</xref>), and confined quarters with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels up to more than ten times higher than those on Earth (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Law et al., 2014</xref>). Upon return to Earth, astronauts present with multi-systemic consequences, such as declining bone (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Sibonga, 2013</xref>) and muscle mass (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">LeBlanc et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Stein, 2013</xref>), cardiovascular changes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hargens and Richardson, 2009</xref>), and mobility and balance difficulties (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mulavara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2015</xref>). Here we focus on the neural vestibular consequences of a spaceflight analog environment, as well as the neural mechanisms underlying declines in vestibularly mediated mobility and balance.</p>
              <p>Animal studies have demonstrated peripheral vestibular changes with spaceflight; for instance, utricular afferents become hypersensitive to translational accelerations after return to Earth (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al., 2001</xref>). Although the specific mechanisms for these changes remain unknown, one possibility is that the brain reinterprets afferent sensory input during flight due to the lack of a gravitational reference vector for the otoliths. After return to Earth, this re-interpretation is in conflict with Earth’s gravitational environment and results in postflight vestibular dysfunction (e.g., balance difficulties), followed by slow re-adaptation over the days and weeks following spaceflight (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Young et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Parker et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Mulavara et al., 2010</xref>). Astronauts also present with decreased skin sensitivity on the soles of the feet following spaceflight (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lowrey et al., 2014</xref>), which has been attributed to in-flight sensory reweighting (i.e., the process of adjusting the magnitude of different sensory contributions to motor control) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Assländer and Peterka, 2014</xref>) in compensation for unreliable vestibular inputs in microgravity. A single-subject case study (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Demertzi et al., 2016</xref>) and recent study of 11 cosmonauts (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pechenkova et al., 2019</xref>) examining resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity found evidence for vestibular cortex reorganization and multisensory reweighting following long-duration spaceflight. This work provides preliminary evidence of flight-related central vestibular plasticity. Taken together, it is likely that spaceflight factors influence the neural correlates of vestibular processing; however, the precise mechanisms underlying such changes require further study.</p>
              <p>Head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) is a common spaceflight analog intervention that permits ground-based study of how axial body unloading alters sensory inputs that subsequently impact neural vestibular processing and vestibular system plasticity. Subjects remain in bed with their head tilted down six degrees to mimic a subset of spaceflight consequences including headward fluid shifts, arterial pressure changes, axial body unloading, and reduced somatosensory input. Although gravitational vector input does not change during HDBR, there is evidence that, similar to spaceflight, axial body unloading contributes to sensory reweighting (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mulavara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>). Even though HDBR does not directly affect vestibular inputs, sensory reweighting is thought to affect neural vestibular processing during HDBR; more specifically, the vestibular nuclei receive inputs from the vestibular organs, in addition to proprioceptive signals from the limbs (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fredrickson et al., 1966</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al., 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Yates et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Jian et al., 2002</xref>). If either vestibular or somatosensory inputs appear to be incorrect or abnormal, the central nervous system may use information from the other system to compensate and maintain performance (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bles et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dieringer, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Horak and Hlavacka, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Carriot et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, during HDBR, in the absence of normal somatosensory inputs to the foot, vestibular processing appears to be altered, with vestibular cues weighted more heavily (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mulavara et al., 2018</xref>). HDBR also results in reduced functional mobility and decreased postural stability, which are both behaviors that depend upon the vestibular system and multisensory integration (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Reschke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mulder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Koppelmans et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Mulavara et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, taken together, HDBR provides an effective environment for studying neural vestibular adaptation and has applications for both space travel and for better understanding plasticity of the vestibular system and multisensory integration.</p>
              <p>In recent years, several fMRI-compatible vestibular stimulation methods, including auditory tone bursts and pneumatic skull taps, have been used to map central vestibular processing networks (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Schlindwein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2017</xref>). Two meta-analyses have revealed a diffuse vestibular processing network, including portions of insular cortex, premotor cortex, inferior parietal cortex, cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal gyri (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Zu Eulenburg et al., 2012</xref>). However, the most commonly activated regions across several different vestibular stimulation methods were the parietal opercular area (“OP2”) and retroinsular cortex; consequently, these regions are sometimes referred to as “vestibular cortex,” and considered to be the core regions responsible for vestibular processing. In the present work, we stimulated the vestibular system during fMRI using pneumatic skull taps, which we have previously validated in young (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2017</xref>) and older adults (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2019</xref>), and successfully employed in our past HDBR work (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>). Pneumatic skull taps elicit both activation in the vestibular cortex and deactivation in cross-modal sensory regions. Across both young and older adults, we have found associations between greater <italic>deactivation</italic> of certain subcortical and cerebellar regions in response to vestibular stimulation and <italic>better</italic> static balance performance (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests the importance of both brain activation and deactivation, potentially reflecting sensory reweighting, for successful vestibular functioning.</p>
              <p>In our past HDBR work, using this skull tap technique, we identified longitudinal brain changes suggestive of upregulation of vestibular processing in response to reduced somatosensory input during 70 days of HDBR (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>). We also found associations between increased frontal, parietal, and occipital brain activity and greater HDBR-related mobility and balance declines, suggestive of reduced neural efficiency post-HDBR (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>). Further, we identified post-HDBR increases in resting state connectivity for a network including the vestibular cortex and the cerebellum (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cassady et al., 2016</xref>). These findings indicate that the neural correlates of vestibular processing are altered with HDBR and have functional implications for vestibularly mediated behaviors.</p>
              <p>No previous work has investigated the neural correlates of vestibular processing during an intervention combining HDBR with elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, which would better mimic the actual conditions on the International Space Station (ISS). Among other effects, exposure to heightened CO<sub>2</sub> increases blood flow to the brain (at least initially) due to cerebral vasodilation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>) and mildly impairs visuomotor function (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Manzey and Lorenz, 1998</xref>). Although <italic>reduced</italic> blood levels of CO<sub>2</sub> during voluntary hyperventilation have been associated with increased postural sway (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sakellari et al., 1997</xref>), it is unknown how <italic>elevated</italic> atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> interacts with central or peripheral vestibular processing.</p>
              <p>Here we used fMRI to test changes in the neural response to vestibular stimulation with 30 days of HDBR paired with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (which we refer to as “HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>”). We hypothesized that similar brain changes would emerge compared to our past work (referred to as “HDBR”), including evidence for HDBR-related upregulation of vestibular networks and reduced neural efficiency. Further, we anticipated that the interaction of HDBR and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> would result in additive neural effects.</p>
              <p>We addressed three primary aims in this small pilot sample (<italic>n</italic> = 11): (1) assess the time course of changes in the neural correlates of vestibular processing and recovery patterns with HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>; (2) examine the functional consequences of HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> by associating brain changes with mobility and balance declines; and (3) characterize how HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> differentially affects the neural correlates of vestibular processing compared to HDBR alone. We developed an additional, exploratory aim (4) after about half of the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> subjects developed signs of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Laurie et al., 2019</xref>), a condition which manifests with symptoms such as optic disk edema and is estimated to affect between approximately 16 and 50 percent of long-duration astronauts (i.e., those who have completed an ISS mission, which typically last for about 6 months) (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Stenger et al., 2017</xref>). We characterized subgroup differences between those HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> subjects who did and did not develop signs of SANS.</p>

                  <p>For both the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and the HDBR cohorts, subjects received vestibular stimulation during fMRI. Subjects received skull taps via a pneumatic tactile pulse system [MR-compatible Pn Tactile Pulse System (PnTPS), Engineering Acoustics Inc.] placed over the lateral cheekbones (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>). The skull tapper used compressed air (50–55 psi) to power a small piston that delivered low-force taps (0.6 kg) to the cheekbone. We have recently shown that this approach is well tolerated by subjects, it activates vestibular cortical regions, it results in vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in eye muscles, and it does not cause excessive head motion (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
                  <p>Taps were delivered at 1 Hz, and each tapping block contained 24 taps. Both groups completed one fMRI run with five 24-s blocks of taps on the left cheekbone. Each block of taps was preceded and followed by 20-s rest periods. The HDBR group also completed a second run with taps to the right cheekbone; however, here we examine only the HDBR left tap run to enable direct comparison to the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group. Of note, although the vestibular stimulation parameters and total sequence duration were identical between groups, as the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> fMRI sequence included a faster TR and more volumes (TR = 2.5 s; 96 volumes) than the HDBR sequence (TR = 3.66 s; 66 volumes), we acquired more data and thus had more statistical power for the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group. This represents a potential limitation of the present work and is discussed further in Section “Limitations.”</p>
                  <p>For both groups, the force of the taps was sufficiently low that they did not induce head motion that was greater than for other task runs. No subject moved more than 2.1 mm within any run, which is smaller than the size of one voxel.</p>

We used a standard SPM preprocessing pipeline for fMRI (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner et al., 2016</xref>). All functional images were corrected for slice timing then realigned and resliced to correct for head motion. As an additional quality check, we used the Artifact Detection Tool (ART)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote1">1</xref></sup> with motion threshold = 2.5 mm and global brain signal Z threshold = 9. There were no within-session movement outliers for either group.

                  <p>After resetting the origins of each T1 image to the anterior commissure, the T1 images were coregistered to the mean functional image with separation of [2, 1 mm].

The forward deformation fields from the T1 segmentation were used to normalize the functional images and the T1 to MNI space. We used 7th degree B-spline normalization for optimal performance (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ashburner et al., 2016</xref>).

                  <title>Correlations of Brain and Behavioral Changes With HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub></title>
                  <p>We computed brain activation differences during vestibular stimulation between the final pre- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> time point (BDC 7) and the final time point during HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> (HDT 29). We also computed the change in mobility and balance scores from BDC 7 to the first post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> time point, R0. To examine regions in which HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> brain changes were associated with changes in mobility and balance performance, we used a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test model controlling for age and sex and included the behavioral change score as a covariate of interest. For each model, we used the Statistical Non-Parametric Mapping (SnPM version 13)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote2">2</xref></sup> (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nichols and Holmes, 2002</xref>) toolbox to run non-parametric permutation tests with 15,000 permutations, variance smoothing = 8 mm kernel for the whole brain analyses and 2 mm kernel for the cerebellar analyses, minimum cluster size = 10 voxels, and threshold = non-parametric <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005 (uncorrected). The SnPM toolbox is recommended for studies with small sample sizes that may not meet assumptions for parametric testing. The SnPM toolbox calculates pseudo <italic>t</italic>-statistic images and uses non-parametric permutation testing to assess for significance.</p>

                  <title>HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> vs. HDBR Group Comparisons</title>
                  <p>To examine differences in neural response to vestibular stimulation between bed rest with and without elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, we compared both baseline (i.e., intercept) differences between the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR groups, as well as the slope of change in brain activation across bed rest. As each cohort followed a different testing timeline, we compared the three time points that fell the closest together in time between the groups (indicated by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As in our previous work (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>), we calculated a regression intercept and slope for each person using the scans from these three time points. The last image collected before the start of HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> or HDBR was treated as time = 0 days, assuming that pre-bed rest activation was stable. Calculating the regression intercept allowed us to examine baseline differences between groups, and calculating the regression slope allowed us to compare the rate of change in brain activation during vestibular stimulation between groups.</p>
                  <p>We used two sample <italic>t</italic>-tests to examine between-group differences in intercept and slope images. For all group comparisons, we used SnPM non-parametric permutation tests with 15,000 permutations, variance smoothing = 8 mm kernel for whole brain analyses and 2 mm kernel for cerebellar analyses, minimum cluster size = 10 voxels, and threshold = non-parametric <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005 (uncorrected). In each model, we accounted for age and sex differences. We excluded two individuals from the HDBR cohort from group analyses: one individual had severe artifacts in their HDT 50 scan, and another individual had abnormally high contrast values at the single-subject level, possibly also due to artifacts. Thus there were <italic>n</italic> = 11 subjects per group for group comparisons.</p>
                  <p>There were several differences between the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR images. Images were collected on different scanners, HDBR images showed evidence of greater orbitofrontal dropout compared to HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> images, and HDBR individuals presented with slightly smaller ventricles. To address this and remain conservative in our analyses, we do not report any between-group orbitofrontal results, and we report with caution one between-group result in close proximity to the ventricles. As these two groups represent highly unique cohorts who have undergone a rare, intensive bed rest intervention with nearly identical behavioral and neuroimaging protocols, we feel that it is still valuable to report on group differences between these two cohorts, although the results of these specific analyses should be interpreted with caution. As we previously reported on longitudinal neural vestibular changes and brain-behavior correlations for the HDBR group (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>), the only HDBR results reported here are the group differences between HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR.</p>

                  <title>SANS Versus No-SANS Group Comparisons</title>
                  <p>We performed two exploratory analyses to examine group differences between those HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> subjects who developed signs of SANS (SANS; <italic>n</italic> = 5; two males, three females) and those who did not (no-SANS; <italic>n</italic> = 6; four males, two females). First, we tested for differences between the intercept and slope images for each group. We conducted two-sample parametric <italic>t</italic>-tests with threshold <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005, <italic>k</italic> = 10. Non-parametric testing would not have been possible here, as less than 500 permutations exist for this combination of sample sizes.</p>
                  <p>Next, we tested for regions where the SANS versus no-SANS groups showed differences in the correlation between pre- to post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> brain change and pre- to post- change in the ratio between the balance—eyes open and balance—eyes closed condition. This ratio score was calculated as: (balance—eyes open score/balance—eyes closed score) <sup>∗</sup>100 and provides a metric of the degree to which an individual relies on vision for maintaining quiet upright stance. Each of these balance tasks is described in Section “Balance Testing.” We selected to compare brain-behavior correlations only for this ratio score here because we previously identified significant differences between the two SANS subgroups on this measure, in which SANS individuals showed <italic>greater increases</italic> from pre- to post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> in their reliance on vision during balance compared to no-SANS individuals (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019a</xref>). One of the five SANS subjects was excluded from this analysis due to outlier values for the balance—eyes closed condition (described in Section “Balance Testing”). Thus there were <italic>n</italic> = 4 for the SANS group and <italic>n</italic> = 6 for the no-SANS group.</p>

The FMT requires subjects to arise from a seated position and walk through a 6-m × 4-m two-part obstacle course consisting of foam hurdles, pylons, and bars. The first part of the course was completed on a hard floor, and the second part was completed on medium-density foam. Participants were instructed to walk through the course as quickly as possible without touching any of the obstacles. Participants repeated the FMT 10 times per session on five different testing days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Here we analyze only the total time needed to complete the course for the first trial of each session, as we have found this measure to be the most sensitive to intervention-related change. We excluded one subject from FMT analyses, as the subject showed substantial pre- to post- slowing (&gt; ± 2.5 standard deviations from the group average pre- to post- change) and exerted considerable influence on group-level statistics. Thus there were <italic>n</italic> = 10 subjects for analyses involving FMT.</p>

                  <p>Participants completed three balance tasks: (1) balance—eyes open; (2) balance—eyes closed; and (3) balance—eyes closed dynamic head tilt. Details of these tasks have been previously described (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mulder et al., 2014</xref>). Participants stood on a foam pad on top of a force platform (Leonardo Mechanograph, Novotec Medical GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). Participants were instructed to maintain a comfortable stance, keep their arms folded across their chest and remain in a stable, upright posture for 30 s. Foot markers on the foam pad were used to ensure consistent foot placement across trials and between subjects. For the first two conditions, participants kept their head erect and eyes either open or closed. For the eyes closed dynamic head tilt condition, participants kept their eyes shut and made head pitch motions of ±20°, synchronized to a 0.33 Hz metronome tone. Participants repeated all conditions three times during each testing session, and the order of conditions was semi-randomized to ensure that identical conditions did not repeat back-to-back. To minimize the effect of outlier trials, for each condition we examined the median score of the three trials. Scores are reported as equilibrium quotients (EQ), where 100% is a perfect score. EQ scores were calculated using instantaneous anterior-to-posterior peak-to-peak center-of-mass sway angle. For the eyes closed condition only, we excluded one subject, as the subject showed pre- to post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> declines &gt; ± 2 standard deviations from the group average and exerted considerable influence on group-level statistics. Thus there were <italic>n</italic> = 10 subjects for analyses involving balance-eyes closed scores, but there were <italic>n</italic> = 11 subjects for all other balance analyses.</p>

In R 3.5.1 (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">R Core Team, 2013</xref>), using the last pre- bed rest time point (BDC 7) and the end of bed rest time point (HDT 29), we calculated a slope of pre- to post- performance change for each subject and conducted a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test to determine if the group-average slope was different from 0. We also examined post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> recovery trajectories for the three post-bed rest time points using a linear mixed model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation via the “lme” function. The model included a random intercept for subject (to allow for different starting points for each person) and the fixed effect of time. In each case, we were interested in whether the fixed effect of time was significant; we tested a quadratic fit for time for each measure as well, but the model including the linear effect of time performed better in all cases.</p>

                <p>Several other regions showed patterns of fast change, with changes sustaining throughout HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and not restoring until after the conclusion of bed rest.

                  <p>This relationship between <italic>greater deactivation</italic> and <italic>reduced</italic> behavioral decline held across the majority of brain regions that showed significant brain—behavior correlations, including sensorimotor cortex (i.e., supplementary motor area and postcentral gyrus), temporal cortex, occipital cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum (particularly, anterior cerebellum and crus I and II). In several cases, increased deactivation was found in regions that typically <italic>deactivate</italic> during vestibular stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); for instance, this was the case for supplementary motor area, postcentral gyrus, and occipital gyrus (i.e., clusters marked with superscript “d” in <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p>
                  <p>There were only a few regions where <italic>reduced</italic> pre- to post- <italic>deactivation</italic> was more beneficial for post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> mobility and balance performance. For instance, in the case of right cerebellar lobule VIIb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>), <italic>decreased deactivation</italic> from pre- to post- was associated with <italic>less</italic> FMT slowing (i.e., less decline). Similarly, for the balance—eyes closed dynamic head tilt condition, <italic>less deactivation</italic> from pre- to post- in left cerebellar crus II was associated with <italic>less</italic> balance decline.</p>

Although no regions here overlapped with brain areas from the main effect analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), these clusters were located in close proximity to regions that are expected to show <italic>deactivation</italic> during vestibular stimulation. In general, the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group showed <italic>increases in activation</italic> of these regions over the course of bed rest, as well as more within-group variability in neural response, compared to the HDBR group who generally showed <italic>increases in deactivation</italic> of these regions over the course of bed rest. For instance, in the left middle frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>), the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> subjects showed a switch from <italic>deactivation</italic> of this region during vestibular stimulation at BDC 7 to <italic>activation</italic> of this region at HDT 29. The HDBR group showed the opposite pattern, changing from <italic>activation</italic> to <italic>deactivation</italic> of this region.</p>

                <p>Five of the 11 HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> participants developed signs of SANS, including optic disc edema. While this phenomenon is commonly reported following spaceflight (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), this is the first bed rest study to induce such effects (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Laurie et al., 2019</xref>), possibly due to the careful testing for SANS symptoms and the strict head-down-tilt conditions, or the addition of elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. As SANS was not anticipated <italic>a priori</italic> but represents a substantial subgroup of the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> cohort, we conducted two exploratory analyses of this unique sample.</p>
                <p>At <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005 and <italic>k</italic> = 10, there were no regions of intercept or slope difference between the SANS and no-SANS participants. We previously found that SANS individuals increased their reliance on visual information during balance from pre- to post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019a</xref>); that is, SANS subjects had greater increases in their ratio of eyes open balance compared to eyes closed balance. Here we identified multiple frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions where the SANS subjects showed stronger correlations with this balance ratio score compared to the no-SANS subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). For instance, SANS subjects showed a stronger correlation between <italic>greater activation</italic> of left middle frontal gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) and <italic>increased</italic> pre- to post- balance ratio score. Several of these clusters included regions typically activated during vestibular stimulation (indicated with a superscript “d” in <xref rid="T7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). There were no regions of stronger correlation for the no-SANS subjects.</p>

                <p>Here we identified changes in the neural correlates of vestibular processing with 30 days of HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. We found multiple regions where brain activation during vestibular stimulation changed quickly after participants started HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and recovered either during or post-bed rest, providing support for adaptive plasticity of the vestibular system in response to altered sensory inputs. In multiple cases, <italic>increased deactivation</italic> of cortical and cerebellar areas was associated with <italic>less</italic> decline in balance from pre- to post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that some of the adaptive neural changes during bed rest may benefit post-bed rest performance of vestibularly mediated behaviors. We found several differences for HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> compared to HDBR subjects, suggesting interactive or additive effects of bed rest and CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we noted differences in brain—behavior relationships for SANS versus no-SANS subjects, indicating the need for further study of bed rest-induced ocular symptoms.</p>

                <title>Time Course of Neural Vestibular Response to HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub></title>
                <p>Similar to our past work (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>), we found multiple longitudinal changes in the neural response to vestibular stimulation, including in several areas in close proximity to regions typically involved in processing vestibular information, as well as in several regions that are not normally activated during vestibular stimulation. These responses could represent adaptive plasticity, in which the enhanced demands of neural processing of altered sensory inputs during HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> are requiring greater neural resources. For instance, the finding of <italic>decreased deactivation</italic> in right superior medial gyrus and right cerebellar lobule VI (which are anatomically near to regions that, on average, deactivated in response to vestibular stimulation) suggests a compensatory response. That is, functional brain regions that typically deactivate in response to vestibular input are deactivating <italic>less</italic> during exposure to an altered sensory environment, potentially to allow for additional brain pathways to aid in processing the novel sensory information. Here, more specifically, it could be that down-weighting of somatosensory input during HDBR, paired with upweighting of vestibular input due to vestibular-somatosensory convergence at the vestibular nuclei (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mulavara et al., 2012</xref>), is resulting in a higher neural processing demand. The fast recovery of several of these regions <italic>during</italic> bed rest suggests an ability of the vestibular system to adjust rapidly to such altered sensory conditions.</p>
                <p>In contrast to our past work (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>), we did not identify any unique regions of slow, cumulative brain changes; instead, we found clusters that were statistically significant for both the immediate and cumulative models. This suggests that interactive effects of CO<sub>2</sub> with bed rest might accelerate neural vestibular changes. It could also be that CO<sub>2</sub>-related increases in cerebral perfusion enhanced the BOLD signal (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Corfield et al., 2001</xref>) for HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> participants, making it easier to detect bed rest-related changes earlier during that intervention. Further, given that the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> intervention was about half the duration of the HDBR intervention, it could be that some of the slow, cumulative brain changes that we previously identified require longer than 30 days to develop.</p>
                <p>Previously we found that HDBR resulted in upregulation of the vestibular system (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>), which we attributed to either increased sensitivity of the vestibular system during HDBR or to reduced neural efficiency, in which greater activation of vestibular cortical regions would be needed to process vestibular information during HDBR. Here, we did not find clear evidence for reduced neural efficiency (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>). That is, we did not identify any HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>-related <italic>increases</italic> in activation of vestibular cortical regions. This suggests that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> may augment vestibular processing, as this environment did not produce the same longitudinal reduction in neural efficiency as HDBR alone.</p>

                <title>Functional Behavioral Implications</title>
                <p>We identified predominantly regions for which <italic>increased</italic> pre- to post- <italic>deactivation</italic> during vestibular stimulation associated with <italic>reduced</italic> balance performance decline, or even performance improvement. This may represent adaptive plasticity during the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> intervention, in which some individuals show an enhancement of the expected cortical deactivation response, paired with a dampening of activity in other brain regions that could interfere with processing of vestibular information. This adaptive change could then later manifest as superior post-bed rest balance due to underlying increased specificity of activation of vestibular cortex and deactivation of other sensory regions during the balance tasks. More specifically, it could be that the reduced plantar somatosensory input during HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> results in down-weighting of somatosensory input, but upweighting of vestibular input. While this reweighting is likely modulated at the level of the vestibular nuclei where the somatosensory and vestibular systems converge (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bles et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dieringer, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Horak and Hlavacka, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Carriot et al., 2015</xref>), this reorganization could plausibly manifest as increased deactivation of cortical sensorimotor processing regions, with those individuals who had the most successful reweighting processes presenting with enhanced preservation of balance abilities post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. Given these possible mechanisms, it thus makes sense that we found the most numerous brain-behavior correlations for the eyes closed dynamic head tilt condition, as this condition most specifically tasks the vestibular system.</p>
                <p>We similarly found evidence of brain-behavioral relationships in our past HDBR work for vestibular processing (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018b</xref>) and for neural control of foot movement (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2018a</xref>). Further, we previously identified several regions for which <italic>better</italic> balance (i.e., reduced postural sway while standing on one leg) correlated with <italic>greater deactivation</italic> of the brainstem, cerebellar lobule VI, and crus I and II across healthy young and older adults at one time point (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Noohi et al., 2019</xref>). This fits with the present work, as here we found several brainstem and cerebellar regions for which <italic>greater</italic> post-bed rest <italic>deactivation</italic> associated with <italic>better</italic> balance. Together, these findings provide further support for the notion that those with a more refined neural response to vestibular stimulation in the scanner (e.g., including <italic>greater deactivation</italic> of brainstem and cerebellum) likely also produce a more refined neural response during balance tasks outside of the scanner and therefore perform better.</p>
                <p>Similarly, several mobile neuroimaging studies have identified that older adults exhibit poorer balance paired with <italic>increased</italic> brain activation during vestibular stimulation (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Karim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. (2017)</xref> found greater activation in frontal and occipital regions during vestibular stimulation for older compared to middle-aged adults. This suggests compensatory processes in which older adults require greater neural resources to process the same vestibular information. This fits with the present findings, as those who had the largest post-bed rest balance declines also showed bed rest-related <italic>increases in activation</italic> or <italic>reductions in deactivation</italic> across various cortical regions, including frontal and occipital regions. It could be that, similar to older adults, these individuals were recruiting extra brain regions to aid in processing vestibular information in the scanner and then engaging similar compensatory over-recruitment mechanisms outside the scanner during the post-bed rest balance assessments, which ultimately resulted in poorer balance performance.</p>

                <title>HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> vs. HDBR Group Comparisons</title>
                <p>CO<sub>2</sub>-specific effects or interactive effects of bed rest and CO<sub>2</sub> may be contributing to the identified differences in slope of activation change for the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group versus the HDBR group. CO<sub>2</sub> is a strong vasodilator and, among other effects, results in increased blood flow to the brain (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), as well as increased intensity of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal measured by fMRI (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Corfield et al., 2001</xref>). This increased cerebral perfusion could be contributing to the identified group differences here. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> selectively favors frontal lobe perfusion (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bhogal et al., 2015</xref>); thus increased slope of change for frontal regions (e.g., middle frontal gyrus) among the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group could be particularly related to perfusion effects on the BOLD signal. As brain deactivation is also an active process, the widespread <italic>increases in deactivation</italic> that we noted (which were generally associated with better behavioral performance) could also be influenced by CO<sub>2</sub>-related perfusion effects.</p>
                <p>It has been demonstrated that <italic>decreased</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> (through voluntary hyperventilation) negatively impacts postural sway, resulting in unsteadiness of balance (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sakellari et al., 1997</xref>). Although the mechanisms here are unknown, it has been suggested that hyperventilation disrupts vestibular system compensation, including interfering with central and peripheral somatosensory signals from the lower limbs (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sakellari et al., 1997</xref>). Here the differential effects between HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR subjects demonstrate that <italic>increased</italic> CO<sub>2</sub> may also disrupt normal vestibular processing and vestibular compensatory mechanisms.</p>

                <title>SANS vs. No-SANS Group Differences</title>
                <p>SANS subjects showed stronger correlations between pre- to post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> change in balance ratio score and brain changes. This suggests a relationship between SANS status and visual contributions to balance. Higher ratio scores are associated with more reliance on external visual cues for balance. As those with the greatest <italic>activation</italic> of regions such as middle frontal gyrus also showed the greatest pre- to post- <italic>increase</italic> in visual dependence, this could indicate reduced neural efficiency—in which these individuals are recruiting extra brain regions to aid in processing of the same vestibular information. This indicates reduced efficiency of the vestibular system that manifested behaviorally as greater reliance on the visual system during post-bed rest balance. These findings require validation in future studies to more clearly understand implications for the one third of astronauts who develop SANS (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>Limitations of the present work include the small pilot sample, lack of ambulatory control group, and differences in scanning timeline and parameters between the two groups. As the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR groups were each part of separate, larger bed rest campaigns, the respective testing timelines were restricted by NASA and not matched between groups. Further, only males were included in the HDBR group, as these participants were control subjects for a different investigator’s testosterone supplementation study. Although the vestibular stimulation parameters and sequence duration were identical between the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR groups, these data were collected on two different Siemens scanners with two slightly different fMRI sequences. The HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> fMRI sequence included a faster TR and more volumes (TR = 2.5 s; 96 volumes) than the HDBR sequence (TR = 3.66 s; 66 volumes). This amounts to greater statistical power for the HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> group. While these differences represent a limitation of the between-group comparisons that we report here, multisite neuroimaging studies are increasing in popularity; such studies generally indicate that functional neuroimaging data is robust across sites (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Costafreda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Biswal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gountouna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Noble et al., 2017</xref>). Further, the analyses in the present work focus on differences in within-subject brain changes. That is, we have tested for between-group differences in within-person intercepts and slopes of change in brain activity. This makes the present results more robust to any introduced variance due to scanner or sequence differences.</p>
                <p>Due to the limited pilot sample size, we use uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-values for the neuroimaging statistical tests to better detect within- and between-subject differences. Nonetheless, here we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of characterizing vestibular brain changes during multiple weeks of bed rest combined with elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. We present compelling preliminary findings based on these highly unique data, which should be validated in future work.</p>
                <p>It should also be noted that it is difficult to fully generalize these bed rest findings to spaceflight. HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> and HDBR mimic only some of the effects of spaceflight, such as body unloading, altered sensory input, and fluid shifts, but these analogs do not include all features of spaceflight that could impact vestibular processing. Finally, as is typical with the pneumatic skull tap method, the stimulus did not induce any vestibular perception, motion sensation, or movement in head position. Instead of using subjective perception of the vestibular stimulus, assessment of vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials in the eye muscles (oVEMPs) outside of the scanner was used to validate successful stimulation of vestibular organs.</p>

                <title>Applications to Spaceflight and Future Directions</title>
                <p>The present findings document changes in functional vestibular processing with spaceflight analog environments. These findings support that spaceflight factors do likely influence the neural correlates of vestibular processing; however, there is limited past work investigating vestibular processing in astronauts. Two previous studies suggest changes from pre- to post- spaceflight in resting-state (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Demertzi et al., 2016</xref>) and task-based connectivity (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Pechenkova et al., 2019</xref>) in brain networks that support vestibular function. Our past work has identified disrupted white matter structural connectivity in several tracts that underlie sensory integration and vestibular processes and associations of these brain changes with balance declines (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019b</xref>). For instance, we found that astronauts with the <italic>largest</italic> spaceflight-associated balance disruptions also had the <italic>greatest</italic> white matter declines in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019b</xref>), which connects the temporoparietal and prefrontal cortices and is thought to subserve vestibular functions (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Spena et al., 2006</xref>). However, no studies to date have tested spaceflight-related changes in functional brain activity during processing of vestibular information. To address this critical literature gap, an ongoing prospective study by our group is measuring brain activity with the pneumatic skull tap paradigm at two time points before and four time points after astronauts complete ISS missions. Comparing these results with the present work will help to elucidate how additional microgravity factors not induced by bed rest (e.g., an altered gravitational vector) might affect the neural correlates of vestibular processing.</p>

              <title>Conclusion</title>
              <p>Here we demonstrate the feasibility of assessing longitudinal neural vestibular changes following 30 days of HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. We identify support for specific effects of combined HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> on vestibular processing, adaptive plasticity of the vestibular system during HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> followed by fast and slow recovery, and relationships between adaptive plasticity and spared behavioral performance post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. We note some differences between neural processing of vestibular information for HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> versus HDBR subjects, as well as implications for dependence on visual cues during balance for SANs versus no-SANS subjects. Together, these findings contribute to understanding of how the vestibular system adapts to altered sensory inputs and to understanding of how spaceflight may influence the neural correlates of vestibular processing.</p>
