                <p id="Par1">Plants grown in spaceflight exhibited differential methylation responses and this is important because plants are sessile, they are constantly exposed to a variety of environmental pressures and respond to them in many ways. We previously showed that the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome exhibited lower methylation level after spaceflight for 60 h in orbit. Here, using the offspring of the seedlings grown in microgravity environment in the SJ-10 satellite for 11 days and returned to Earth, we systematically studied the potential effects of spaceflight on DNA methylation, transcriptome, and phenotype in the offspring. Whole-genome methylation analysis in the first generation of offspring (F<sub>1</sub>) showed that, although there was no significant difference in methylation level as had previously been observed in the parent plants, some residual imprints of DNA methylation differences were detected. Combined DNA methylation and RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that expression of many pathways, such as the abscisic acid-activated pathway, protein phosphorylation, and nitrate signaling pathway, etc. were enriched in the F<sub>1</sub> population. As some phenotypic differences still existed in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, it was suggested that these epigenetic DNA methylation modifications were partially retained, resulting in phenotypic differences in the offspring. Furthermore, some of the spaceflight-induced heritable differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were retained. Changes in epigenetic modifications caused by spaceflight affected the growth of two future seed generations. Altogether, our research is helpful in better understanding the adaptation mechanism of plants to the spaceflight environment.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Differences in epigenetic regulation of gene expression induced by environmental stress exposure can persist into the next generation of stressed plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In some cases, these intergenerational effects can even be passed down to at least two seed generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In plants, repeated exposure to stress triggers stress adaptation, in which previous stress increases the plant’s ability to respond to future stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This concept has been extended to many aspects of the formation of plant stress memories, in which the altered state of plant stress response is transmitted by mitosis or meiosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Stress memory in plants is of great interest, including its underlying molecular mechanisms and its potential effects on crop yields, especially in harsh environments. Stress also causes epigenetic changes in DNA methylation profiles and further genomic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Previous studies on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and Scots pine (<italic>Pinus silestris</italic>) growing near the Chernobyl reactor have shown that increased genome methylation level is related to genome stability and stress tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Molinier and colleagues reported that exposure to UVC increased the rate of somatic recombination in the plant progeny, whereas increases in UVC-induced homologous recombination frequency (HRF) continued for five generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par4">DNA methylation is considered to be a possible mechanism for the formation of stress memories in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. DNA methylation occurs in three sequence environments in plant genomes, namely mCpG, mCHG, and mCHH, where H is not G, and is thought to play a role in transposable element (TE) silencing and maintenance of genomic stability, and to contribute to gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This potential effect on gene expression suggests that DNA methylation may complement genetic variation and promote phenotypic variation as a means of transmitting genetic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In fact, the DNA methylation state can be faithfully maintained during mitosis or meiosis by a number of pathways and enzymes. During gametogenesis and spermatogenesis, parental DNA methylation patterns are reconstructed and reproduced, although it is not clear to what extent the patterns of DNA methylation in plant genomes are reprogrammed. Because these processes occur during growth from plant embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, any cumulative variation in DNA methylation (“epi-alleles”), whether environmentally induced or spontaneous, can persist for generations. DNA methylation shows stable genetic ability and the frequency of epi-alleles in the literature is similar to that of genetic polymorphisms due to spontaneous gene mutations, which may occur at a higher-than-normal frequency under conditions of abiotic stress.</p>
              <p id="Par5">This potential has led to many studies of epigenetic alleles, mediated by intergenerational stress memory, which may open up exciting possibilities for crop (epi-) genomics. However, an alteration in plant phenotype caused by a change in intergenerational methylation is still of a rare occurrence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Due to the lack of early reports on the inheritance of spaceflight effects on plants, in the current study, we systematically studied the potential effects of spaceflight on environmentally induced DNA methylation, using the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. With an experiment designed to minimize genetic variation, the ability of plants to create transgenerational stress memories over three successive generations was observed and combined with in-depth DNA methylation profiling and RNA-sequencing analysis. Subsequently, we also tested the possibility of microgravity-induced heritable alleles being associated with adaptive gene expression in spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par6">DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification that modifies gene expression and is passed down at least one generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Previous studies have demonstrated that significant differences in the modification of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) within the genome of plants undergoing spaceflight, compared with on-ground controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The main purpose of the study was to analyze the transgenerational memory induced by the spaceflight environment in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants. The experiment was part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences SJ-10 satellite mission and involved a follow-up experiment to the launch of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings which were flown in the SJ-10 recoverable satellite in April<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Detailed analysis of the growth and development phenotypes in three consecutive generations from the original spaceflight seedlings was carried out. To evaluate the dynamic DNA methylome alteration and the genetic effects on the offspring following spaceflight, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the F<sub>1</sub> generation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Systematic phenotypic observations, combined with genome-wide methylation analysis, revealed a plant adapting comprehensively to the stressful microgravity environment associated with spaceflight, from the perspective of epigenomic methylation level. We report here on how exposure of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings to the microgravity environment during spaceflight contributed to the intergenerational changes in plant development and stress response. Some of these changes continued for generations, even in the absence of subsequent stress, and we discuss here how these heritable changes may be due to changes in genomic methylation involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression.</p>

After 60 h culture, the total DNA was extracted for genome-wide methylation analysis from the G0 and S0 populations of the parent generation. After completion of the spaceflight (11 days), a representative sample of G0 and S0 seedlings was transplanted into soil on Earth to grow them to maturity to measure growth and development traits, and to collect self-fertilized seed from individual plants to breed the next generation (and subsequent generations). This seed production was continued for three more generations, and phenotype analysis was carried out on each generation.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of experimental procedures on board the SJ-10 recoverable satellite and follow-up experiments.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings on board the SJ-10 satellite in spaceflight and on the ground, and the follow-up experimental design arrangements. <italic>Arabidopsis seedlings</italic> were transferred from petri dishes 3 d before launching. Seedlings in culture chambers installed in growth chamber unit 1 were grown under microgravity conditions and fixed in space using RNAlater® as described in the previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The seedlings in the culture chamber installed in growth chamber unit two in the satellite grew for 11 days under microgravity; after this time of spaceflight, they were still alive, were returned to Earth, and cultivated until seed harvest. <bold>b</bold> Multiple independent lineages began with individual inbred <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, propagated by single-seed descent, with self-fertilization, for three generations, with half of the lineages exposed to the microgravity of space and the remainder maintained on Earth. Intergenerational stress memory tests were performed on the offspring plants. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and transcriptome analyses were performed on the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Various growth phenotypes were assessed in successive F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and F<sub>3</sub> generations.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="42003_2021_2342_Fig1_HTML" id="d32e419"/></fig></p>
                <p id="Par8">In the F<sub>1</sub> generation (G1 and S1 populations), DNA was extracted from 6-day-old seedlings of each population and used for genome-wide methylation analysis to detect changes in methylation levels, and to evaluate the genetic and phenotypic effects of DNA methylation at the whole-genome level. Transcriptome sequencing was also performed on the F<sub>1</sub> generation at the same time. Similar offspring studies were subsequently carried out on later generations of the ground control (G2–G3) and spaceflight groups (S2–S3), all carried out under strict and consistent growth conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p>

                <title>The progeny of spaceflight-stressed plants (S1) exhibited different phenotypes, compared with ground controls (G1)</title>
                <p id="Par9">It is known that heavy metal and nutrient deficiency stresses can cause plants to adapt to stress, and, in some cases, this adaptation can be passed on to the offspring of the stressed plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. To identify whether intergenerational alterations induced by exposure to microgravity during spaceflight were reflected in plant development and stress tolerance, we systematically compared the offspring of the spaceflight and the ground control populations. Individual spaceflight (S0) and ground control (G0) plants were individually self-fertilized to generate populations of S1 and G1 seeds, and, subsequently S2, S3 and G2, G3 populations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The plant growth parameters of the three generations of the two populations, which were assessed included leaf area, root length, flowering time, silique length, root gravitropism, and abscisic acid (ABA)-sensitivity analysis.</p>

              <p id="Par21">As sessile organisms, plants need to constantly adjust their responses to external stimuli in order to adapt to their environment. Due to the fact that seed dispersal is usually quite limited, offspring are likely to be affected by parental growth conditions. Since many environmental pressures last for several generations, other adaptation mechanisms may also exist. Epigenetic modification, which regulates gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, is an attractive alternative mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Epigenetic traits play a key role in controlling gene expression and subsequent responses to the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Learning more about plant DNA methylation changes during spaceflight will provide a basic understanding of how plants adapt to stress and, more specifically, to the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par22">Plants are affected by abiotic and biological environmental factors in many ways. In addition to changes in plant physiology and increased resistance/tolerance responses, genomic dynamics also change. For example, transposable elements are activated by abiotic and biotic stress conditions, mutations are induced by chemical agents, and homologous recombination is enhanced by stresses such as high temperature or UVB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, we know little about the evolutionary impact of these changes; because most of these changes occur in somatic tissues, they cannot be identified in future generations. In plants, germ cells are produced from somatic tissue late in development, so some of the genomic changes acquired during plant growth could be passed on to the next generation. In fact, the frequency of fixed gene mutations increases significantly in the offspring of UVB- or pathogen-exposed plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Genomic changes in the offspring of the stress group are expected to return to original levels. Similar to this general prediction, the reduction of methylation in the F<sub>1</sub> generation spaceflight samples (S1), compared to the control samples (G1), was obviously lower than that of the parental generation (S0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We show in the current study that the reduction in DNA methylation levels decreased over generations from the original parent plants exposed to the spaceflight environment. The phenotypes observed in successive F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>3</sub> generations are also consistent with this prediction.</p>
              <p id="Par23">Cross-generational effects in genetically uniform populations of plants and animals are usually associated with changes in genomic DNA methylation. This led us to compare the levels of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) in genomic DNA isolated from the offspring of stressed S0 and non-stressed control G0 plants. The observation of various growth and development phenotypes and stress sensitivity of the offspring plants, cultured under nonstress conditions, was analyzed. Compared with the offspring of the same-generation control plants, the 5-mC content was slightly downregulated in S1 plants grown from seed from plants exposed to spaceflight stress (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), indicating that DNA methylation tended to decrease when stress was not maintained.</p>
              <p id="Par24">In a more detailed study, we measured the overall genomic methylation by WGBS analysis. The different methylation levels between the F<sub>1</sub> generations of spaceflight and ground samples were compared. Compared with the ground control (G1), the regions with lower methylation levels in S1 were regarded as hypomethylated regions, with these genes being involved in signal transduction, transcription, protein metabolism, and stress response. The general concept of spaceflight-induced DNA methylation changes supports the overall conclusions obtained in an earlier study from ecotype Col-0 seedlings growing on spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; however, previous research by Zhou et al. (2019) did not observe wide-scale hypomethylation during spaceflight, in a study with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotype Ws-0, that was germinated and lived on the International Space Station, ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We speculate that the inconsistent results were mainly due to the ISS experiment and spaceflight experiment itself or the use of different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes. Recent transcriptome sequencing studies have shown that gene expression profiles and alternative gene splicing patterns in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ecotypes Col-0 and Ws-0 differed significantly in their adaptation to microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and these results suggest that the two ecotypes may have different genomic methylation patterns in response to the microgravity environment. Other possible reasons, such as the growth hardware, and the age of the seedlings on the spaceflight, may also play a role. This research experiment also highlights the importance of natural variation impacts when designing and interpreting changes related to the space microgravity environment. Of course, we should acknowledge the limitations of spaceflight experiments themselves. We cannot resolve gravity affects without performing a control grown on a centrifuge in space in the same hardware, and seedlings were only exposed to spaceflight for a short period of time, so it was not known how this translates to long-term growth of seedlings.</p>
              <p id="Par25">Similar to our result, previous research reported an increase in the plant root length in spaceflight and simulated microgravity (Random Positioning Machine, RPM) experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. They also found the red light was able to compensate for deleterious effects of microgravity on the root cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, cell cycle acceleration and changes in essential nuclear functions induced by simulated microgravity in a synchronized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cell culture were also observed; as well as some observations on changes in chromatin-based regulation increased chromatin condensation, and the overall depletion of nuclear transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It should be noted that this work shows that microgravity promotes genomic methylation levels, a conclusion that is inconsistent with our results. One reason, we speculate, is that spaceflight experiments and simulated microgravity experiments are different in themselves, or that the cultured cells and plant seedlings do not respond exactly the same way to microgravity stimulation. Another study showed that gravitational and magnetic field variations synergized to cause subtle variations in the global transcriptional state of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in vitro callus cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. These results expand our knowledge of how culture plant cells and plant seedlings are affected by microgravity.</p>
              <p id="Par26">Interestingly, we observed that root length, flowering time, and silique length were significantly increased in the spaceflight F<sub>1</sub> generation compared with the ground control F<sub>1</sub> offspring, but that only the root length phenotype was preserved in the F<sub>2</sub> generation (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Here, we also detected transcriptome changes in the F<sub>1</sub> generation plants, using RNA-Seq analysis, and we identified many gene expression changes between the S1 generation of spaceflight-stressed plants and the G1 ground control plants. Three independent repeat sequences were used to compare the transcriptome of S1 and G1. Expression of 206 genes was upregulated at the RNA level and that of 188 genes was downregulated, when using 2-fold changes and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 differences in expression as threshold criteria. This DEG group contained many genes involved in abiotic stress response and signaling. We identified spaceflight-associated hypomethylation of nitrate signaling genes <italic>TGA1</italic> and <italic>TGA4</italic> in the gene body region of the CpG context, which may contribute to the increased nitrogen absorption efficiency observed in the F<sub>1</sub> generation of spaceflight offspring (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b, c</xref>). Furthermore, the hypomethylation level of <italic>TGA1</italic> and <italic>TGA4</italic> inherited conserved methylation sites were also identified in the F<sub>2</sub> (S2) generation but not in the F<sub>3</sub> (S3) generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b, c</xref>). We inferred that the gene expression changes caused by microgravity-induced inherited modification of methylation sites could explain, at least partly, the increased growth phenotype in the spaceflight plant offspring.</p>
              <p id="Par27">In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, CpG methylation is mainly controlled by the methyltransferase, MET1, and the chromatin remodeling agent, decreased DNA methylation1 (DDM1). DNA methylation is also associated with genomic stability, especially with respect to transposable factors. We revealed here the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, which was involved in many types of abiotic stress genes previously associated with spaceflight responses, including stress response, cold response, cell wall remodeling, nitrate metabolism, plant hormone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, etc. In the offspring, we focused on the validation and analysis of ABA-responsive kinase signaling genes and nitrogen metabolism genes, the results showing that the spaceflight-induced genome methylation alterations, which were passed down to their offspring, contributed to the changes in gene expression level between the S and G samples, which result in the transgenerational adaptation by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to the spaceflight environment. At the same time, the spaceflight-induced DNA methylation difference between S0 and G0 tended to decrease between generations. All in all, our results are helpful in improving the strategies by which plants adapt to stress, and, more importantly, to the outer space environment.</p>

The g-profile during launch was as follows: the first-level maximum static overload was 4.8 g in flight for 150 s; the second-level maximum static overload was 6.0 g in flight for 180 s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

The ground controls were cultivated in a growth chamber, and grown for 11 days on Earth under the similar conditions as the spaceflight samples. It should be noted that the plant experimental unit is airtight, sealed on the ground and sent to the space. So the gas composition in the plant culture unit was the same as on-ground control.</p>
