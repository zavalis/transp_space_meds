                  <title>Question</title>
                  <p>Given that thrombosis and abnormal internal jugular venous flow have been documented in astronauts, does a retrograde extension of clot occur intracranially, and is abnormal dural venous sinus flow associated with spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)?</p>
                </sec>
                <sec id="ab-zoi210902-2">
                  <title>Findings</title>
                  <p>In this cohort study of 12 astronauts, there was no evidence of intracranial dural venous sinus thrombosis. Astronauts with SANS had significantly greater preflight to postflight increases in intracranial dural venous volumes than astronauts without SANS.</p>

                <sec id="ab-zoi210902-3">
                  <title>Meaning</title>
                  <p>The finding of an association between intracranial venous congestion and SANS suggests that aberrant venous flow may play a role in the development of SANS and astronauts with increased venous sinus compliance may be at increased risk.</p>

                <p>This cohort study clarifies the risk of internal jugular venous thrombosis among astronauts by evaluating the intracranial venous structures following spaceflight and assesses associations between intracranial venous congestion and spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS).</p>

                  <title>Importance</title>
                  <p>Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) occurs in 40% to 60% of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) International Space Station (ISS) astronauts who present postflight with ophthalmological findings and elevated intracranial pressure. The etiology of SANS is unknown; it is hypothesized that venous outflow congestion from the head and neck occurs because of microgravity, which is supported by the finding of internal jugular vein stagnant flow and thrombosis in some astronauts, but the impact on intracranial dural venous sinus structures remains unknown.</p>

                  <p>This retrospective cohort study of all NASA astronauts who had undergone magnetic resonance (MR) venography at the time of the study included quantitative and qualitative assessments of the intracranial venous system on preflight and postflight MR venograms. Data were collected a mean (SD) of 525.8 (187.5) days before spaceflight and 2.0 (1.5) days after return to Earth. A semiautomated segmentation of the venogram images was used, which was then compared with a neuroradiologistâs assessment.</p>

                  <p>These findings, in conjunction with the growing body of evidence of abnormal blood flow dynamics during spaceflight, suggest an association between intracranial venous congestion and SANS.

              <p>Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) occurs in approximately 40% to 60% of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) International Space Station (ISS) astronauts who present post flight with altered visual acuity, areas of injury to the retina, globe flattening, optic disk edema, and mildly elevated intracranial pressures (ICPs).<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The etiology of SANS is unknown, but a leading hypothesis is congestion of venous outflow from the head and neck because of microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shifts. This was supported by detection of stagnant flow by Doppler ultrasound<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and, in 2 cases, thrombosis in the internal jugular veins of ISS astronauts.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Considering the unknown risk of thrombus embolism and retrograde extension to the intracranial veins, a decision was made to provide anticoagulation treatment to the 1 astronaut who was diagnosed with thrombosis while aboard the ISS.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Treatment was carried out until 4 days prior to return to Earth.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The association of internal jugular vein stagnant flow and thrombosis with intracranial venous pressure as well as intracranial and intraocular pressure remains unknown.

                <p>At the time of data acquisition for this study, all NASA astronauts who had undergone MR venograms before and after ISS missions were included as participants in this study. While MRIs have been performed before and after spaceflight on all astronauts routinely, per NASA medical requirements since 2009, only recently has intracranial MR venography been included as part of the NASA medical operations protocol. Based on published guidelines,<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> astronauts who met the diagnostic criteria for SANS postflight were included in the SANS group, while the remainder were included in the non-SANS group.</p>

The study was approved by the institutional review boards at the NASA Johnson Space Center and the Medical University of South Carolina.

                <p>MRI was performed on a 3T Siemens Verio scanner and included an MR venogram and a volumetric T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient-echo sequence. MR venograms were performed using a flow sensitive technique without administration of intravenous contrast with the following parameters: 0.5âÃâ0.5âÃâ1.6 mm<sup>3</sup> voxels; repetition time, 21 milliseconds; echo time, 5.42 milliseconds; flip angle, 30Â°. The following parameters were used for the structural T1-weighted sequences: 0.9âÃâ0.5âÃâ0.45 mm<sup>3 </sup>voxels; repetition time, 1900 milliseconds; echo time, 2.32 milliseconds; flip angle, 9Â°.</p>
                <p>Venous structures (ie, superior sagittal sinus, left and right transverse/sigmoid sinuses) were segmented using a semiautomated pipeline, and preflight to postflight percentage changes in venous volumes were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi210902f1">Figure 1</xref>). The venograms were processed to enhance contrast before segmentation. The images were corrected for intensity in homogeneity artifact using the N4BiasFieldCorrection program from the Advanced Normalization Tools toolbox (version 2.3.4).<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Then, each astronautsâ structural images were aligned to their corresponding MR venograms at each corresponding preflight and postflight time using spm_coreg and spm_reslice<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> from the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 12 software suite. Once aligned, the structural images were subtracted from the venograms to provide a greater contrast between the tissue background and the bright sinuses, a feature not present in the structural images. Voxels in the difference images were then thresholded at 14% of maximum brightness, leaving only the sinus features.</p>

                <p>The sinus masks were divided in a similar manner into right transverse/sigmoid sinus, left transverse/sigmoid sinus, and superior sagittal sinus.

              <p>On Earth, venous outflow obstruction can result from blockage of the dominant transverse sinus by intraluminal structures, such as prominent arachnoid granulations, chronic thrombus, fenestrations, and congenital septations, which appear at MR venography as focal areas of dural venous sinus narrowing.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> At invasive manometry, pressure gradients of greater than 10 mm Hg can be present across these focal stenoses,<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and treatment with stent placement across the stenoses reduces the pressure gradient, normalizing ICP.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210902r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Another appearance in patients with IIH at MR venography is long-segment transverse sinus narrowing, thought to result from extrinsic compression of the transverse sinus in the setting of elevated ICP.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Therefore, on Earth, the level of venous outflow obstruction occurs within the cranium because of intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors. For NASA astronauts with SANS, instead of narrowing, we found enlargement of the dural venous sinuses, which suggests the level of obstruction is further downstream, outside the cranium. We hypothesize dural venous sinus congestion in SANS results from the lack of normal drainage, facilitated on Earth by gravity, through the internal jugular veins and vertebral venous plexuses, as was recently documented in some ISS astronauts.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p>
              <p>Unlike most veins, the dural venous sinuses are rigid structures that resist deformation despite large physiological variations in surrounding ICP.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210902r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> They are triangular in shape, formed from the tough periosteal and meningeal layers of dura, and are protected anatomically by attachment to the inner table of the skull.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Abnormal dural venous sinus compliance is considered by some to be a key factor in the development of IIH, as laxity of the dural venous sinus walls would allow narrowing at times of high ICP, thereby contributing further to venous outflow obstruction.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Here, distention of the walls of the dural venous sinuses in astronauts with SANS may reflect venous sinus laxity. Laxity may be a risk factor for the development of SANS, as dural venous sinus rigidity in astronauts without SANS may serve to resist the development of intracranial venous congestion.</p>
              <p>An alternative explanation for our findings may be that enlargement of the dural sinuses in astronauts with SANS occurs after return to Earth, prior to the postflight MRI. Imaging was performed in all of the astronauts within 5 days after landing, and we found no association with time to postflight imaging. However, compression of the venous system has been documented in patients with IIH, which resolves after cerebrospinal fluid diversion,<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and the possibility that a reduction in ICP from in-flight levels on return to Earth could have resulted in expansion of the intracranial venous system needs further study. As dural sinus pressure is always maintained below cerebrospinal fluid pressure, because of the waterfall effect occurring at the level of the bridging veins, enlargement of the dural sinuses may reflect an abrupt ICP normalization on return to a 1 gravity environment, with a rebound cerebrospinal fluid overdrainage.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="zoi210902r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Supporting this explanation, abrupt changes in ICP have been documented when alternating between microgravity and hypergravity during parabolic flight.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Arguing against this possibility is the moderately elevated opening pressures of as much as 28.5 cm of water documented post flight, months after return to Earth, in astronauts with SANS.<sup><xref rid="zoi210902r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Limitations</title>
                <p>This study has limitations, including the small number of astronauts and the lack of invasive ICP and intravenous pressure correlation. These data would be helpful in determining the physiological significance of the change in dural venous sinus volumes that we document here. An additional limitation is the lack of data concerning any potential SANS countermeasure usage among the astronaut cohort.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Our study, in conjunction with the growing body of evidence of abnormal blood flow dynamics with venous outflow stagnation during spaceflight, suggests an association between intracranial venous congestion and SANS. The implication thus exists that individuals with increased venous sinus compliance may be at increased risk of developing SANS. These findings should be confirmed in a larger astronaut population. These results underscore the need for further studies to determine whether changes in the venous sinus volumes documented here are clinically relevant and whether venous congestion contributes to the development of SANS or headaches among astronauts. Additionally, these results may provide insight into terrestrial disorders of intracranial venous congestion and cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis.</p>
