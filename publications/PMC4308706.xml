              <abstract>
                <p>L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (LTCCs), particularly Cav1.2 LTCCs, play fundamental roles in cellular responses to mechanical stimuli in osteoblasts. Numerous studies have shown that mechanical loading promotes bone formation, whereas the removal of this stimulus under microgravity conditions results in a reduction in bone mass. However, whether microgravity exerts an influence on LTCCs in osteoblasts and whether this influence is a possible mechanism underlying the observed bone loss remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that simulated microgravity substantially inhibited LTCC currents and suppressed Cav1.2 at the protein level in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells. In addition, reduced Cav1.2 protein levels decreased LTCC currents in MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, simulated microgravity increased miR-103 expression. Cav1.2 expression and LTCC current densities both significantly increased in cells that were transfected with a miR-103 inhibitor under mechanical unloading conditions. These results suggest that simulated microgravity substantially inhibits LTCC currents in osteoblasts by suppressing Cav1.2 expression. Furthermore, the down-regulation of Cav1.2 expression and the inhibition of LTCCs caused by mechanical unloading in osteoblasts are partially due to miR-103 up-regulation. Our study provides a novel mechanism for microgravity-induced detrimental effects on osteoblasts, offering a new avenue to further investigate the bone loss induced by microgravity.</p>

          <body>
            <p>The maintenance of bone mass and the development of skeletal architecture are dependent on mechanical stimulation. Numerous studies have shown that mechanical loading promotes bone formation in the skeleton, whereas the removal of this stimulus during immobilization or in microgravity results in reduced bone mass. Microgravity, which is the condition of weightlessness that is experienced by astronauts during spaceflight, causes severe physiological alterations in the human body. One of the most prominent physiological alterations is bone loss, which leads to an increased fracture risk. Long-term exposure to a microgravity environment leads to enhanced bone resorption and reduced bone formation over the period of weightlessness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. An approximately 2% decrease in bone mineral density after only one month, which is equal to the loss experienced by a postmenopausal woman over one year, occurs in severe forms of microgravity-induced bone loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Experimental studies have shown that real or simulated microgravity can induce skeletal changes that are characterized by cancellous osteopenia in weight-bearing bones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>, decreased cortical and cancellous bone formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, altered mineralization patterns<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, disorganized collagen and non-collagenous proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, and decreased bone matrix gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Decreased osteoblast function has been thought to play a pivotal role in the process of microgravity-induced bone loss. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have provided evidence of decreased matrix formation and maturation when osteoblasts are subjected to simulated microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The mechanism by which microgravity, which is a form of mechanical unloading, has detrimental effects on osteoblast functions remains unclear and merits further research.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, conducting well-controlled in vitro studies in sufficient numbers under real microgravity conditions is difficult and impractical because of the limited and expensive nature of spaceflight missions. Thus several ground-based systems, particularly clinostats, have been developed to simulate microgravity using cultured cells to investigate pathophysiology during spaceflight. A clinostat simulates microgravity by continuously moving the gravity vector before the cell has sufficient time to sense the gravity vector, therefore, sensing no weight would have effects on cells similar to those of weightlessness. This method is called gravity-vector averaging<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
            <p>Calcium is an important osteoblast regulator, and calcium channels are clearly associated with the regulation of osteoblast functions. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs), particularly LTCCs that selectively allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cross the plasma membrane, are key regulators of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in osteoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. LTCCs are composed of the pore-forming Î±<sub>1</sub> subunit and the auxiliary Î±<sub>2</sub>Î´ and Î² subunits; LTCCs in osteoblasts are devoid of the Î³ subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The Î±<sub>1</sub> subunit determines the fundamental properties of individual VSCCs and has four homologous domains, IâIV, each with six transmembrane segments that are linked by cytoplasmic loops with intracellular NH<sub>2</sub> and COOH termini<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Among the 10 known Î±<sub>1</sub> subunits, the L-type Cav1.2 Î±<sub>1C</sub> subunit is the most abundant and is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into growing osteoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>.</p>
            <p>LTCCs, particularly Cav1.2 LTCCs, play fundamental roles in cellular responses to external stimuli, including mechanical forces and hormonal signals, in osteoblastic lineage bone cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Several lines of evidence have found that bone density increases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and that bone resorption decreases when these calcium channels are activated in osteoblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The application of cyclic strain to the substratum results in the increased incorporation of calcium in Ros 17/2.8 cell cultures, and this response is diminished in the presence of verapamil, which is a blocker of LTCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. The administration of the LTCC antagonists verapamil and nifedipine can substantially suppress mechanical loading-induced increases in bone formation in rats, suggesting that LTCCs mediate mechanically induced bone adaptation in vivo<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The levels of the extracellular matrix proteins osteopontin and osteocalcin increased in periosteal-derived osteoblasts by applying strain alone or strain in the presence of the LTCC agonist Bay K8644 within 24âh post-load. This mechanically induced increase in osteopontin and osteocalcin was inhibited by nifedipine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In addition, physiological hormones such as parathyroid hormone and activated vitamin D<sub>3</sub> also modulate bone calcium homeostasis via LTCCs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Thus, LTCCs play important roles in regulating osteoblast function.</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that many factors participate in LTCC regulation. MicroRNA (miRNA), which is a small non-coding RNA molecule, has become the subject of many studies and functions in the silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. miRNAs function via base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Thus, these mRNA molecules are silenced by one or more of the following processes: the cleavage of the mRNA strand into two pieces, the destabilization of the mRNA through the shortening of its poly (A) tail, and decreased translation efficiency of the mRNA into proteins by ribosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. miR-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, miR-137<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, miR-328<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, miR-155<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, miR-145<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and miR-103<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> participate in regulating Cav1.2 expression in several types of cells, whereas their functions in osteoblasts have not been confirmed.</p>
            <p>Taken together, these data suggest that LTCCs have an important role in osteoblast function and that LTCCs are highly sensitive to mechanical stimulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. In addition, LTCCs in osteoblasts may be regulated by miRNAs. However, to our knowledge, whether microgravity exerts an influence on LTCCs in osteoblasts and the possible mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that simulated microgravity inhibits LTCCs in osteoblasts using patch-clamp analyses of whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells under simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. In addition, we used quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) and specific immunostaining approaches to examine the effects of simulated microgravity on Cav1.2 subunit expression. Moreover, we assessed the role of miR-103 in mediating the expression of the Cav1.2 subunit and the properties of LTCCs in osteoblasts.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity attenuates the Bay K8644-induced increase in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>)</title>
                <p>We performed calcium imaging to test for changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by Bay K8644 to determine whether simulated microgravity can affect LTCCs in MC3T3-E1 cells. The fluorescence intensity increased substantially within one second after the application of 10âÎ¼M Bay K8644 to the culture solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a and 1b</xref>). However, the effect of Bay K8644 on intracellular calcium dramatically decreased when the cells were pretreated with simulated microgravity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1c and 1d</xref>). The change in the fluorescence intensity ratio (R = [(F<sub>max</sub> â F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>] Ã 100%) of the control group was 2.48 Â± 0.52, and the ratio of the simulated microgravity group was 1.57 Â± 0.23. The difference between the ratios of the two groups is statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1e</xref>). In addition, 75.3% Â± 9.7% of the cells under simulated microgravity conditions and 80.7% Â± 4.6% of the cells in the control group responded to Bay K8644 when the cells were screened for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1f</xref>. The difference in the percentage of cells responding to Bay K8644 between the two groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity reduces LTCC currents in osteoblasts</title>
                <p>Electrophysiological recordings were performed on trypsinized cells to further confirm the influence of simulated microgravity on LTCCs in MC3T3-E1 cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates typical whole-cell LTCC currents recorded from osteoblasts from the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a</xref>) and simulated microgravity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2b</xref>) groups. The results show a reduction in LTCC currents due to simulated microgravity in the absence or presence of Bay K8644. The peak inward current was recorded at +10âmV for both control and simulated microgravity cells. The application of 10âÎ¼M Bay K8644 caused the current amplitude to increase by approximately 2-fold and to activate more steeply and at more negative potentials, whereas the application of 1âÎ¼M nifedipine suppressed the inward currents almost completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2a and 2b</xref>). These properties suggest that the recorded inward currents were Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents through LTCCs.</p>
                <p>Because cell size may affect the current amplitude, the currents were normalized for membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) as an indirect measurement of cell size and were expressed in picoampere (pA) per picofarad (pF). The inward currents were smaller at all command potentials in simulated microgravity compared with the control group regardless of whether the LTCCs were activated by Bay K8644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2c and 2d</xref>. The IâV relation, which was expressed in terms of current density, was calculated using the estimated C<sub>m</sub>). The LTCC current densities of the MC3T3-E1 cells of the simulated microgravity group were considerably smaller compared with those of the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2e</xref>). The mean peak current densities at +10âmV in the simulated microgravity and control groups were â2.41 Â± 0.38 and â3.52 Â± 0.48âpA/pF, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2e</xref>). The application of 10âÎ¼M Bay K8644 caused the maximum inward current density to increase by 1.5-fold, with no change in the maximal activation voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2f</xref>). The mean peak current densities in cells of the simulated microgravity and control groups were â3.24 Â± 0.32 and â5.43 Â± 0.49âpA/pF, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2f</xref>), in the presence of Bay K8644, indicating an approximately 2-fold decrease in sensitivity to Bay K8644 in the simulated microgravity group compared with the control.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity down-regulates Cav1.2 but up-regulates its transcript level</title>
                <p>The alteration of LTCC current and activity involves several significant components. The L-type Cav1.2 subunit is known to play a central role in the regulation of both LTCC current and activity; however, the roles of Cav1.2 in mediating the function of LTCCs under real or simulated microgravity conditions remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether Cav1.2 expression was altered under simulated microgravity conditions. We performed immunostaining for the Cav1.2 subunit in MC3T3-E1 cells to study the expression and cellular localization of Cav1.2 in cells under simulated microgravity conditions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, immunostaining for the Cav1.2 subunit in MC3T3-E1 cells is shown before and after exposure to 48âh of simulated microgravity conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Control cells stained for Cav1.2 showed abundant plasma membrane and intracellular localization, particularly on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3b and 3c</xref>). In contrast, the 48âh simulated microgravity conditions decreased immunostaining for Cav1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3f and 3g</xref>). Intracellular staining persisted but was less intense than that observed in control cells, and the staining for Cav1.2 in the cell periphery markedly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3f and 3g</xref>). Images were compared with cells that had been incubated with Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody in the absence of primary antibody to determine the specificity of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3d</xref>). The signal specificity for the antibody was determined by incubating MC3T3-E1 cells with competing peptide and anti-Cav1.2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3h</xref>). Western blot analyses were performed to further confirm the results of immunostaining for the Cav1.2 subunit in MC3T3-E1 cells regarding protein expression. Cav1.2 expression in the two groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>. Cav1.2 expression significantly decreased by approximately 50% under simulated microgravity conditions compared with that of the horizontal rotation controls (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p>
                <p>Cav1.2 mRNA expression was measured by QPCR in MC3T3-E1 cells treated for 48âh under simulated microgravity or control conditions. The QPCR results for the LTCCs expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells were normalized to untreated control values for each primer set to detect changes in expression levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref>, Cav1.2 mRNA subunit transcription levels increased by 1.4-fold under 48âh of simulated microgravity conditions compared with that of control (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). These data are in disagreement with the protein data, suggesting that certain mechanisms at the post-transcriptional level may play a role in regulating Cav1.2 expression.</p>

                <p>We examined LTCC currents by knocking down Cav1.2 expression to further clarify whether the alterations in Cav1.2 expression are involved in the reduction of LTCC currents in osteoblasts. Western blotting was used to evaluate gene knockdown efficiency following siRNA transfection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5a</xref>, siRNA treatment resulted in an approximately 60% suppression of the protein at 48âh post-transfection, with significant suppression lasting up to 72âh (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, the cells were subjected to patch clamp at 48âh post-transfection, which is the period at which Cav1.2 expression was maximally suppressed. LTCC current densities were significantly lower at all command potentials between cells receiving scrambled or Cav1.2 siRNA, regardless of whether the LTCCs were activated by Bay K8644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5b and 5c</xref>). The difference in the mean peak current densities at +10âmV between the Cav1.2 knockdown (â1.58 Â± 0.26âpA/pF) and the control cells (â2.76 Â± 0.34âpA/pF) was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5d</xref>).

                <p>Next, the influence of miR-103 on LTCC currents was investigated to further assess the role of miR-103 on the expression of Cav1.2. Under normal gravity conditions, the inward currents did not differ between the negative control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8a</xref>) and the miR-103 inhibitor group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8b</xref>). However, the inward currents were larger at all command potentials in the miR-103 inhibitor group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8d</xref>) compared with the negative control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8c</xref>) under simulated microgravity conditions in the absence or presence of Bay K8644.

              <p>Although the catabolic effects of microgravity on bone have been well documented, the mechanism by which mechanical unloading results in osteoblast dysfunction remains unclear. We have postulated that simulated microgravity has adverse effects on osteoblasts by inhibiting LTCCs. Our results indicate that simulated microgravity substantially inhibits LTCCs in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells by suppressing Cav1.2 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the up-regulation of miR-103 that is induced by simulated microgravity is involved in the down-regulation of Cav1.2 expression and in the inhibition of LTCCs in MC3T3-E1 cells.</p>
              <p>Orbital spaceflight has clearly demonstrated that the absence or the reduction of gravity has significant detrimental effects on astronauts. Health hazards in astronauts are represented by cardiovascular deconditioning and bone loss. Skeletal deconditioning, such as reduced bone mass, altered mineralization patterns and decreased bone matrix gene expression, has been described in astronauts and in rat models of simulated microgravity. The skeletal system impairment that is induced by mechanical unloading, which is one of the main limitations of long-term spaceflight, has received general attention by researchers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. LTCCs are involved in the production and release of paracrine/autocrine factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> and in changes in gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> in response to mechanical stimulation. Li et al. reported that LTCC inhibition significantly attenuates the bone formation that is associated with mechanical loading in rats and mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. These findings suggest that LTCCs play important roles in the regulation of osteoblast function and bone metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on LTCC currents in cultured MC3T3-E1 cells using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. By measuring inward currents, we found that simulated microgravity significantly reduced LTCC currents. This finding was also confirmed by calcium imaging, which showed that simulated microgravity significantly reduced Bay K8644-induced intracellular calcium increases. These observations are consistent with previous studies. Numerous bone anabolic regulatory factors, including parathyroid hormone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>, vitamin D<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, and mechanical stimuli<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, are able to activate and enhance LTCC currents. Therefore, microgravity, which is a form of mechanical unloading, may reduce LTCC currents in osteoblasts.</p>
              <p>Many factors can regulate LTCCs. The major LTCC subunit in osteoblasts is Cav1.2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Recent studies have shown that amyloid precursor protein (APP) inhibits LTCCs by down-regulating Cav1.2 expression in GABAergic inhibitory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Ronkainen et al. reported that LTCC currents in cardiomyocytes are suppressed by calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) through the down-regulation of Cav1.2 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Considering the inhibition of LTCC currents in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity condition, we investigated Cav1.2 expression in these cells. Our findings showed that simulated microgravity markedly suppresses the expression of Cav1.2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Then, we examined these currents following the knockdown of Cav1.2 expression to confirm that the reduction of Cav1.2 was involved in the alteration of LTCC currents in MC3T3-E1 cells. Our results demonstrated that the down-regulation of Cav1.2 expression notably reduces LTCC currents in MC3T3-E1 cells. These data suggested that the decreased activity of LTCCs in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity condition could be attributed to a decreased amount of Cav1.2 channel proteins.</p>
              <p>In addition to the APP and CaMKII studies mentioned above, other reports have investigating the regulation of the Cav1.2 channel protein. For example, selenium deficiency increases oxidative stress levels in the mouse myocardium, which is positively related to the up-regulation of Cav1.2 genes and proteins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Wang et al. demonstrated that Cav1.2 mRNA and protein levels increase in ROS cells following a 24-h incubation with a permeable analog of cAMP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. These experiments suggested that changes in Cav1.2 expression that are induced by different factors coincide with altered Cav1.2 mRNA expression. However, our findings indicated that increased Cav1.2 mRNA expression is not consistent with decreased Cav1.2 protein expression in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Therefore, this result suggested that a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation might participate in regulating Cav1.2 protein expression.</p>
              <p>miRNA, which is a small non-coding RNA molecule, has roles in RNA silencing and post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. Recently, six miRNAs have been linked to the regulation of Cav1.2 expression under different experimental conditions using a luciferase-based reporter assay. <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, which encodes a LTCC Cav1.2 subunit, is the gene target of miR-137 during the regulation of adult neurogenesis and neuron maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Other studies have shown that miR-1 is associated with heart defects and atrioventricular block through mediating Cav1.2 expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Lu et al. reported that miR-328 contributes to the adverse atrial electric remodeling in atrial fibrillation through targeting the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel genes <italic>Cacna1c</italic> and <italic>Cacnb1</italic>, which encode for Î±<sub>1c</sub> and Î²<sub>1</sub> subunits, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Moreover, miR-155<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, miR-145<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, and miR-103<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> have also been reported to play a crucial role in regulating Cav1.2 expression. We examined all six of these miRNAs by real-time PCR to determine which may be relevant to the altered Cav1.2 expression in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Our results showed that simulated microgravity increases miR-103 expression but has no effects on the other miRNAs. This finding indicated that miR-103 might be involved in regulating Cav1.2 expression under simulated microgravity conditions.</p>
              <p>We studied the effects of treating MC3T3-E1 cells with a miR-103 inhibitor to further determine the role of miR-103 in regulating Cav1.2 expression under simulated microgravity conditions. Our data showed that miR-103 inhibition remarkably increased the expression of Cav1.2 subunits and LTCC currents in MC3T3-E1 cells under simulated microgravity conditions; however, this treatment could not completely counteract the decreases in Cav1.2 expression and LTCC currents that were induced by simulated microgravity. These results are consistent with the finding by Favereaux et al., who demonstrated that the knockdown or overexpression of miR-103 up- or down-regulates, respectively, the level of Cav1.2 expression in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. miRNA functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via base-pairing with mRNA molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. miRNA silences mRNA by one or more of the following processes: the cleavage of the mRNA strand into two pieces, the destabilization of the mRNA through the shortening of its poly (A) tail, and reduced translation efficiency of the mRNA into proteins by ribosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In this study, simulated microgravity down-regulated Cav1.2 expression but up-regulated its transcript level, suggesting that miR-103 decreases Cav1.2 subunit expression by blocking the translation of the mRNA into protein. Collectively, these studies suggest that the up-regulation of miR-103 in simulated microgravity is at least partially involved in the regulation of Cav1.2 subunit expression and LTCC currents in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition to the miRNAs mentioned, there have been other reports investigating Cav1.2 expression at post-transcriptional level. Recent studies have shown that Cav1.2 contain an endoplasmic reticulum retention motif in the proximal C-terminal region, and the CavÎ² subunit has a role in regulating proteasomal degradation of this subunit<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Moreover, Rougier et al. showed that Nedd4-1 promotes the sorting of newly synthesized Cav1.2 for degradation by both the proteasome and the lysosome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. However, whether ubiquitination pathway or other possible mechanisms for regulating Cav1.2 expression at post-transcriptional level in osteoblasts under microgravity condition remain to be investigated.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, simulated microgravity inhibits LTCCs in MC3T3-E1 cells via the suppression of Cav1.2 expression. Moreover, the down-regulation of Cav1.2 expression and the inhibition of LTCCs are partially related to the up-regulation of miR-103 induced by simulated microgravity. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the relation between the inhibition of LTCCs and the up-regulation of miR-103 under conditions of simulated microgravity in MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro. This work may provide a novel mechanism of microgravity-induced adverse effects on osteoblasts, offering a new avenue to further investigate microgravity-induced bone loss. A more detailed analysis of the mechanisms accounting for the suppressive effect of simulated microgravity on Cav1.2 expression is under investigation.</p>

Cell membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) and access resistance (R<sub>a</sub>) were estimated from the capacitive current transient evoked by applying a 20âmV pulse for 40âms from a holding potential of â60âmV to â40âmV.</p>
                <p>The cell was held at â40âmV and then stepped in 10âmV increments from â30 to 60âmV. Voltage steps were 250âms in duration, and 2âs intervals were allowed between steps. Nonspecific membrane leakage and residual capacitive currents were subtracted using the p/4 protocol. Ba<sup>2+</sup> replaced Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier to increase unitary currents, and the divalent cation concentration was elevated in the bath solution. Barium was used as a current carrier for two reasons: barium current through L-type channels is known to be larger than calcium currents; and barium inhibits potassium channel activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Two types of external solutions, solutions A and B, were used. Solution A was used while making a gigaohm seal between the recording pipette and cell surface. This solution contained (in mM) 120 NaCl, 30 mannitol, 3 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 30 HEPES and was supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% glucose, with the pH corrected to 7.4 with NaOH. After a seal of 2âGÎ© was obtained, the perfusion fluid was changed to solution B during current recording. Solution B contained (in mM) 108 BaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, with the pH corrected to 7.6 with Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Cs<sup>+</sup> was used in the pipette solution to minimize outward K<sup>+</sup> current. The pipette solution contained (in mM) 150 CsCl, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 D-glucose, with the pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.</p>
