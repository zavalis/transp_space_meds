                <p id="Par1">Microgravity affects plant growth and content. A three-dimensional clinostat was used at 4 rotations/min to rotate the seeds of <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> cultivar (Ammon) in three dimensions for 7 days, following which the antioxidant activities of ethanolic extracts were evaluated using both nitric oxide- and hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activities. The antidiabetic activities of ethanolic extracts were evaluated by measuring the concentration of plasma glucose, insulin, C peptide, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); determining the number of β cells in the pancreatic islets; and performing the glucose tolerance test. Furthermore, the effects of the ethanolic extracts on the lipid profile and liver function were estimated. After rats were sacrificed, their pancreases were isolated and used for histopathological processing. The results indicated that the antioxidant potential and antioxidant metabolite content were significantly increased under microgravity conditions in comparison to those under normal gravity conditions. Rats treated with an extract of wheatgrass (<italic>T. aestivum</italic>) germinated over a period of 6–10 days under microgravity (WGM) showed a significant reduction in the levels of serum glucose, HbA1C, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and insulin resistance compared to rats treated with an extract of wheatgrass germinated under gravity. Additionally, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased. In contrast, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-peptide, and insulin levels rose significantly after treatment with <italic>T. aestivum</italic> germinated under microgravity. WGM is a promising potential diabetic treatment without side effects with a low manufacturing cost.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Diabetes is a metabolic syndrome that arises mainly due to deficiencies in insulin activity, insulin secretion, or both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> This disorder can cause serious problems that affect human health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Over the long term, uncontrolled diabetes can lead to several chronic complications, including renal failure, heart disease, and blindness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Statistically, 8.8% of the world’s population in 2015 exhibited the symptoms of this disease, and this percentage is predicted to rise to more than 10.4% by 2040.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par3">Despite the significant developments made in the management of diabetes over the past two decades, the effects of diabetes treatments in patients are still far from exemplary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> These treatments have many disadvantages, including a reduction in drug efficiency, toxicity, and side effects. For example, sulfonylureas lose their efficiency after 6 years of treatment in 44% of patients. It is also believed that glucose-lowering medications are not capable of controlling hyperlipidemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Recently, the use of herbal medications with insignificant toxicity and no side effects for the treatment of diabetes mellitus has been demonstrated to be of global importance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par4">Wheatgrass is believed to have a better nutritive value than nongerminated grains and their products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Antioxidant compounds, such as vitamins C, flavonoids, and phenolic compounds, are scarcely measurable in dry grains. However, upon germination, the concentrations of these antioxidant compounds increase with increasing germination time and peak after 7 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par5">There are numerous hypoglycemic medications available in the clinic, but these medications are associated with many side effects. Therefore, the current focus on diabetes treatment is on the development of an alternative solution for the treatment of diabetes from natural sources, which are affordable and effective and have fewer side effects than synthetic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> In traditional medicine, medicinal plants are used for the treatment of diabetes; these plants are a rich source of hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, and antioxidant agents, such as phenols, flavonoids, gallotannins, and other related polyphenols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par6">Wheatgrass (<italic>T. aestivum</italic> germinated over a period of 6–10 days) was found to improve metabolic and lipid profiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and to restore the levels of plasma glucose, insulin, and liver glycogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par7">The nutrient value of germinated grains depends on the conditions in which they are grown. These conditions include humidity, temperature, length of germination, culture medium, and steeping protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> The microgravity environment encountered during space flight has long been thought to affect plant growth and content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Until now, no research on the therapeutic potential of wheatgrass germinated under microgravity (WGM) conditions has been carried out. Therefore, the present study was carried out to produce wheatgrass with high antioxidant and antidiabetic potential, but no side effects with a low manufacturing cost.</p>

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disorder initiated by progressive damage to insulin-secreting β cells. STZ is normally used to induce diabetes in pancreatic rats by DNA alkylation and β cell fragmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> STZ selectively devastates the β cells, which secrete insulin, decreasing the β cell efficiency and resulting in diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Many living β cells remain after treatment with low-dose STZ, and their regeneration is also possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par32">In our study, significantly more β cells were observed in the group treated with the ethanol extract of WGM conditions, and stimulation due to insulin secretion could be responsible for most of the observed metabolic effects. Bioactive compounds in medicinal plants may have insulin-like properties and have been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, improve glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and activate the regeneration of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Currently, the only option for achieving normal glucose levels in diabetic patients is the stimulation of insulin secretion by medicinal plants or renewal of β cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Increased free radical generation and oxidative stress together with hyperglycemia play a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its late complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> β Cells are highly sensitive to destruction by oxidative stress because of their low level of free radical-scavenging enzymes, which protect the cell from the damaging effects of oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Decreased oxidative stress due to a reduced hyperglycemic status in diabetic conditions was detected in experimental animals following the administration of antioxidant compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par33">Although wheatgrass germinated under normal conditions (under gravity) showed significant antioxidant potential and antihyperglycemic effects in STZ-induced diabetic rats as a result of its high TP and flavonoid concentrations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> our results under microgravity conditions show even more promise in the field. The microgravity environment created by a three-dimensional (3D) clinostat produced wheatgrass with a higher concentration of antioxidant compounds and a higher potential for antioxidant activity than WGG. We hypothesize that the presence of a high concentration of some bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and vitamin C, in WGM conditions produces an insulinotropic effect due to the antidiabetic effects of these compounds that facilitates a decrease in blood glucose levels. The elevated plasma glucose levels in diabetic rats were decreased due to the administration of wheatgrass germinated extract under microgravity conditions, and the administration of WGM elevated C-peptide and plasma insulin levels compared to those in diabetic control rats. The possible mechanism of action of WGM conditions is its regeneration and stimulation of β cells to release insulin, which mediates a decrease in glucose levels, as shown in our results.</p>
              <p id="Par34">Wheatgrass ethyl alcohol extract was shown to decrease mononuclear cell infiltration in the β cells of the pancreas compared to that in the untreated group. This effect coincides with the protective effect of wheatgrass extract on the diabetes parameters investigated in this study. This effect was reported using germinated <italic>T. aestivum</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par35">The induction of diabetes by STZ led to a reduction in body weight due to structural protein degradation as a result of disturbances in carbohydrate metabolism and thus energy metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Due to damage to β cells caused by STZ, a decrease in body weight and an increase in water and food intake are commonly detected in diabetes, and these effects may be caused by metabolic changes due to the absence or deficiency of insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> The nonsignificant changes in the body weights of diabetic rats treated with extracts of WGG and WGM conditions as well as metformin-treated diabetic rats compared to the control group revealed the effect of a normal blood glucose level, which in turn prevents the loss of body weight.</p>
              <p id="Par36">HbA1c is used as an indicator to assess the degree of hemoglobin glycation in diabetes mellitus. HbA1c was found to represent the average fasting blood glucose level of diabetic patients over the previous 120 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Under diabetic conditions, extra glucose in the blood is covalently bound to hemoglobin to form HbA1c.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Hence, HbA1c levels are increased in untreated diabetic rats. Treatment with WGM conditions significantly reduced HbA1c levels in comparison to those in the gravity and diabetic control groups.</p>
              <p id="Par37">The liver plays a central role in the metabolism, storage, excretion, and detoxification of xenobiotics and their metabolites, and AST and ALT are effective markers of liver function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and STZ-induced diabetic liver injury in rats. For that reason, elevated activities of SGOT and SGPT in the plasma might be due mostly to the escape of these enzymes from the liver cell cytosol into the bloodstream, which is a signal of the hepatotoxic effect of STZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> Treatment of the diabetic rats with the extract of WGM conditions reduced the activities of these enzymes in plasma compared to those in the gravity and diabetic control groups and consequently alleviated liver damage caused by STZ-induced diabetes, as presented in our results.</p>
              <p id="Par38">However, insulin deficiency deactivates the lipoprotein lipase enzyme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> Under conditions of insulin deficiency with low lipoprotein lipase, TG, cholesterol, and LDL levels were elevated, and the HDL level was decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> This hypertriglyceridemia was reduced rapidly after insulin treatment therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In this study, the administration of WGM conditions significantly increased serum insulin levels, a marked decrease in TC, TG, and LDL levels in rats treated with WGM conditions and metformin-treated rats was observed in comparison to the diabetic control group. Additionally, an increased HDL level was observed compared to diabetic control rats. This activity of WGM conditions reduces hypertriglyceridemia under diabetic conditions and therefore prevents diabetic-associated complications.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Elevated plasma urea and creatinine levels signal the development of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> The urea and creatinine levels in rats with diabetic nephropathy are higher than those in normal rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> The observed maintenance of urea and creatinine levels closer to those in control rats using extracts of WGM and gravity conditions, as well as metformin treatment, suggests that germinated wheatgrass extract plays an either direct or indirect primary role in protecting against diabetic nephropathy or retarding its development.</p>
              <p id="Par40">An ethyl alcohol extract was selected because of the expected presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds with antihyperglycemic properties. The presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in our extract with antioxidant potential, as seen in our results, further confirms this prediction. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds were shown to have antihyperglycemic effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Phytochemical analysis of germinated wheatgrass showed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and sterols. Their antidiabetic effects and ability to regenerate pancreatic β cells have already been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Sterols were shown to decrease blood sugar levels in experimental animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> The antioxidant activity of these phenolic and flavonoid compounds depends on their redox properties, and these compounds can act as hydrogen donors, reducing agents, and singlet oxygen quenchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Polyphenolics containing hydroxyl groups are essential plant ingredients that can defend the body against oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> The present study concluded that the microgravity environment created by a 3D clinostat produced germinated <italic>T. aestivum</italic> with a high concentration of antioxidant compounds and high level of potential antioxidant activity; the produced wheatgrass has potential as a diabetic treatment without any side effects and a low manufacturing cost. This method can be used to explore the therapeutic potential of WGM conditions for other diseases.</p>

                <p id="Par41">Earth’s gravitational field at its surface at a certain location is a fixed vector pointing downwards (towards the Earth’s center) whose average magnitude is 9.8 m/s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> Many plants and organisms contain cells that sense gravity through sedimentation due to gravity. A procedure in which cells in plants or organisms are placed in a randomizing machine in which the gravity vector loses its effect on these cells would simulate the conditions of weightlessness in outer space as the direction of the gravity vector would be lost. The rotational speed of such a machine is determined by the time scale of the movement of the cells inside the plant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> There are many such machines, and the one used in this study was a 3D clinostat. We aimed to optimize a 3D clinostat for a life science experiment. Since a 3D clinostat is prepared with two motors, we fixed the angular velocity of one (primary) motor and varied for the angular velocity of the other (secondary) motor. In this setup, each motor ran continuously and constantly in one direction through the experiment; this device was used to rotate plants in three dimensions at a speed of 4 rotations/min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Wheatgrass seeds were germinated under these conditions for 7 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p>
