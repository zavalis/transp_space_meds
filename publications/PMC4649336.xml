              <abstract>
                <p>Three-dimensional multicellular spheroids (MCS) of human cells are important in cancer research. We investigated possible mechanisms of MCS formation of thyroid cells. Both, normal Nthy-ori 3–1 thyroid cells and the poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells FTC-133 formed MCS within 7 and 14 days of culturing on a Random Positioning Machine (RPM), while a part of the cells continued to grow adherently in each culture. The FTC-133 cancer cells formed larger and numerous MCS than the normal cells. In order to explain the different behaviour, we analyzed the gene expression of <italic>IL6, IL7, IL8, IL17, OPN, NGAL</italic>, <italic>VEGFA</italic> and enzymes associated cytoskeletal or membrane proteins (<italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>TUBB</italic>, <italic>PFN1, CPNE1, TGM2, CD44, FLT1</italic>, <italic>FLK1, PKB, PKC, ERK1/2, Casp9, Col1A1)</italic> as well as the amount of secreted proteins (IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-17, OPN, NGAL, VEGFA). Several of these components changed during RPM-exposure in each cell line. Striking differences between normal and malignant cells were observed in regards to the expression of genes of <italic>NGAL</italic>, <italic>VEGFA</italic>, <italic>OPN</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>IL17</italic> and to the secretion of VEGFA, IL-17, and IL-6. These results suggest several gravi-sensitive growth or angiogenesis factors being involved in 3D formation of thyroid cells cultured under simulated microgravity.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Space travellers suffer of a variety of health problems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, changes in metabolism, cardiac problems and others. In addition, reduced thyroid hormone levels were found in the plasma of rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and astronauts returning from a space mission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> as well as in the supernatants of thyroid cancer cells cultured on a Random Positioning Machine (RPM)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Besides the direct impact of microgravity (μ<italic>g</italic>) on the human body, an influence on the cellular level has been found under altered gravity conditions. <italic>In vitro</italic>, simulated microgravity (s-μ<italic>g</italic>) induces three-dimensional (3D) growth in many cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Even though monolayer culture models are easy and convenient to set up with good viability of cells in culture, they lack the 3D microenvironment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The 3D culture of various cell types reflects the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation more precisely than two-dimensional (2D) cell culture techniques. Moreover, spheroids produce their own extracellular matrix (ECM) over time that differs in the relative amount and assembly from the corresponding monolayer cultures. Many cell types in 3D multicellular culture models were found to assume a more or less normal cellular architecture and exhibited gene expression profiles that were reflective of an authentic differentiated phenotype found in the real tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. By means of this experimental approach, mechanisms and pathways can be studied that control cancer cell growth and function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. 3D aggregates of cancer cells represent a simple model of a tumour. These multicellular spheroids (MCS) mimic small metastases and areas of solid tumours <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Changes occurring during 3D spheroid formation are not known in detail. Up to now cytoskeletal reorganizations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, altered gene expression and cytokine secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> have been described in the literature. But it is still unknown how the cells are able to sense altered gravity conditions, although current research hints in the direction of cytoskeletal changes.</p>
            <p>Therefore, further experiments on cells cultured under microgravity are required. For this purpose devices simulating microgravity on Earth are mainly used, because possibilities of performing experiments in Space are rare. In this study we used the RPM, which prevents sedimentation by randomization of the <italic>g</italic>-vector<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and exposed normal and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTC). PDTC is a distinct diagnostic entity and its incidence is 2–3% of thyroid cancers in North America<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p>
            <p>There are several cell lines, which enable meaningful research on this disease. The FTC-133 cell line was derived from a PDTC from a 42-year-old male patient<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. It comprises follicular thyroid cancer cells, which formed large 3D aggregates, when cultured under real microgravity (r-μ<italic>g</italic>) and simulated μ<italic>g</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In this paper we investigated FTC-133 cultured for 7 and 14 days on the RPM in comparison to non-malignant human thyroid cells of the line Nthy-ori 3–1. It is a primary thyroid follicular epithelial cell line originating from human tissue, which was stably transfected with plasmid DNA containing an origin-defective simian-virus 40 (SV-40) genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The immortalized cell line inherits thyroid specific functions, namely iodide-trapping and thyroglobulin production, and showed no tumorigenesis when transplanted into nude mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>.</p>
            <p>The principal aim of this study was firstly to investigate the changes of poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells and normal thyroid cells, when they are cultured under simulated microgravity conditions. A similar reaction of both cell types to the microgravity environment may be due to a general reaction of cells to low-gravity conditions.</p>
            <p>In addition, we examined the differences in the formation of MCS of normal cells versus cancer cells on the RPM. We focused on specific cytokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, cytoskeletal proteins or proteins which are necessary for growth and metastasis.</p>
            <p>Healthy Nthy-ori 3–1 cells and FTC-133 follicular thyroid cancer cells were exposed to simulated microgravity on the RPM for different time periods in order to investigate differences in the formation of multicellular spheroids. We expected that finding similarities might hint to triggers of MCS formation, whereas differences will increase our knowledge in cancer biology. In addition, we characterized 3D multicellular spheroids tissue-engineered on the RPM and examined the cytokine secretion by the thyroid cells. The study revealed that several factors promoting angiogenesis such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) are sensitive to simulated microgravity in thyroid cells cultured on the RPM.</p>

When a culture flask containing a subconfluent monolayer had been incubated on a RPM for 7 days, two types of Nthy-ori 3–1 cell populations could be distinguished. They grew either within a monolayer adhering to the bottom of the culture flaks (RPM AD), or within detached cells, which formed MCS (RPM MCS) and are floating in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, in the samples exposed for 14 days, no further increase in the number of MCS was detectable, whereas the size of the individual MCS had clearly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

                <p>To get a deeper understanding of the 3D spheroid formation, the actin filament (F-actin) system of the samples was investigated after a 7-day-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I–N</xref>). Both cell lines showed comparable F-actin patterns in 1<italic>g</italic>-control adherent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I,L</xref>) as well as in RPM AD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1J,M</xref>) and RPM MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1K,N</xref>). In 1<italic>g</italic>-control cells, F-actin presented an equal distribution and an accumulation towards the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1I,L</xref>). In contrast, the RPM AD cells demonstrated a perinuclear clustering of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1J,M</xref>), but RPM MCS showed a diffuse and unorganized pattern.

                <p>In addition to the F-actin studies, the expression of <italic>β-actin</italic> gene (<italic>ACTB</italic>) was measured in static 1<italic>g</italic> cells, RPM AD cells and RPM MCS, respectively, after 7 and 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). After 7 days, FTC-133 RPM AD and RPM MCS cells showed a significant up-regulation of <italic>ACTB</italic> compared to the static 1<italic>g</italic>-control, whereas Nthy-ori 3–1 RPM-samples showed a significant up-regulation in RPM AD cells, but a down-regulation in RPM MCS.

                <p>Another important part of the cytoskeleton are the microtubules. Investigations on the gene expression of <italic>β-tubulin</italic> (<italic>TUBB</italic>) after 7 days of culturing on the RPM revealed a significant up-regulation in RPM AD cells of the FTC-133 and Nthy-ori 3–1cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). In addition, the gene expression of <italic>TUBB</italic> was slightly elevated in FTC-133 cells, whereas Nthy-ori 3–1 cells showed a significant down-regulation of the <italic>TUBB</italic> mRNA. After 14 days, both cell lines showed an increased gene expression of <italic>TUBB</italic> in RPM AD cells as well as in spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>).</p>
                <p>Profilin is an important actin binding protein, which has an impact on actin polymerization.

                <p>In addition to the examination of the cytoskeleton, gene expression and release of signalling factors playing a role in angiogenesis and metastasis were investigated.

                <p>The <italic>VEGF</italic> gene expression in 7-day-samples revealed a mostly unchanged <italic>VEGF</italic> expression in FTC-133 RPM AD cells and a significant down-regulation in RPM MCS compared to the 1<italic>g-</italic>control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). Nthy-ori 3–1 showed a significant up-regulation in RPM AD cells and a significant down-regulation in RPM MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). After a 14-day-exposure FTC-133 cells exhibited a static <italic>VEGF</italic> expression in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), whereas Nthy-ori 3–1 cells showed a significant up-regulation in RPM AD cells and a <italic>VEGF</italic> mRNA level, comparable to 1<italic>g</italic>-controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
                <p>After binding to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2; fetal liver kinase 1(FLK1)) several signalling cascades are activated which results in proliferation and survival of the cell.

                <p>Examination of the gene expression of the downstream signalling molecules ERK1 and ERK2 revealed comparable results.

                <p>The corresponding receptors to VEGF are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1)) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (FLK1).

                <title>Impact of simulated microgravity on cell growth</title>
                <p>Devices designed to simulate microgravity conditions on Earth like the Rotating Wall Vessel or the RPM proved to be useful for tissue engineering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Apart from simulated microgravity, several other methods to tissue-engineer spheroids such as the hanging drop technique, the carboxymethyl cellulose as well as spinnerflask method or the liquid overlay technique<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> are known, but there is a lack of systematic studies evaluating the performance of these techniques. Moreover, these methods also do not reproduce the real tissue formation procedure. Real organ culture is not without its own problems; with difficulties in obtaining specimens and a poor viability of the tissues in culture being major obstacles. As animal models and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are costly and complex with problems of unpredictable characteristics and ethical approval, physiological 3D model systems using human cells to create an authentic model is an obvious choice. With the recent advances in tissue engineering, 3D cultures are now more morphologically and functionally differentiated and can be produced in larger quantities as a result of greater control over culture composition and greater choice in the method of inducing 3D growth.</p>
                <p>Here we show that the RPM promoted a scaffold-free formation of MCS of normal thyroid cells like it induced spheroid formation in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer cells and in chondrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> earlier. However, we found a different growth behaviour for both cell lines. After a 7-day-exposure of FTC-133 on the RPM large and numerous MCS were found, which even increased in size during the following week. In contrast, the Nthy-ori 3–1 cells produced many small MCS in 7 days. They did not further grow in number until 14 days, but only in size. The different findings for spheroid growth could be explained by the nature of the cell lines (highly aggressive cancer cell line vs. benign thyroid cell line) and their inherent basic growth factor production and secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>F-actin staining indicated cytoskeletal changes, which have already been described for various cell types, like chondrocytes, thyroid cancer cells, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and others after different time periods of exposure to real and simulated microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The cytoskeletal structure of all these cell types reacted in a similar way to microgravity. This strongly suggests that the cytoskeleton may act as a general gravi-sensor and that the cytoskeleton remodelling process may play a key role for 3D growth of each cell type.</p>
                <p>Beta-actin is one of six different actin isoforms and a non-muscle cytoskeletal actin. Because the actin proteins are involved in cell motility, structure and integrity, we have focused on the <italic>ACTB</italic> gene expression. In FTC-133 cells an increase in <italic>ACTB</italic> mRNA was detectable in both RPM AD and RPM MCS samples at both time periods compared with static 1<italic>g</italic>-controls. In Nthy-ori 3–1 cells a non-significant down-regulation of <italic>ACTB</italic> was found in RPM MCS samples after 7 days. The <italic>ACTB</italic> up-regulation may be due to gravitational loading and induce a shape deformation, which can result in 3D formation. The down-regulation of <italic>ACTB</italic> after 7 days on the RPM in Nthy-ori 3–1 MCS might also be a reason why the size of the spheroids is not as big as the size of FTC-133 spheroids. Alterations of the cellular architecture can trigger cellular responses to their environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.</p>
                <p>Similar results were obtained for the quantification of <italic>TUBB</italic> mRNA. A <italic>TUBB</italic> up-regulation was found in RPM AD and RPM MCS in 7- and 14-day FTC-133 samples compared with 1<italic>g-</italic>controls. <italic>TUBB</italic> gene expression was blunted in Nthy-ori 3–1 RPM MCS after a 7-day-exposure. Earlier it was shown that microtubules struggle to build up <italic>in vitro</italic> when exposed to a microgravity environment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The results could be explained as follows: due to gravitational unloading, the shape of the AD cells is changed. To counteract the deformation, the cell reacts by an up-regulation of <italic>β-tubulin</italic>. The difference between RPM AD cells and RPM MCS could be due to the different stages. The AD cells fight to maintain their 2D-cell layer and to grow adherently while the cells in MCS are already growing three-dimensionally.</p>
                <p>Profilin-1 is mainly responsible for actin fibre polymerization and reacts to extracellular signals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. An over-expression of <italic>PFN1</italic> suppresses micro-metastasis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in nude mice. In addition, an up-regulation of <italic>PFN1</italic> could inhibit mobility and invasion in breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. In contrast, profilin-1 was found to be over-expressed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), indicating its potential as a diagnostic or progression biomarker and a possible target in RCC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Long-term culture of FTC-133 cells on the RPM, resulted in an up-regulation of <italic>PFN1</italic> mRNA after 7 days in RPM AD cells and RPM MCS, whereas after 14 days there was a static expression. This might indicate a tumour-suppressive ability of microgravity, which was also described in different experiments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p>

                <title>Factors involved in tumour growth and angiogenesis</title>
                <p>VEGF is a very important factor for 3D aggregation and is involved in angiogenesis and tumourigenesis and is of special interest because it is mitogenic, angiogenic, and a potent mediator of vascular permeability as well as essential to grow tissue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. The amount of secreted VEGF protein in FTC-133 cells was about 12-fold higher than in Nthy-ori 3–1 cells. This may be the major reason for the different morphological appearance shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. However, the involvement of other growth factors, such as Epidermal Growth Factor and Connective Tissue Growth Factor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> has to be considered. In both types of cells the VEGF in sample supernatants was lower, when they were exposed to simulated microgravity for 7 days compared with their relevant 1<italic>g</italic>-controls. An extremely low VEGF in RPM samples may induce the enhancement of <italic>VEGF</italic> gene expression in RPM AD cells of Nthy-ori 3–1 and might be one reason why this cell line is able to produce MCS on the RPM at all. Previous experiments, investigating VEGF in FTC-133 for short-term (31 parabolas) and long-term (10 days) studies in real microgravity revealed an up-regulation of <italic>VEGF</italic> after 31 parabolas and a down-regulation after 10 days of real microgravity in Space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> for FTC-133 cells. These results are in agreement with the RPM findings and it may be concluded that VEGF is in part responsible for the early development of MCS, but does not participate in later stages of 3D growth.</p>
                <p>FLT-1 (VEGFR-1) and FLK-1 (VEGFR-2) are the major receptors of VEGF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> and are expressed on endothelial cells as well as on a variety of tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. VEGFR-2 is suggested to be the major mediator of endothelial cell mitogenesis, survival, angiogenesis and vascular permeability. In contrast, VEGFR-1 seems not to be involved in mediating mitogenic effects on endothelial cells rather than blocking the mitogenic effect by sequestering with VEGF<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. After a 7- and 14-day-exposure only FTC-133 demonstrated <italic>VEGFR</italic> expression. After 7 days <italic>VEGFR-1</italic> and <italic>VEGFR-2</italic> were significantly up-regulated in RPM AD and RPM MCS. After 14 days however, the expression was static. These results are in concert with findings, that VEGFR-1 is especially needed in early development<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>.</p>
                <p>Upon binding of VEGF to its corresponding receptors, several signalling pathways are activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Phosphorylation of PKC is followed by activation of ERK1 and ERK2, which in the end favours cell proliferation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We found <italic>PKC</italic> gene-expression to be only slightly up-regulated in FTC-133 cells after 14 days. In contrast, Nthy-ori 3–1 cells rotated for 7 days showed a highly up-regulated <italic>PKC</italic> gene expression in adherent cells (AD) and a significant up-regulation in both cell populations after 14 days. These findings are in concert with the results obtained for the gene-expression of the downstream molecules ERK1 and ERK2 demonstrating comparable results for both cell lines. Thus, it can be concluded that culturing cells on the RPM favours the proliferation of cells. The differences between the cell lines might also explain why the MCS of Nthy-ori 3–1 are much smaller than the ones of FTC-133.</p>
                <p>Another signalling pathway which is activated by VEGF binding inherits PKB which negatively regulates caspase-9, resulting in cell survival. PKB-Caspase-9 demonstrated a comparable picture as PKC-ERK1/ERK2. Thus, the up-regulation of <italic>Casp9</italic> hints to an increased apoptotic behaviour of the cells. The apoptotic effect of microgravity was already demonstrated using the follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line ML-1 for 24 h and 48 h<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p>
                <p>In this study, we additionally investigated several proteins, which are known to be involved in cellular growth and differentiation. We focused on <italic>CD44</italic>, which is a multifaceted transmembrane glycoprotein. It establishes transmembrane complexes and organizes signalling cascades via association with the actin cytoskeleton. It is able to monitor changes in the extracellular matrix and triggers cell growth, survival and differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Interestingly, after RPM-exposure, the expression of <italic>CD44</italic> was unaffected. Nevertheless, a role of CD44 in the perception of gravity should be considered. It can be activated by OPN, whose presence is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A,B,M</xref>), to modify integrin interaction with the extracellular matrix<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Moreover, the elevated IL-6 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A,B,H</xref>) could be due to activated CD44 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. This suggests that <italic>CD44</italic> might be involved in the perception of altered gravity, having an actin cytoskeleton remodelling effect, although its mRNA concentration is not changed.</p>
                <p>In the next step, we focused on copine 1. Copine 1 is expressed in a variety of different tissues, such as brain, heart, lung, liver and kidney<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. It was shown that copine 1 plays a pivotal role in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, and metastatic functions. An over-expression of copine 1 was linked to abolishing nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells (NF-κB) transcription<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>. <italic>CPNE1</italic> mRNAs are clearly up-regulated in both cell lines after RPM-culture so that we will focus on NF- κB signalling in future studies.</p>
                <p>Another factor playing a role in 3D growth and metastasis is TGM2, which is highly over-expressed in a variety of tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. <italic>TGM2</italic> is a stress-responsive gene and its expression is frequently up-regulated during inflammation and wounding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>. A forced or basal high expression of <italic>TGM2</italic> leads to a constitutive activation of NF- κB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. <italic>TGM2</italic> expression is associated with poor disease outcome, increased drug resistance, and increased incidence of metastasis. In FTC-133 <italic>TGM2</italic> is highly up-regulated upon RPM-exposure after 7 and still after 14 days. In contrast, Nthy-ori 3–1 cells only showed an over-expression after 7 days and a static expression after 14 days. These results suggest that <italic>TGM2</italic> has an impact on the formation and proliferation of MCS in general, irrespective of malignant or non-malignant cells. The static expression in Nthy-ori 3–1 cells after 14 days might also be the reason for smaller diameters of MCS and lower MCS numbers.</p>
                <p>Measurement of the IL-6 content after the experimental procedure revealed a much higher level in the supernatant of the Nthy-ori cells and a significant increase in all RPM-samples of both cell lines compared with the corresponding 1<italic>g-</italic>controls. The cytokine IL-6 is an important factor in angiogenesis and metastasis. IL-6 has the capability to act on every cell type and is known to be highly elevated in some tumour types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>. As IL-6 is a potent factor triggering survival and proliferation via osteopontin, PKC, PKB and VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). It is of special interest concerning the development of 3D-aggregates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. An increase in <italic>IL6</italic> mRNA was found in RPM adherent (AD) cells of both cell lines at both time points. In MCS <italic>IL6</italic> was down-regulated in both cell lines after a 7-day-exposure. In contrast to the results in this study, experiments using human endothelial cells displayed no changes concerning IL-6 although 3D-aggregates were formed, but these 3D structures were a mixture of intima constructs (tubes) and MCS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Taken together, it can be suggested that the IL-6 secretion is cell-type-dependent, but has a strong impact on continuous growth of adherent cells under microgravity. It has been shown in phase II studies, that the extent of increase in IL-6 in the plasma during treatment was associated with an inferior outcome in patients with rectal and ovarian cancer after bevacizumab and chemoradiation treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>, and with an inferior outcome in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma after sunitinib therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>.</p>
                <p>IL-8 has an influence on proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. For this reason, IL-8 might also play a role in the development of 3D-aggregates. The <italic>IL8</italic> gene expression in both cell lines and at both time points was similar. There was an increase of <italic>IL8</italic> in RPM AD cells and a down-regulation in MCS. The release of IL-8 protein was similar in FTC-133 and Nthy-ori 3–1 samples and did not change in RPM samples compared with 1<italic>g-</italic>samples of both cell lines at day 7. In contrast to data in this study, experiments with FTC-133 cells on the RPM and in Space for 10 days presented a down-regulation of <italic>IL8</italic> in AD cells and MCS as well as a significantly lower IL-8-content in the supernatant<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. It can be concluded that the IL-8 expression and secretion occurs in a time-dependent manner.</p>
                <p>The discovery of IL-17 was a coincidence, as the multianalyte profiling (MAP) included the test for this cytokine. IL-17 is secreted by specialized Th17 cells of the immune system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>. That is why it is surprising that <italic>IL17</italic> mRNA is expressed by thyroid cells. Why thyroid cells express <italic>IL17</italic> is not known to date, however, simulated microgravity using the RPM has an impact on the expression of this cytokine and might contribute to the expression of IL-6 and IL-8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 plays a potential role in T-cell-mediated angiogenesis and promotes tumourigenicity of human cervical cancer. The expression of IL-17 in human colorectal cancer was reported in 2006<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>. It has not yet been reported that IL-17 is secreted by thyroid cells. Both cell lines released the IL-17 protein in the supernatant after 7 days.</p>
                <p>We focused on the cell adhesion molecule osteopontin, which is known to play an essential role in two key aspects of tumour progression: VEGF expression by tumour cells and VEGF-stimulated neovascularization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>. Osteopontin is highly expressed in a variety of tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.</p>
                <p>Follicular thyroid carcinoma cells are constantly producing osteopontin, but conditions of simulated microgravity might enhance the production of this protein. After 7 and 14 days we observed a clear increase of <italic>OSP</italic> mRNA in RPM AD cells and RPM MCS compared with 1<italic>g-</italic>samples in FTC-133 cells. This might explain the huge FTC-133 tumour spheroids. <italic>OSP</italic> mRNA was detectable after 14 days in Nthy-ori 3–1 cells and clearly elevated in RPM MCS. Nthy-ori 3–1 cells seem to react to simulated microgravity much later with a production of osteopontin, which might also influence the size of the spheroids.</p>
                <p>A 24-hour-exposure of FTC-133 cells to conditions of simulated microgravity resulted in an up-regulation of <italic>OSP</italic> in RPM AD cells but in a down-regulation in RPM MCS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Ten days of real microgravity induced a down-regulation of <italic>OSP</italic> in AD cells and MCS, but using an RPM for 10 days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> mirrors the results obtained in this work. A reason for this may be cosmic radiation in Space, as well as vibration or hypergravity effects during launch have to be taken into account. Based on its role as mediator of cell-matrix adhesion and communication, osteopontin has the potential to profoundly influence tumourigenesis and invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref> and thus, also 3D growth.</p>
                <p>NGAL is a glycoprotein and seems to represent a marker of malignant follicular cell-derived thyroid tumours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>. In malignant cells, NGAL seems to inhibit apoptosis (in thyroid cancer cells), invasion and angiogenesis (in pancreatic cancer) as well as to enhance proliferation and metastasis (in breast and colon cancer)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>. The NGAL protein release was significantly increased in FTC-133 cells compared with 1g-control cells, whereas Nthy-ori 3–1 cells did not secrete the protein at day 7. In SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells, the levels of VEGF and IL-6 were decreased after NGAL silencing, suggesting that NGAL controls VEGF and cytokine production and it may be common among cancer cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>. This should be investigated in future experiments to clarify whether this is a novel mechanism through which NGAL may promote tumour angiogenesis and progression.</p>
                <p>The extracellular matrix protein collagen-1 was postulated to be important for the formation of 3D-aggregates whilst being enhanced after 1 up to 5 days of simulated microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>. We found <italic>Col1A1</italic> to be down-regulated for FTC-133 cells after 7 and 14 days, but up-regulated in the non-malignant cells. In an earlier study, investigating the ML-1 cell line (another poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cell line) for 24 and 48 h on the 3D clinostat we measured an increase in the production of several extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I and III, laminin, fibronectin, chondroitin sulfate) compared with controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. The Proteomics results of the recent spaceflight experiment Cellbox-1 revealed in a subsequent protein analysis 180 proteins by mass spectrometry<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>. These proteins suggested that the increased protein synthesis related to the ECM could detain the cells from MCS formation, when the cells are completely confluent at the time point, when the microgravity experiment starts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>. Short-term microgravity during a parabolic flight altered the gene expression of extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules: <italic>COL</italic>4A5 mRNA was down-regulated under microgravity, whereas <italic>OPN</italic> and <italic>FN</italic> were significantly up-regulated<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. It was shown that the gravi-response of ML-1 cells occurred very early, within the first few seconds. These findings suggest a time-dependent and cell type-dependent regulation, which might also explain the smaller MCS formed by the non-malignant cell line.</p>

                <title>Additional soluble factors released in the supernatant</title>
                <p>As detected by MAP profiling several cytokines were released by FTC-133 in the supernatant after 7 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). An increased secretion was measured for GM-CSF, MIP-1 alpha, interleukins (IL-1 beta, IL-1ra, IL-12p40, IL-15) and SCF. In contrast, the release of MMP-3, ICAM-1, BDNF, Eotaxin-1, IL-1alpha, Il-12p70, and IL-23 in FTC-133 cells remained unchanged.

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Taken these results together, we could show that both cell types form 3D aggregates on the RPM after long-term exposure. But speed and extensions are different. There is an influence between the cytoskeleton and the cytokines mediated by kinases and/or membrane binding proteins, as well as a regulation of cytokines among themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). This study also suggests that growth and angiogenic factors determine differences in spheroid formation behaviour of the malignant and the healthy thyroid cells. Cytoskeleton dynamics are regulated by IL-8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref> as well as by osteopontin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The differential expression of these cytokines may contribute to the morphological appearance of the cells exposed to simulated microgravity on the RPM. In addition, IL-17 has a regulatory impact on IL-8 and IL-6 expression, which in turn regulates the expression of VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). Moreover, NGAL may influence and control VEGF and cytokine production in thyroid cancer cells grown under conditions of microgravity. Taking into account that the non-malignant cell line does not express the VEGFRs in a measurable amount at the investigated time points, however, reacts with an up-regulation of downstream signalling molecules, may hint either to a delayed reaction to the simulated microgravity or to further signalling molecules which are involved in 3D-aggregate formation. How NGAL and VEGF interact in detail to transform adherent cells to 3D-aggregates has to be investigated in future studies. IL-6 could be a candidate that is influencing the cytoskeleton via ACTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
              <p>In summary, it can be concluded that the formation of multicellular spheroids is occurring in thyroid cancer cells as well as in normal cells, a finding, which shows that simulated microgravity is a usable approach for engineering functional tissue. These functional tissues might be used in the future for pharmacological testing or co-culture experiments to investigate neoangiogenesis inhibitors, yielding a more accurate picture than mouse or rat models.</p>

                <title>Cell culture</title>
                <p>Nthy-ori 3–1 primary human thyroid follicular epithelial cells and FTC-133 human follicular thyroid carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Naerum, Denmark) medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies) and cultured under standard cell culture conditions at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. One day prior to the RPM experiment, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were counted and seeded into T25cm<sup>2</sup> vented cell culture flasks (Sarstedt, Newton, USA) or 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into slide flasks (Thermo Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) for cytoskeleton investigations. To avoid shear stress, each flask was completely filled with medium, taking care that no air bubbles remained in the cell culture flasks. The flasks were installed on the RPM and run for the time and mode of interest. Corresponding static 1<italic>g-</italic>controls were prepared in parallel and were stored next to the device in the same incubator. During the 14-day-experiments, the medium had to be changed after 7 days to ensure the exchange of waste and nutrients. The flasks were positioned upright for 15 minutes to allow sedimentation of MCS. Afterwards, the old medium was aspirated carefully to ensure no disturbance and refilled with fresh medium. Then the flasks were installed on the devices to continue the experiment. At day 7 and day 14, the cells were investigated and photographed. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 4 °C to collect the MCS. After centrifugation the supernatant was collected for cytokine investigation on ice and then frozen at −20 °C. The MCS were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen.</p>
                <p>To harvest the adherent cells, 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Life Technologies) were carefully added to each T25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask and the cells were scraped off with a scraper. The cell suspension was collected and centrifuged at 4 °C. The PBS was discarded and the dry pellet was stored in liquid nitrogen.</p>

                <p>The network of interaction can be divided in three parts. Above the upper red line, a cluster of cytokines and some of their receptors can be seen. A cluster of cytoskeletal proteins is visible below the lower red line. Between the two red lines, kinases and membrane-binding proteins are shown, which may mediate the effects of the cytokines on the cytoskeleton. The entities shown on yellow background indicate proteins/genes, which are regulated in different ways, when malignant and normal thyroid cells form spheroids. Additional proteins: KDR: Kinase insert domain receptor, LCN2: Lipocalin 2, and SPP1: secreted phosphoprotein 1 (OSP).</p>
