                <p>It is well documented that microgravity in space environment leads to bone loss in astronauts. These physiological changes have also been validated by human and animal studies and modeled in cell-based analogs. However, the underlying mechanisms are elusive. In the current study, we identified a novel phenomenon that primary cilia (key sensors and functioning organelles) of rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) gradually shrank and disappeared almost completely after exposure to simulated microgravity generated by a random positioning machine (RPM). Along with the abrogation of primary cilia, the differentiation, maturation and mineralization of ROBs were inhibited. We also found that the disappearance of primary cilia was prevented by treating ROBs with cytochalasin D, but not with LiCl or dynein light chain Tctex-type 1 (Dynlt1) siRNA. The repression of the differentiation, maturation and mineralization of ROBs was effectively offset by cytochalasin D treatment in microgravity conditions. Blocking ciliogenesis using intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) siRNA knockdown inhibited the ability of cytochalasin D to counteract this reduction of osteogenesis. These results indicate that the abrogation of primary cilia may be responsible for the microgravity’s inhibition on osteogenesis. Reconstruction of primary cilia may become a potential strategy against bone loss induced by microgravity.</p>

              <p>Along with the growing number of flights in space, more and more astronauts will be exposed to a harsh environment. While modern spacecrafts are designed to be effective barriers against many of the detrimental conditions such as extreme temperature and ionizing radiation, exposure to microgravity remains an unresolved issue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Microgravity causes various problems in different biological systems including atrophy of the muscular system, dysfunction of the immune system, electrolyte imbalance and cardiovascular anomalies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. One of the most prominent and well recognized physiological challenges accompanying an extended spaceflight is the reduction in bone mass and osteopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Bone loss during spaceflights has been reproduced on the ground by microgravity-based research both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. One ground analog to microgravity is bed rest study, in which subjects remain in bed at a 6 degree head-down tilt from weeks to months in time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. There are reductions of bone mass in cancellous bone areas, with losses of 1.0% in the distal femur, 3.0% in the patella, and 2.0% in the distal tibia in a 35 day bed rest trial. After 56 days and 90 days, bone mass in the distal tibia declines 3.6% and 6.0% correspondingly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. For animal studies, the hind-limb suspension model is commonly used for rats and the effect of weightlessness on hind limbs is produced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Hindlimb unloading decreases the number of osteoblasts in the metaphysis of the tibia after 5 days, and reduces the trabecular bone volume by 14 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Experiments undertaken with clinostat devices using osteogenic cell cultures facilitate the evaluation of the biological effects of microgravity on the functional activities of osteoblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>A random positioning machine (RPM) is a particular kind of 3D clinostat with two independently rotating frames driven by independent motors, which has been successfully used to simulate microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. One frame is positioned inside the other giving a very complex net change of orientation to a biological specimen. From the sample’s point of view, the gravity vector’s trajectory averaged over time shall converge toward zero. As a result, the biological specimen will experience a state similar to microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Researches have demonstrated that microgravity simulated by a RPM suppresses the expression levels of various osteogenesis makers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx-2), osteocalcin (OCN) and type 1 collagen (COL-1) and formation of mineralized nodules in cultured MC3T3 or 2T3 preosteoblasts and other osteoblastic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms of microgravity-inhibited osteogenesis are almost completely unclear as this process is multistage and complex.</p>
              <p>Primary cilium is a solitary organelle that emanates from the surface of most mammalian cells, which has been proved as a key coordinator of signaling pathways to respond mechanical and chemical stimuli. Since a variety of receptors, ion channels and transporter proteins have been localized to the cilium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, its role as a mechanosensor has been established. Primary cilium will change its orientation in response to mechanical stimuli and trigger biochemical and transcriptional changes. This phenomenon has been identified and confirmed in kidney epithelial cells, osteocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, and cholangiocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. For example, mechanotransduction of fluid flow bends the primary cilium to induce specified gene expression by decreasing cAMP contents in osteocytes or activating calcium channel to mediate intracellular calcium mobilization in kidney cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Defects in primary cilium structure or mutations disrupting ciliogenesis will lead to a variety of developmental abnormalities and postnatal disorders, including oral-facial-digital syndromes, Bardet-Biedl syndromes and ossification disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that some pharmacological agents and extracellular environmental changes can alter the primary cilia length. Lithium treatment causes primary cilia to extend in several cell types via the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) or adenylate cyclase III (ACIII)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, changes the microtubule network with a subsequent increase in soluble tubulin levels and results in a primary cilium elongation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Besides, it is widely recognized that there is a balance between cilia length and intraflagellar transport (IFT). The IFT particles and their associated cargo proteins are transported along axonemal microtubules by kinesin-2 motor proteins in the anterograde direction and by cytoplasmic dynein-2 in the retrograde direction. Blocking dynein-2 function by depleting dynein light chain 1 (DYNLT1) causes an increase in cilia length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>Inspired by its established role as a mechanosensor, we hypothesize that the primary cilium is a critical target of microgravity stimuli. Along with the extension ability, the primary cilium may become a potential candidate against bone loss. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the changes in behavior of primary cilia of rat calvarial osteoblasts (ROBs) responding to RPM treatment, and analysed effects on osteogenesis by determining the differentiation, maturation and mineralization of osteoblasts. The effects of modulating formation or length of primary cilia on osteogenesis in a microgravity condition were also investigated using pharmacological agents or molecular approaches. Our results demonstrated that primary cilia played an important role in keeping the normal state of osteoblasts in microgravity condition.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity abrogates the primary cilia of ROBs</title>
                <p>Enlightened by the response of primary cilia to mechanical stimuli, we speculate that microgravity impacts the primary cilium. ROBs were treated with RPM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A–C</xref>) for 6 h, 12 h and 24 h respectively. The cilia were investigated under a laser confocal microscopy after immunofluorescence staining of acetylated α-tubulin, the main component of cilia. Surprisingly, it was found that the number of ROBs with primary cilia was greatly decreased after 6 h of RPM treatment, and continued to decline with time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). The residual primary cilia became obviously shorter and dotted. Compared to the normal ground group, simulated microgravity caused a reduction of 60.5 ± 10.4% at 6 h (P &lt; 0.05), 83.7 ± 4.4% at 12 h (P &lt; 0.01) and 85.7 ± 1.9% at 24 h (P &lt; 0.01) in the percentage of cells with primary cilia (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>).

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, although there were no significant differences between 0 h group and SMG groups at 2 h and 4 h, the acetylated α-tubulin levels were significantly reduced at 6 h, and continued to decrease up to 24 h (P &lt; 0.01), implying a general suppression effect on the acetylated α-tubulin of osteoblasts in the microgravity condition.

                <p>First, we checked the lengths of primary cilia in the normal ground condition after ROBs were treated with 5 mM LiCl, 0.1 μM cytochalasin D (Cyto D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization), or siRNA of Dynlt1 (dynein light chain Tctex-type 1), which were all reported to be able to elongate the primary cilia by different mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, all treatments increased the lengths of primary cilia to some extents (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A,C,D</xref>). Lithium elongated primary cilia from 4.86 ± 0.58 μm (Ctrl group) to 11.62 ± 1.29 μm (LiCl group). Particularly, some cilia even reached a maximal length of 14.52 μm. The lengths of primary cilia in Cyto D group reached an average of 9.96 ± 2.29 μm (P &lt; 0.01, compared with Ctrl). Dynlt1 siRNA showed the weakest elongating ability but still significantly increased the lengths of primary cilia to 8.62 ± 1.83 μm (P &lt; 0.01, compared with Ctrl). Besides, Cyto D significantly increased the fraction of cells with primary cilia from 69.4 ± 1.7% to 81.7 ± 3.0%, while no such effects were found in LiCl and Dynlt1 siRNA groups.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Elongation of cilia prevents the abrogation of primary cilia induced by simulated microgravity.

</p>
                <p>Next, we examined the effects of ciliogenesis intervention treatments on the lengths of primary cilia in the microgravity condition. The primary cilia in Ctrl, LiCl and Dynlt1 siRNA groups became obviously shorter and dotted (compared with NG group of each treatment, P &lt; 0.01) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A,C,D</xref>), with a reduction of 83.7 ± 3.2% in the percentage of cells displaying primary cilia (from 69.6 ± 1.6% to 11.9 ± 2.4%, P &lt; 0.01) in the LiCl group and 82.0 ± 1.8% reduction (from 67.9 ± 1.6% to 12.8 ± 1.1%, P &lt; 0.01) in the Dynlt1 siRNA group. However, the primary cilia were maintained in the Cyto D group, with only a reduction of 14.9 ± 0.9% in the percentage of cells displaying primary cilia (from 81.7 ± 3.0% to 69.7 ± 2.9%). In addition, the cells in the Cyto D group displayed significantly longer primary cilia (with an average length of 6.10 ± 1.13 μm) than those in the Ctrl of SMG group (0.84 ± 1.24 μm, P &lt; 0.01), which were also longer than cilia of cells in Ctrl of NG group (4.86 ± 0.58 μm, P &lt; 0.01).</p>
                <p>Then, we further analysed the treatment effects on primary cilia by examining the total protein levels of acetylated α-tubulin after LiCl, Cyto D or Dynlt1 siRNA treatment with or without RPM exposure. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E and F</xref>, LiCl, Cyto D or Dynlt1 siRNA treatment significantly increased the acetylated α-tubulin levels in the normal ground condition (P &lt; 0.01, compared with Ctrl of NG groups). However, the acetylated α-tubulin levels of Ctrl, LiCl and Dynlt1 siRNA groups were significantly decreased in the microgravity condition (P &lt; 0.01, compared with NG group of each treatment). Strikingly, Cyto D treatment resulted in the highest acetylated α-tubulin level in SMG groups (P &lt; 0.01, compared with Ctrl of SMG groups). Taken together, the above results suggest that Cyto D has the ability to prevent the abrogation of primary cilia induced by simulated microgravity.</p>

                <p>To confirm the ability of Cyto D in offsetting microgravity-induced osteogenesis repression is due to the preservation of primary cilia, we blocked ciliogenesis using siRNA sequence targeting IFT88, an essential component for the assembly and maintenance of primary cilia, and then examined treatment effects on the differentiation of ROBs in simulated microgravity condition with Cyto D. IFT88 siRNA treatment for 24 h significantly decreased the protein expression levels of IFT88 (P &lt; 0.01 compared to scrambled siRNA control). As expected and as examined by immunofluorescence staining, after IFT88 siRNA treatment, primary cilia became dotted and obviously shorter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8A and B</xref>), and the number of ROBs with primary cilia was reduced from 66.4 ± 1.2% to 17.0 ± 2.1% (P &lt; 0.01, Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>).

A lack of mechanical stimulation has been linked to bone loss in osteoporosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism for this link is unclear. The primary cilium has been proposed to function as a mechanosensor to translate loading-induced signals into biochemical and transcriptional responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that primary cilia play an indispensable role in osteogenesis process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Yan <italic>et al</italic>. found that blocking ciliogenesis using siRNA-mediated depletion of IFT88 inhibited the promoting effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on osteogenic differentiation of ROBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

In the present work we identified, for the first time, that primary cilia of ROBs were almost completely depleted after 24 h of RPM microgravity treatment. Microgravity-induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation, maturation and mineralization of ROBs were closely associated with the abrogation of primary cilia. These results indicate that RPM-induced disrupting of primary cilia may play a key role in microgravity-induced reduction in osteogenesis.</p>

              <p>Studies have found that microgravity-induced changes in actin cytoskeleton are responsible for the reduction in osteogenesis. In particular, Dai <italic>et al</italic>. reported that actin microfilaments participate in BMP-2 activity in activating Runx-2 and that their disruption might be an important contributor to microgravity-induced inhibition on BMP-2 activity in osteogenic induction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In the present study, we found that microgravity-induced abrogation of primary cilia may be another underlying mechanism for the microgravity inhibitory effect on osteogenesis. We have shown that Cyto D effectively maintained the existence of primary cilia in the microgravity condition and offset the reduction in osteogenesis caused by RPM exposure, and that blocking ciliogenesis using siRNA knockdown of IFT88 inhibited the ability of cytochalasin D to counteract the reduction of osteogenesis. However, it has been known that there are intrinsic connections between cytoskeleton changes and primary cilia. For example, Espinha <italic>et al</italic>. found that primary cilia could regulate alterations in the cytoplasmic microtubule network in response to mechanical stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, future work is required to determine whether microgravity affects actin cytoskeleton through primary cilia or abrogates the primary cilia by changing the actin network.</p>
              <p>In summary, microgravity-induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation, maturation and mineralization was closely associated with the abrogation of primary cilia. Cytochalasin D treatment could maintain primary cilia and effectively offset the reduction in osteogenesis caused by simulated microgravity. Primary cilia could be a potential therapeutic target against bone loss during space flights, and perhaps even disease-related bone loss due to immobilization and physical inactivity.</p>

                <p>Primary osteoblasts (ROBs) were isolated from the skull bones as described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> of neonatal SD rats obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine (Lanzhou, China). Animal experiments were approved by Animal Ethics Committee of Lanzhou General Hospital and were conducted according to NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. In brief, calvarias were dissected aseptically, cleaned of adhering soft tissues, minced to small pieces, digested at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin twice, 15 min for each time, and then with 1 mg/mL collagenase II (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) six times, 20 min for each time. The released cells from the last four digest supernatants were pooled and filtered through a 200-μm sieve to remove bone debris. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in α-MEM (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) plus 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The cells were seeded in flasks sealed with an aerated hydrophobic membrane. Flasks, incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 °C, were completely filled with fresh culture medium in order to prevent air bubbles and to minimize liquid flow. The cells from the first to third passages were used in the following experiments.</p>

                <p>The SM-31 random positioning machine (RPM) (Center for Space and Applied Research, Chinese Academy of Science, Lanzhou, China) which was used to simulate microgravity consists of a desktop RPM, a control console and a temperature sensors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The RPM contains two independent rotating frames. One frame is positioned inside the other giving a very complex net change of orientation to a biological sample mounted in the middle. Both frames can rotate randomly at 3-dimension in the range of 0–10 rpm with changes in the acceleration and direction of the biological sample over time. The RPM was placed in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37 °C and 100% humidity) to exposure biological samples to microgravity and it was connected to the control console outside of the incubator. In this study, ROBs were cultured in 50-ml flasks with an aerated hydrophobic membrane. After 24 h, flasks were completely filled with fresh culture medium and fixed on a 12.3 (length) × 9.8 (width) × 10 cm (height) cell culture vessel for RPM exposure. ROBs in the normal ground (NG) group were also seeded in flasks filled with fresh culture medium and were statically placed in the same CO<sub>2</sub> incubator with the RPM.</p>

Briefly, siRNA targeting Dynlt1 (sequence: 5′-GAAGAATGGTGCTGGGTTA-3′) and a scrambled control siRNA were synthesized, cloned into U6 vectors (Invitrogen) and transfected into ROBs using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as an indicator for success of transfection. Assays for evaluating Dynlt1 silencing efficiency were performed 24 h after transfection by Western blotting. To prevent cilium formation, ROBs were treated with a siRNA to knockdown the expression of intraflagellar transport 88 homolog (IFT88), a protein required for formation and assembly of cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. For IFT88 silencing, one siRNA targeting IFT88 (sequence: 5′-GGAUAUGGGUCCAAG ACAUCC-3′) and a corresponding scrambled negative control siRNA (Invitrogen) were used.
