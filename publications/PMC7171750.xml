                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">Spaceflight impacts astronauts in many ways but little is known on how spaceflight affects the salivary microbiome and the consequences of these changes on astronaut health, such as viral reactivation. In order to understand this, the salivary microbiome was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and saliva viral titers were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with primers specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) from 10 astronauts pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight.</p>

                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par2"><italic>Streptococcus</italic> was the most abundant organism in the saliva, making up 8% of the total organisms detected, and their diversity decreased during spaceflight. Other organisms that had statistically significant changes were <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Fusobacteria</italic> which increased during flight and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> which decreased during flight. At the genus level, <italic>Catonella</italic>, <italic>Megasphera</italic>, and <italic>Actinobacillus</italic> were absent in more than half of saliva samples collected pre-flight but were then detected during flight. In those subjects that already had these genera pre-flight, their relative abundances increased during flight. Correlation analyses between the microbiome and viral titers revealed a positive correlation with <italic>Gracilibacteria</italic>, <italic>Absconditabacteria</italic>, and <italic>Abiotrophia</italic> and a negative correlation between <italic>Oribacterium</italic>, <italic>Veillonella</italic>, and <italic>Haemophilus</italic>. There was also a significant positive correlation between microbiome richness and EBV viral titers.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par3">This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par4">The World Health Organization published a surveillance strategy report in 2015 stating that worldwide, non-infectious disease (NIDs) represented 43% of global disease burden and was expected to be responsible for 60% of the disease burden and 73% of all deaths by 2020s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining 20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, genitourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining health. Changes in the composition of one’s microbiome may promote the development of the aforementioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have different bacterial communities than healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether these microbial differences are a consequence or a cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the latter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], or colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] then go on to develop disease.</p>
              <p id="Par5">The importance of the human microbiome in health promotion is just as relevant to astronauts and perhaps even more so, as medical procedures and facilities are limited during spaceflight. As of 2018, there have been 557 astronauts/cosmonauts that have flown to outer space with well-documented physiological and immunological issues, such as bone loss, muscle atrophy, fatigue, elevated cortisol levels, nausea, skin/urinary tract/upper-respiratory tract infections, and impaired innate/adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, data is still limited on how the human microbiome, which plays an integral role in human health, is impacted by spaceflight and whether changes in the astronaut microbiome contribute to the conditions experienced by many astronauts.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Culture analyses conducted during the Skylab missions suggest that oral microbial populations may change during spaceflight, as increased counts of anaerobic bacteria from intra-oral sites were recorded in-flight compared to pre-flight samples from 18 astronauts studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiome should be examined in detail as imbalances have been implicated in oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immune regulation, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and thus could significantly impact the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight (i.e., manned missions to Mars).</p>
              <p id="Par7">Reactivation of latent herpesviruses has been documented in astronauts for years. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been observed during both short (10–16 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and long (60–180 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] duration ISS missions with longer missions producing higher viral titers and prolonged shedding upon return to Earth (shedding for 30 days post-flight [long duration mission] vs shedding for 5 days post flight [shorter duration]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The impact of EBV shedding, for example, on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect, through immune modulation or directly, through bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV, by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic modifications in the inserted viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">The aim of this study was to examine, for the first time, whether and how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and whether there is a microbiome signature that may be influential in preventing or promoting viral reactivation in humans.

                <p id="Par10">Alpha diversity of the salivary microbiome was assessed with Shannon’s diversity (measure of richness and evenness), Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic difference between the observed sequences), and community richness (number. of observed amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]). All three metrics showed that microbiome diversity and richness increased during spaceflight (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) but then dropped back to pre-flight levels upon return to Earth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Alpha diversity of salivary microbiome. Saliva samples were collected from 10 astronauts at various time points before flying to the ISS (pre-flight), while on the ISS (Flight) and upon return to Earth (post-flight). Diversity was measured using Shannon’s diversity index (left panel) and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (right panel). Richness was measured by counting the number of unique amplicon sequence variants (ASV) within each sample (middle panel). Reads were rarified to different counts (x-axis) and the values for each rarefied read count plotted (y-axis).

For this reason, it was of interest to examine how alpha diversity of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sequences changed as a result of spaceflight. Unlike the collective microbiome, Shannon’s diversity of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was lower in spaceflight samples compared to pre-flight and post-flight samples (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and while diversity did rebound after flight, it did not reach pre-flight values (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). On the other hand, while pre-flight and in-flight samples did not show significant differences in richness (though the number of observed <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sequences did decrease slightly in-flight), there was a significant decrease in the number of streptococcal sequences in samples collected post-flight (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>B).</p>
                <p id="Par12">Beta diversity of the salivary microbiome was also compared. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of the centered log ratio (clr) transformed data did not show any distinct clustering, indicating no overall microbiome differences between subjects and based on flight status (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

For this reason, NMDS ordination was performed for each subject, in order to better understand the impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome. Five out of the 10 subjects clustered based on flight status with pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples all different from each other (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is important to note that different taxa were responsible for the differences based on flight status in these five individuals.

                <title>Viral reactivation</title>
                <p id="Par18">The human microbiome has become a powerful tool to help predict and modulate health and disease. The oral microbiome specifically has been implicated in modulating oral cancer, caries, periodontitis, immunity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, there have been limited studies to date that have explored the possible interplay between the oral microbiome and latent viral reactivation and propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One of the aims of this study was thus to determine whether there was a salivary microbiome signature that could help predict whether an astronaut would be more prone or better protected against EBV, HSV-1, or VZV reactivation. As none of the 89 saliva samples collected were positive for VZV, the analyses presented in this paper are based on EBV (30% of samples positive) and HSV-1 (22% of samples positive).</p>
                <p id="Par19">A positive correlation was found between EBV copy number (qPCR viral data) and bacterial richness (an alpha diversity measure of 16S rRNA observed sequences) which suggests that as the number of bacterial strains increase within a sample, the viral load also increases. In relation to health and disease, high bacterial richness in the saliva has been associated with poor oral health (decayed teeth, periodontitis, and poor oral hygiene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and in the vagina, high bacterial diversity has been linked to bacterial vaginosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is unknown how increased bacterial richness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication, but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abundance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an impact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the additional strains not present in virus negative samples produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii) directly interact with the viral particle to increase propagation, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to properly clear viral particles. To note, there is the possibility that weakening of the astronauts’ immune response during spaceflight facilitates EBV reactivation and the growth of bacterial strains that otherwise would be controlled by the immune response, remaining undetected. While there was a correlation between EBV and the microbiome, none existed for HSV-1. Even though EBV and HSV-1 are both members of the herpesvirus family (<italic>Herpesviridae</italic>), the microbiome-viral interactions may differ and thus varied responses will ensue.</p>
                <p id="Par20">The Spearman’s correlation analysis showed an inverse correlation between EBV copy number and the relative abundances of the genera <italic>Oribacterium</italic>, <italic>Lachnoanaerobaculum</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, <italic>Johnsonella</italic>, and <italic>Stomatobaculum</italic>, which, with the exception of <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, all belong to the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> family. These genera could also accurately predict, as indicated by random forests, whether a saliva sample was positive or negative for viral titers. Since this study showed that a decrease in the relative abundances of these bacteria are associated with higher viral titers, it suggests a protective role of these bacteria in maintaining viral latency and/or inhibiting viral growth once the lytic cycle is switched on.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Members of the genus <italic>Oribacterium</italic> are non-spore forming, gram positive, motile, and strict anaerobes that have been isolated from human subgingival plaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There are very few studies that make reference to it in terms of health and disease, but there is one record of <italic>Oribacterium</italic> being enriched in saliva samples from healthy control subjects compared to saliva from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The major fermentation end product of two of the three species in this genus, which were both found in our dataset, <italic>O. parvum</italic> and <italic>O. sinus</italic>, is lactate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Lactate levels in the saliva could control viral titers once reactivation occurs, as physiological levels of lactic acid present in the vaginal tract have shown potency in HIV and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p>
                <p id="Par22">Lactate also significantly increases the production of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) by <italic>Veillonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

It was also the most predictive organism, as assessed by random forests, for these groups (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>C).

Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a potent inducer of latent viral proteins and shown to induce reactivation of EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], Karposi’s sarcoma virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In a study involving wild-type and H<sub>2</sub>S deficient strains of <italic>E.coli</italic>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> degradation in the cell was severely hampered in the mutant strains compared to the wild-type (H<sub>2</sub>S proficient) strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>S has the ability to antagonize H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effects on the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], scavenge reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], and induce the expression of catalases and peroxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], all leading to lower amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the host.</p>
                <p id="Par23">The ability of <italic>Haemophilus</italic> to utilize H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> could be one of the ways it may protect the host against reactivation. In addition to its aforementioned inverse correlation with viral load and its predictive potential in random forests, <italic>Haemophilus</italic>, like <italic>Veillonella</italic>, had a higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but that came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>B). In a study examining production and utilization of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by salivary bacteria, three species from the <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> group produced high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when grown aerobically (2–9.8 mM) and anaerobically (1.1- 3.9 mM) which was rapidly cleared (within minutes) by <italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> and <italic>H. segnis</italic> (as well as <italic>Neisseria sicca</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>).

                <p id="Par24">There are also bacteria that may play a role in promoting viral reactivation and/or propagation.

It was first described in a study of the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and since then at least 13 clones have been detected from the human oral cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].

                <p id="Par25">While points have been made as to how the bacteria that were predictive or correlative could play a role in preventing or promoting viral reactivation/replication, there is also the possibility that differences observed between the groups were a byproduct of viral reactivation and replication changing the microbiome. A future study with a larger sample size of astronauts that (i) never had viral reactivation, (ii) were always positive for viral titers, and (iii) at some time point experienced latency and at other points experiencing shedding, which could help answer the above question. A larger dataset would also help determine whether a signature microbiome that protects against or promotes reactivation/replication is different depending on whether the astronaut is on Earth or in space.</p>

                <title>Impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome</title>
                <p id="Par27">This study examined how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight. Alpha diversity (richness, Shannon’s diversity, phylogenetic diversity) changed during flight but beta diversity (differences between samples based on what is there and their abundances) did not. While there were no population level differences as a result of spaceflight, 5 out of the 10 subjects did have distinct microbial communities pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. It is interesting to note that for the five subjects that had a significant difference in their microbiome, this was their first space mission, while the five subjects that did not have microbiome differences, had previously flown to the ISS. This may suggest that a person’s microbiome is able to adapt to spaceflight and is less recalcitrant to microbiome effects during spaceflight upon re-exposure. For those five subjects whose microbiome was not impacted by flight, it was evident that their post-flight samples were never similar to the pre-flight samples, even after 6 months, suggesting that the act of flying to the ISS causes either an irreversible change in the oral microbiome or a change that takes longer than 6 months to rebound. Further studies would need to be done to examine the consequence of these changes on the long-term health of the astronaut. Since each subject had different microbes influencing the microbial communities, a focus on a personalized astronaut microbiome to maintain health and prevent disease would be necessary.</p>

              <p id="Par28">This is the first study to look at how the salivary microbiome changes as a result of spaceflight and the search for bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation. Further studies examining the role of specific organisms that were shown to be correlative and predictive in viral reactivation, a serious problem in astronauts during spaceflight, could lead to mitigation strategies to help prevent disease during both short and long duration space missions.</p>

                <p id="Par29">Saliva samples were collected from 10 male astronauts at various time points over the course of their mission. The duration of spaceflight ranged from 2–9 months with an average ISS mission being 4.4 months. Samples were collected (i) two times pre-flight, at 180 days (L-180) and 90 (L-90) days before launch, (ii) three times during flight, at early (1–2 months on ISS) and mid (2–4 months on ISS), and late (10 days before landing) time points and (iii) four times post-flight, on landing day (R + 0), 30 days (R + 30), 60 days (R + 60), and 180 days (R + 180) after return. These time points were adjusted (+/− 30 days) according to the convenience of crew members. The samples were collected by the astronauts themselves by placing a synthetic polymer swab (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) in one’s mouth and swirling it around for 2–3 min until saturation. The samples were stored at − 80 °C until ready to process. Once all samples from a given subject was collected, they were thawed and then centrifuged at ×1400<italic>g</italic> for 5 min to separate the fluid from the swab. The separated fluid was stored at − 80 °C until DNA extraction and the swab discarded.</p>

The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 200 μL PBS. DNA was extracted from this re-suspended pellet with a QIA-Amp DNA kit (Qiagen; Germantown, MD).

                <title>Detection and quantification of EBV, HSV-1, and VZV</title>
                <p id="Par31">Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a TaqMan 7900 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using fluorescence-based amplification. Two microliters of viral DNA was added to 2× TaqMan<sup>TM</sup> Fast Universal PCR master mix (Thermofischer, USA), with primers added to a final concentration of 100 nmol and probes added to a final concentration of 50 nmol. Primer sequences and probes for the herpes viruses (EBV, VZV, and HSV-1) along with the glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) DNA sequences are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Viral DNA standards generated from each herpes virus ranging from 10<sup>0</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> copies/μl were included in all reactions. Reactions were performed in triplicate and were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 s, and 60 °C for 20 s. A sample was considered negative for virus if it had lower than 10 copies of viral DNA.

To summarize, amplicon PCR was performed by adding 2.5ul of 5 ng/ul of DNA to 5 ul of 1uM Forward primer, 5ul of 1uM reverse primer, and 12.5 ul of 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. Forward primer sequences are 5′TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG 3′. Reverse primer sequences are 5′GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC 3′. The PCR condition were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s. A final elongation step was performed at 72 °C for 5 min.</p>
                <p id="Par34">Following quality control and PCR clean up, index PCR was set up with the Nextera XT index kit and a limited-cycle amplification (8 cycles) to attach dual indices and adapters to the amplicons. The library was quantified using Qubit and normalized to 4 nM for all samples, after which all samples were pooled together. The pooled library was loaded onto the sequencer at 6pM with 10% phiX spiked in. The Miseq run utilized the v3 chemistry and 2 × 300 cycle sequencing kit (MS-102-3003). Samples were demultiplexed and adaptors removed using bcl2fastq from Illumina.</p>
