                <p>For deep space exploration, reproductive health must be maintained to preserve the species. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of changes in gravity on male germ cells remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of simulated micro- and hypergravity on mouse sperm motility and the mechanisms of this change. For 1, 3 and 6 h, mouse sperm samples isolated from the caudal epididymis were subjected to simulated microgravity using a random position machine and 2g hypergravity using a centrifuge. The experimental samples were compared with static and dynamic controls. The sperm motility and the percentage of motile sperm were determined using microscopy and video analysis, cell respiration was determined by polarography, the protein content was assessed by Western blotting and the mRNA levels were determined using qRT-PCR. The results indicated that hypergravity conditions led to more significant changes than simulated microgravity conditions: after 1 h, the speed of sperm movement decreased, and after 3 h, the number of motile cells began to decrease. Under the microgravity model, the speed of movement did not change, but the motile spermatozoa decreased after 6 h of exposure. These changes are likely associated with a change in the structure of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and changes in the energy supply are an adaptive reaction to changes in sperm motility.</p>

              <p>During deep space exploration, obtaining healthy offspring of higher animals and maintaining the reproductive health of individuals of different sexes are nontrivial tasks. During the space flight of the Cosmos-1129 biosatellite, effective mating of rats could be achieved, but pregnancy did not occur [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Abortion of preimplantation embryos in mice was also observed [<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In an in vitro experiment, 49 two-cell mouse embryos on board the Columbia Space Shuttle (STS-80) were assessed: none of the embryos developed [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>The reasons for these failures could be related both to the difficulties of conducting an experiment in space flight conditions and to the characteristics of the early embryogenesis of mammals and the maturation of their germ cells. For example, under simulated microgravity conditions by a random positioning machine, a decrease in the survival of mouse follicles was observed with aberrant development of granulosa cells and oocytes, as shown by a reduction in the content of related markers [<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
              <p>Male germ cells represent a specific target for the action of microgravity, as movement and capacitation of these cells are necessary for successful natural fertilization.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the spermatozoa of lower animals (sea urchin) were examined in space experiments as part of the space shuttle expeditions STS-81 (January 1997) and STS-84 (May 1997), and phosphorylation of the phosphothreonine-containing protein FP130 occurred three–four times faster under microgravity conditions than under 1g conditions, indicating more intense activation of sperm motility, since it is associated with a change in phosphorylation level [<xref rid="B5-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p>Storage of mouse sperm at −90 °C on the ISS, where the background radiation is 100 times higher than that at ground level, for nine months led to an increase in DNA damage; however, fertilization and fertility were similar to those of the control group. Sequencing of the next generation showed only slight genomic differences between offspring derived from sperm stored in space and the control sperm, and all offspring grew to maturity and had normal fertility [<xref rid="B6-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
              <p>However, space flight conditions reduce the number of mature spermatozoa in the epididymides, and in model experiments, such as those with antiorthostatic suspension, a significant decrease occurred [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This decrease may be due to the combined action of multiple factors, namely a change in the structural and functional state of the progenitor cells and a change in blood flow in the male genitals. Moreover, it is unlikely that such disorders are due to changes in hormonal status. A study carried out after a six-week antiorthostatic suspension of male rats showed that the testes mass and spermatogenesis were reduced; spermatogenous cells were not observed, with the exception of round spermatids; and accordingly, no mature sperm was observed in the epididymis. Germ cells were also absent in the duct deferens, with the exception of several spermatogonia, which was associated with a change in Sertoli cells. However, the levels of testosterone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone did not change [<xref rid="B9-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>After a 30-day antiorthostatic suspension of mice, we observed various changes in the spermogram of the mice: a decrease in the number of motile spermatozoa, a significant decrease in the proportion of viable sperm and a normal sperm morphology. According to the data on the sperm-specific protein levels, there was a shift towards immature forms, as well as various changes in the content of cytoskeletal proteins and the expression of the corresponding genes [<xref rid="B10-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Thus, microgravity conditions lead to multiple structural and functional changes in native germ cells, especially male germ cells. However, the pathogenesis of the changes in response to a mechanical stimulus remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the sperm motility of mice during their short-term cultivation in altered mechanical conditions: simulated microgravity and hypergravity (2g).</p>

                <title>2.1. Sperm Motility</title>
                <p>Cultivation of sperm in the medium led to a decrease in the number of motile spermatozoa and a decrease in the speed of movement in the static control group relative to the zero control group. The proportion of motile spermatozoa was 29 ± 4% in the CS1 group, 31.0 ± 2.8% in the CS3 group, 19.9 ± 2.0% in the CS6 group and 48 ± 4% in the CS0 group (histogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05054-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The speed of movement after 1 and 3 h did not significantly differ from that at the zero point (CS1, 109.5 ± 2.4 μm/s; CS3, 103 ± 3 μm/s; compared to 117 ± 3 μm/s in CS0). After 6 h, the speed significantly decreased by 32% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and was 79 ± 5 μm/s in the CS6 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05054-f001">Figure 1</xref>, graph). The motility parameters in the dynamic control groups did not differ from those in the corresponding static control groups; therefore, the motility parameters in the s-μg and 2g groups were compared with those in the corresponding static control groups.</p>
                <p>Exposure under the simulated microgravity conditions led to significant changes in the portion of motile spermatozoa after 6 h: it decreased almost two times compared with that of the corresponding control (histogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05054-f001">Figure 1</xref>), although the speed did not change (graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05054-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Cultivation in hypergravity conditions led to a decrease in the speed of sperm movement by 29% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) relative to that of the corresponding control group at 1 h (78.2 ± 2.3 μm/s vs. 109.5 ± 2.4 μm/s), and the absolute values of speed in the group with hypergravity exposure did not change. Against the background of a decrease in speed in the control groups during cultivation, after 6 h, the speed of movement in the 2g6 and CS6 groups did not differ from each other (graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05054-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The proportion of motile spermatozoa under hypergravity decreased relative to that of the control after 3 h of exposure and remained at the same level after 6 h (histogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05054-f001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

              <p>Analysis of the regulation of sperm motility in mammals under changing external mechanical conditions is important to prevent possible future reproductive problems after or during long-term space missions. The mechanism of triggering various changes at the cellular level in zero gravity is still obscure. Therefore, in this work, using an increase and decrease in external mechanical stress, we analyzed the mechanisms underlying the changes in the motility of mouse sperm.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that simulated microgravity is not real microgravity. The principle of the random positioning machine is that there is a change in the orientation of the cells relative to gravity in such a way that the superposition of the vectors per minute is equal to zero on average. The fundamental difference with real weightlessness lies in such an alternating impact. However, it should be noted that even in a real space flight, at least in low Earth orbit, it is almost impossible to achieve zero gravity due to a number of technogenic factors, for example, turning on the engines on the ISS to correct the orbit. Moreover, short-term experiments aimed at identifying the mechanisms of cell signaling in real space flight are extremely difficult. Therefore, by far the most widely used method is simulated microgravity.</p>
              <p>Changes in sperm motility were more pronounced under hypergravity than under microgravity, which is consistent with data obtained on human sperm in parabolic flights [<xref rid="B11-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A decrease in speed under 2g conditions was observed after 1 h, and after 3 h, the number of motile cells begins to decrease. Moreover, under the conditions of simulated microgravity, the speed of movement relative to that of the corresponding controls did not change, but the number of motile spermatozoa significantly decreased after 6 h.</p>
              <p>The motor activity of sperm is determined by the state of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which provides motility, and its energy supply. Previous studies showed that a decrease in the mechanical load on skeletal muscle cells leads to a decrease in the efficiency of cell respiration [<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and an increase in the volume mechanical load, particularly on cardiomyocytes, to an increase in the rate of energy production [<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the observed changes in motility may be associated with changes in cell respiration.</p>
              <p>Surprisingly, we did not find changes in the rate of cellular respiration after 1 h of hypergravity conditions, and after 3 h, the respiration rate in the 2g group was significantly higher than that in the control. Inhibitor analysis indicated that this increase was due to the increased efficiency of complex I of the respiratory chain since when it was inhibited and substrate II of the complex was then added, the rates did not differ from that of the control. It should be noted that an increase in the activity of complex I of the respiratory chain could lead to the accumulation of ROS. As a result of electron leakage of the respiratory chain, a significant amount of ROS is formed as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation. The main contribution is made by the I and III complexes of the respiratory chain, during which electron leakage leads to the reduction of oxygen to superoxide-ion [<xref rid="B17-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Under normal conditions, superoxide is rapidly transformed into hydrogen peroxide due to the work of superoxide dismutase, and then it can be reduced to water by catalase or glutathione peroxidase [<xref rid="B18-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is well known that when preparing sperm for in vitro fertilization protocols, semen is separated by centrifugation. It was shown that a significant accumulation of ROS occurs in this case, which correlates with time and applied acceleration [<xref rid="B19-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, it should be noted, that the minimum value used in these protocols is 100 times higher than 2g. Nevertheless, a similar, albeit not so significant, effect cannot be ruled out. However, even this effect does not explain the increase in the rate of cellular respiration after 3 h against the background of a decrease in mobility, which was observed after 1 h.</p>
              <p>A decrease in motility leads to a decrease in ATP consumption and, logically, should lead to a decrease in respiratory rate. However, the energy supply of sperm is mainly due to glycolysis [<xref rid="B24-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At the early stages of adaptation to hypergravity conditions, transient ATP accumulation may occur due to a decrease in its utilization, and then, the Pasteur effect occurs: suppression of phosphofructokinase activity under the accumulation of ATP and a switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation; as a result, the rate of oxygen consumption is increased. Further, up to 6 h, the expected decrease in the rate of cell respiration occurred, both under conditions of hypergravity and simulated microgravity. Moreover, a decrease in the content of one of the key proteins of the respiratory chain, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, was observed in the s-μg and 2g groups: this decrease is most likely due to its proteolysis, since the mRNA level did not change. Thus, given the results of cell respiration analysis, it is likely that the observed changes are an adaptation of the sperm energy supply system to a new regime of motor activity but not its cause. However, in analyses of cardiomyocytes, the intensity of cell respiration was shown to depend on the state of the cytoskeleton [<xref rid="B25-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], as well as cell motility. Therefore, we further analyzed the content of proteins related to the microtubule cytoskeleton.</p>
              <p>After 1 h of exposure under hypergravity conditions, the relative content of beta-tubulin, which is one of the subunits of the tubulin heterodimer of microtubules, decreased, and after 3 h, the content of the second subunit, alpha-tubulin, began to decrease. Notably, the decrease in the content of cytoskeletal proteins, as well as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, is due to proteolysis since the content of the corresponding mRNA decreased later than the protein content. In the case of the accumulation of tubulin subunits, in contrast to the assembly of microtubules, their degradation may begin and subsequently affect the translation process, as well as the content of the corresponding mRNA [<xref rid="B26-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the content of chaperonin containing Tcp1, subunit 4 (delta) Cct4, which ensures the assembly of newly synthesized tubulin alpha and beta subunits into heterodimers in the presence of magnesium ions and ATP [<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], did not change throughout the entire exposure period. However, after 6 h, the relative content of the cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 Ckap5, which binds microtubules to each other and binds to the plus end, preventing their destruction [<xref rid="B29-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], decreased.</p>
              <p>The beta-tubulin content also decreased under simulated microgravity conditions but only after 6 h, when a decrease in the number of motile spermatozoa occurs. Microtubule networking is a gravitationally dependent process [<xref rid="B30-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the issue of microtubule assembly under these conditions is still unclear. According to some reports, self-assembly of tubulin into microtubules occurs regardless of gravity [<xref rid="B35-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, another report showed that after 10 days of cultivation of mesenchymal stem cells under simulated microgravity conditions, the polymerization activity of tubulin was not changed, but after three days, the authors observed decomposition of microtubules [<xref rid="B37-ijms-21-05054" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that a decrease in the content of at least one of the components of the tubulin heterodimer forming the flagella axoneme will naturally lead to a change in sperm motility.</p>
              <p>The results obtained indicate that even a very short exposure under altered mechanical conditions leads to changes in sperm, which, with longer exposure, will probably become more pronounced. On the one hand, this will make it possible to visualize, for example, the destruction of the cytoskeleton structure by staining in order to localize the changes. On the other hand, the number of factors acting inside the cell will increase. For example, oxidative stress and ROS accumulation can also lead to structural changes. In general, probable oxidative stress and destruction of the cytoskeleton can affect the fertilizing ability, which makes these changes critical for fertilization and early development, and during a long space flight—for maintaining the species. In addition, the influence of other factors of space exploration, especially beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere, such as radiation and hypomagnetic conditions, can also lead to negative consequences for reproductive function and requires further study.</p>

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>The results obtained indicate that with brief changes in external mechanical stress, a decrease in the motor activity of mouse sperm occurs. In hypergravity conditions, after 1 h, the speed of movement decreases, as does the proportion of motile spermatozoa; in simulated microgravity conditions, after 6 h, the number of motile spermatozoa decreases. These changes in motility are associated with a change in the structure of the cytoskeleton and a decrease in the tubulin content. Changes in cellular respiration are probably an adaptive reaction to a change in the mode of motor activity.</p>
              <p>Limitations of the study are associated with the inability to conduct research under exposure in simulated microgravity and hypergravity. Estimation of the cell respiration was carried out practically in the early period of readaptation, in 1g conditions, after simulated microgravity and hypergravity. In addition, to isolate proteins and mRNA, we froze sperm cells, which were previously briefly centrifuged. Of course, all samples, including the corresponding controls, were prepared identically, which makes it possible to study the effect of exposure, however, it would be better to carry out measurements under exposure conditions.</p>
