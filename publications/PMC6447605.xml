                <p id="Par1">Many pivotal biological cell processes are affected by gravity. The aim of our study was to evaluate biological and functional effects, differentiation potential and exo-metabolome profile of simulated microgravity (SMG) on human hepatic cell line (HepG2) and human biliary tree stem/progenitor cells (hBTSCs). Both hBTSCs and HepG2 were cultured in a weightless and protected environment SGM produced by the Rotary Cell Culture System (Synthecon) and control condition in normal gravity (NG). Self-replication and differentiation toward mature cells were determined by culturing hBTSCs in Kubota’s Medium (KM) and in hormonally defined medium (HDM) tailored for hepatocyte differentiation. The effects on the expression and cell exo-metabolome profiles of SMG versus NG cultures were analyzed. SMG promotes tridimensional (3D) cultures of hBTSCs and HepG2. Significative increase of stemness gene expression (p &lt; 0.05) has been observed in hBTSCs cultured in SMG when compared to NG condition. At the same time, the expression of hepatocyte lineage markers in hBTSCs differentiated by HDM was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in SMG compared to NG, demonstrating an impaired capability of hBTSCs to differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> toward mature hepatocytes when cultured in SMG condition. Furthermore, in HepG2 cells the SMG caused a lower (p &lt; 0.05 vs controls) transcription of CYP3A4, a marker of late-stage (i.e. Zone 3) hepatocytes. Exo-metabolome NMR-analysis showed that both cell cultures consumed a higher amount of glucose and lower glutamate in SMG respect to NG (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, hBTSCs media cultures resulted richer of released fermentation (lactate, acetate) and ketogenesis products (B-hydroxybutyrate) in SGM (p &lt; 0.05) than NG. While, HepG2 cells showed higher consumption of amino acids and release of ketoacids (3-Methyl-2-oxovalerate, 2-oxo-4-methyl-valerate) and formiate with respect to normogravity condition (p &lt; 0.05). Based on our results, SMG could be helpful for developing hBTSCs-derived liver devices. In conclusion, SMG favored the formation of hBTSCs and HepG2 3D cultures and the maintenance of stemness contrasting cell differentiation; these effects being associated with stimulation of glycolytic metabolism. Interestingly, the impact of SMG on stem cell biology should be taken into consideration for workers involved in space medicine programs.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Gravity exerts a remarkable impact on cell biology, especially on metabolism and cytoskeleton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Indeed, SMG has been proved to profoundly influence both function and phenotypic determination of mature and stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> since in absence of proper physical constraints, cells are unable to find a unique, specific differentiated fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Exposure of embryonic stem cells (ES) to SMG for 15 days blocked cell differentiation with ES ‘frozen’ into a pluripotent phenotype and their gene-expression pattern (Sox1 and Sox2) was similar to control ES at the very early stages of development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, human bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) have been shown to largely remain in an undifferentiated state after exposure to SMG for three days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or are reverted to a pluripotent state when committed towards differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, SMG hinders the differentiating pathways in BMSC with reduction of osteogenic marker expression and incomplete maturation of the bone microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, eventually driving cells towards unexpected cell fate specification (i.e., adipocyte fate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. SMG delayed also hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) differentiation into committed progenitor cells when HSC are exposed to weightlessness for longer periods (11 days)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Even cancer stem cells can be ‘arrested’ in their phenotypic differentiating pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> by SMG that also may induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as observed in human keratinocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In substance a robust scientific background suggests that gravity represents a key regulator of the cell destiny.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Liver is the main metabolic organ of the organism and it is conceivably vulnerable to space-derived lesions or dysfunctions. A population of stem cells, the <italic>human biliary tree stem/progenitor cells</italic> (hBTSCs), was identified at the bottom of peribiliary glands (PBG), with a great concentration into the common hepatic duct, cystic duct, hepatopancreatic ampulla. hBTSCs progressively lose their molecular characteristics and phenotype at the lumen surface, assuming mature features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These cells express endodermal stem markers (OCT4, Nanog, EpCAM, LGR5, SOX9, SOX17, PDX1) and they can differentiate <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in mature hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and pancreatic islets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. hBTSCs were demonstrated to be a valid vehicle for regenerative medicine because their features and availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this study we evaluated the effects of SMG on biological properties and functions of cultured human hepatic and biliary tree stem/progenitor cells, on their differentiation potential and exo-metabolome profile, to evaluate whether SMG may help the development of tridimensional cultures of human biliary tree stem cells (hBTSCs), to be used for the regenerative medicine of liver diseases and for development of liver devices.</p>

                <p id="Par5">The expression of stem cell genes (OCT4, SOX2, SOX17, PDX1) was tested in hBTSCs and HepG2 cells cultured with Cytodex 3 microbeads in SMG and in NG condition and in either Kubota’s Medium (KM) or hormonally defined medium (HDM). In NG condition, the expression of the stem cell genes OCT4, SOX2, SOX17, and PDX1 resulted markedly reduced (25 folds for OCT4; 9 folds for SOX2; 7.7 folds for SOX17; 6.7 folds for PDX1) after 15 days in HDM in comparison with hBTSCs maintained in KM (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In contrast, in cells cultured for 15 days in SMG, the expression of stem cell genes was preserved or even increased (an increase of 26.17 folds for OCT4; 13.37 folds for SOX2; 27.73 folds for SOX17; 17.24 folds for PDX1) after culture in HDM than in KM (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In sum, SMG maintained hBTSCs in an undifferentiated state even when they were incubated in HDM medium that normally induced differentiation toward mature hepatocytes in NG.

                <p id="Par6">In order to achieve semi-quantitative data on the protein expression of the modulated genes, cells were removed from the vessels and smeared on slides to perform immunofluorescence analysis. Because of this technical aspect, cell cultures did not retain their 3D organization, which did not reflect the appearance of the colony under microgravity. However, the immunofluorescence analysis confirmed in NG condition the reduced expression of stem cells markers (Oct4A, Sox2, Pdx1) (p &lt; 0.05) and the increased expression of mature markers (Alb, Mrp2) (p &lt; 0.05) in hBTSCs maintained in HDM than cells under self-replication condition (KM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

For HepG2 cells low or null expression of stem cell genes, such as OCT4 and SOX17, were detected as expected in NG. Interestingly, we observed a significant increased expression of these stem cell genes in SMG (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). Furthermore, SMG, compared to NG, stimulated ALB gene expression in HepG2 cells (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), and the reduction of the expression of CYP3A4 gene, a marker of late-stage (i.e. Zone 3) hepatocytes (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>).

                <p id="Par9">Starting from 3 days in culture, significant metabolic differences were observed in hBTSCs in KM than in HDM media, Specifically, on the principal component 1 or PC1 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005) that is the linear combination of the starting variables with the maximum variance; while on the principal component 2 or PC2, the linear combination of the variables with the immediately inferior variance and orthogonal to PC1, it was possible to observe only significant differences between cells grown in NG or SMG condition (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>).</p>
                <p id="Par10">With the increase of experimental time, the metabolic effects due to SMG condition became more evident: we observed differences between samples from SMG cells and their control cells in NG condition at day 8 on PC2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) (not showed) and at day 13 on PC1 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00001) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Moreover, at day 13, we observed metabolic differences between medium samples from cells cultured in KM or HDM only in NG condition. Then, to identify the metabolites that best contribute to the discrimination between samples from SMG cells and their control cells in NG condition at day 13 on PC1, we analyzed the loadings values from PCA with a threshold of 0.95 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). PC1 included the following variables with the highest correlation levels: beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, alanine, acetate, glutamate, pyruvate and glucose. Therefore, considering the net balance of these metabolites (i.e. the difference between all the bins of the spectra acquired at day 13 and the corresponding averaged bins of the spectra at 0 hours), PC1 indicated that the SMG induced a lower consumption of glutamate and pyruvate as well as a higher consumption of glucose. Moreover, the cells in SMG condition increased the production of beta-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, alanine and acetate. Thus, the SMG increased the glycolytic phenotype of hBTSCs.</p>
                <p id="Par11">The analysis of HepG2 culture medium evidenced an analogue difference between the metabolism dependent on NG/SMG condition: we observed significant metabolic differences between cells cultured in NG (both adherent and Cytodex 3 cultures) or SMG condition on PC1 at each experimental time (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.00001) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c,d</xref>).

              <p id="Par12">SMG favors the development of tridimensional cultures of hBTSCs and HepG2. Indeed, hBTSCs and HepG2 were able to grow in SMG adhering to the surface of Cytodex 3 where large and wide cell clusters were formed into a higher extent than in traditional bi-dimensional plated cultures.</p>
              <p id="Par13">SMG stimulated cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and that facilitated the formation of tridimensional clusters, in association with favoured cell proliferation. Interestingly, different cell lineages growing in microgravity undergo a spontaneous transition leading to the emergence of two distinct phenotypes, while, the return in a normal gravitational field, the two phenotypes collapse, recovering their original configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. It has been hypothesized that, once the gravitational constraint is removed, the system freely explores its phenotypic space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The optimized 3D growth observed in the simulated microgravity in hBTSCs and HepG2 is in agreement with the theory of the lack of the gravitational constraint. The improvement of SMG-associated cultures could allow the maintaining of vital tissues and organ sections to be potentially destined to clinical therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par14">Furthermore, our study demonstrated an important impact of SMG on both gene and protein expression and metabolome in hBTSCs and HepG2 cells. Gene expression and protein analysis suggested a role of SMG in maintaining stemness and counteracting cell differentiation, while, exo-metabolomic analysis demonstrated a role of SMG in stimulating a glycolytic metabolism. Indeed, when hBTSCs were cultured in HDM, that should induce differentiation toward mature hepatocytes, stemness was maintained by SMG as demonstrated by cell morphology and both gene and protein expression analyses.</p>
              <p id="Par15">Interestingly, SMG-induced maintenance of stemness was associated with a predominant glycolytic metabolism in hBTSCs. These effects of SMG were not cell-specific since were also observed in HepG2 cells, where SMG reduced the expression of CYP3A4, a marker of late-stage (i.e. Zone 3) hepatocytes. Interestingly, at both gene and protein level expression, in SMG it has been revealed the expression of a pluripotency marker, such as Oct4a, in HepG2 cells. As far as albumin expression, it is noteworthy that the gene and protein expression analysis showed an opposite trend. Indeed, while albumin is expressed in NG, as expected, and reduced in SMG, the albumin gene resulted highly transcribed in SMG vs NG. This apparent discordance may be explained by the significance of the albumin itself, which is an early-stage hepatocyte gene, and thus expressed solely as mRNA by hepatic/stem progenitor cells or hepatoblasts, while stably expressed as protein in mature hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, the phenotype of HepG2 in SMG is consistent with the one of hepatic/stem progenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Finally, also in HepG2 cells transcriptomic modulation exerted by SMG is associated with the induction of a glycolytic metabolism. This was demonstrated by the analysis of the metabolic loading, by NMR spectra, performed in either hBTSCs or HepG2 cells under SMG, irrespectively from the culture media.</p>
              <p id="Par16">Different studies showed that pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells is associated with polyunsaturated metabolome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Notably, glycolytic cell metabolism and the resulting metabolome have been associated with stemness and pluripotency in human pluripotent stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> while the differentiation processes, associated with maturation of the mitochondrial network, were characterized by a metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. It is of interest that a glycolytic metabolism in aerobic condition is typical of tumour cells, and this is known as “Warburg Effect”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In keeping, CCA primary cell lines, the neoplastic counterpart of biliary epithelium characterized by high representation of cancer stem cells showed a metabolic profile similar to hBTSCs maintained in SMG condition (data not shown).</p>
              <p id="Par17">A point of high relevance for 3D structures has been noted and concerns the experience of oxygen and nutrients gradients in 3D strictures, with decreasing values from the outer surface to the inner core of the cell cluster. Notably, the system adopted here was the object of a deep study of the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients into the rotating vessel by Ayyaswamy P.S. &amp; Mukundakrishnan K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Authors demonstrated that the environment created within the vessel during the experiment is characterized by a stable diffusion of O2 and nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In our paper, to confirm the lack of a metabolic sufferance of 3D aggregates keep in cultures under microgravity we have analyzed the supernatant of the vessel and compared data on glucose consumption with the same cells keep in normogravity, which showed that the level of glucose in the supernatant of hBTSCs growth under microgravity as 3D organoids or in that of hBTSCs growth in normogravity in standard cell culture system do not differ each other. Although these data would exclude that the observed changes in gene expression and metabolism may depend on oxygen and nutrients availability, rather than by microgravity alone, further studies should be performed, e.g. using cells cultured in dynamic conditions using a microfluidic device.</p>
              <p id="Par18">Previously, it has been demonstrated that the SMG induces a decreased in the activity and/or gene expression of enzymes involved in oxidative energy production in muscles, while, in contrast, glycolytic metabolism seemed to be slightly increased in human adult subjected to experimental conditions, mimicking long term MG by resting in 6° head-down tilt position for 84 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par19">The transduction of the gravity signal on which its biologic effects rely on is currently under investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Extracellular mechanic stimuli, capable to modulate cell metabolism and mitochondria, have been described primarily in plant cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this contest the sensorial apparatus has been identified in membrane receptors, cytoskeletal, and intracellular messengers linked to the modulation of metabolic enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) a member of the basic-helix/loop/helix per-Arnt-sim (bHLH/PAS) family of “sensors” of foreign and endogenous signals, has been implicated in gravity sensation. Interestingly, its stimulation up-regulated cytochrome P450 family 1 (CYP1) and another enzyme activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The absence or reduction of gravity may downregulate the AHR mediated metabolic enzyme activation. Our paper warrants future investigations to unveil the mechanisms which link the SMG to metabolome modulation in human cells, especially in stem cells, which are naturally highly sensitive to metabolomic changes.</p>
              <p id="Par20">In conclusions, our results could be implemented by developing SMG-based platforms for scale production of large number of hBTSCs which in turn can found applications for <italic>in vitro</italic> texting and modelling (e.g. liver toxicity tests), regenerative medicine of liver, or production of large amount multipotent stem cell population. Finally, the effects of microgravity on stem cell biology in subjects working in this condition should be contemplated in space medicine programs due the demonstrated impact of SMG on liver health. To this latter regard, results of this paper constitute the basis to develop further studies and technologies where hBTSCs maintained in SMG will be investigated to identify mechanisms and putative therapeutic targets to modulate stem cell differentiation.</p>

These were collected into 16 k data points using spectral widths of 6 kHz in F2 and 40 Hz in F1. There was a 2.0 s relaxation delay. Each FID was Fourier transformed after a multiplication with sine-bell/exponential function in the F2 dimension and a sine-bell function in the F1 dimension. JRES spectra were tilted by 45°, symmetrised about F1, referenced to TSP at dH = 0.0 ppm and the proton-decoupled skyline projections (p-JRES) exported using Agilent VNMRJ 3.2 software. Metabolites responsible for the separation between samples from cells cultured in SMG or NG condition were identified using an in-house NMR database and Chenomx NMR suite v. 7.7 (Chenomx Inc., Alberta, Canada).</p>
