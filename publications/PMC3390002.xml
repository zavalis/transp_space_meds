                <p>How microgravitational space environments affect aging is not well understood. We observed that, in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> spaceflight suppressed the formation of transgenically expressed polyglutamine aggregates, which normally accumulate with increasing age. Moreover, the inactivation of each of seven genes that were down-regulated in space extended lifespan on the ground. These genes encode proteins that are likely related to neuronal or endocrine signaling: acetylcholine receptor, acetylcholine transporter, choline acetyltransferase, rhodopsin-like receptor, glutamate-gated chloride channel, shaker family of potassium channel, and insulin-like peptide. Most of them mediated lifespan control through the key longevity-regulating transcription factors DAF-16 or SKN-1 or through dietary-restriction signaling, singly or in combination. These results suggest that aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is slowed through neuronal and endocrine response to space environmental cues.</p>

          <body>
            <p>Lifespan and aging rate in metazoans are influenced by environmental factors, including temperature<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, oxygen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, pheromone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and food intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Accordingly, perturbation of sensory perception or signaling of mechanical, chemical, or osmotic stimuli changes the lifespan of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Microgravity has been shown to induce several physiological or pathological changes including disturbance of the sense of equilibrium and loss of muscle and bone mass, mainly from the observations in spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. However, how microgravity affects organismal aging and lifespan has not been well understood. This issue is not only intriguing from a basic scientific perspective but also important from a space medical aspect, because the duration of space missions will be increasing such as those for human exploration of other planets or colonization of the moon. To obtain some basic insights into aging in space, we examined an aging marker in space-flown <italic>C. elegans</italic> and explored the involvement of the genes whose expression was changed during spaceflight, in the control of lifespan.</p>
            <sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results">
              <title>Results</title>
              <p>During the International <italic>C. elegans</italic> Experiment First (ICE 1st) project<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, we investigated the effect of spaceflight on the formation of aggregates of a 35-glutamine repeat (Q35) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> transgenically expressing the (CAG)<sub>35</sub>-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) gene in muscle, which normally increases with advancing age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Q35 aggregate formation expressed as the number of aggregates per worm was found to be lower in worms flown in space from the L1 larva stage and L4/young adult stage than in matched ground control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). This difference may be because of the possible changes in growth rate induced by spaceflight. However, growth of worms has been reported to be unaffected by spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Moreover, the number of aggregates per body length was lower in space-flown worms than in ground control worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2D, E</xref>). This indicated that the spaceflight-induced suppression of Q35 aggregates was not ascribed to the spaceflight-induced changes in growth rate. Numbers of Q35 aggregates per total YFP fluorescence intensity in each worm, an indicator of Q35 expression, was also lowered by spaceflight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). This showed that the spaceflight-induced suppression of Q35 aggregates was not due to spaceflight-induced changes in Q35 expression. These results suggest that biomarkers of aging are expressed more slowly in space-flown <italic>C. elegans</italic> in than ground control worms.</p>
              <p>Further, these findings led us to propose a working hypothesis that the space environment changes the expression of genes involved in the control of aging. To identify the possible longevity-control genes, we first used the data from a DNA microarray experiment conducted to examine changes in gene expression in response to spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> (The data set was deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number: GSE36358) and WormBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>.)), which showed that the expression of 48 genes increased by more than two-fold, and that of 199 genes decreased to less than half in the spaceflight conditions relative to the ground control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Among these genes, we noticed that eleven genes likely related to neuronal or endocrine signaling were down-regulated in space-flown worms. We confirmed these observations and quantitatively evaluated the extent of decreased mRNA expression using real-time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Second, we examined the effects of the inactivation of these eleven genes by loss- or reduction-of-function mutations and/or feeding RNA interference (RNAi) on the lifespan under ground laboratory conditions. We found that the inactivation of each of seven genes among these eleven genes extended lifespan on NGM agar covered with killed or live bacteria as food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 online</xref>). These included <italic>gar-3</italic>, acetylcholine receptor; <italic>unc-17</italic>, acetylcholine transporter; <italic>cha-1</italic>, choline acetyltransferase; F57A8.4, rhodopsin-like G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR); <italic>glc-4</italic>, glutamate-gated chloride channel; <italic>shk-1</italic>, shaker family of potassium channel; and <italic>ins-35</italic>, insulin-like peptide. We also ascertained whether these lifespan extensions could be seen in the liquid culture medium (CeMM) that had been used to culture worms in the spaceflight experiment. The mutations in all of these genes, except <italic>unc-17(e245)</italic> whose lifespan could not be assessed because it could not grow in CeMM for presently unknown reasons, were also found to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
              <p>To further explore the mechanism of lifespan extension by the inactivation of each of these genes, we investigated whether lifespan extensions are mediated through the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, which is a key factor in lifespan extension by reduction of insulin/IGF-1 like signaling (IIS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, or through SKN-1, an Nrf-like xenobiotic-response factor, which is the other key factor in lifespan extension both by reduction of IIS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and by dietary-restriction signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Lifespan extensions caused by mutations either in <italic>ins-35, glc-4, unc-17,</italic> or <italic>shk-1</italic> were totally abolished by <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi inactivation, whereas mutations either in <italic>gar-3</italic>, F57A8.4, or <italic>cha-1</italic> still lived longer than wild-type worms under <italic>daf-16</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S2 online</xref>). These results suggest that INS-35, GLC-4, UNC-17, and SHK-1 control lifespan thorough IIS/DAF-16 signaling. Further, the <italic>skn-1</italic> RNAi completely abolished the lifespan extension induced by mutations in <italic>ins-35, glc-4,</italic> and <italic>shk-1,</italic> whereas mutants in <italic>unc-17, gar-3,</italic> F57A8.4, and <italic>cha-1</italic> still lived longer than wild-type worms under <italic>skn-1</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S2 online</xref>). These results suggest that INS-35, GLC-4, and SHK-1 control lifespan through SKN-1. To determine whether these lifespan extensions are mediated through dietary-restriction signaling, we examined the lifespan under the inactivation of <italic>eat-2</italic>, which induces feeding impairment-based dietary restriction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. The <italic>eat-2</italic> RNAi further enhanced the extension of lifespan by mutations in <italic>ins-35, glc-4, unc-17,</italic> or <italic>gar-3,</italic> whereas the <italic>eat-2</italic> RNAi shortened the lifespan of mutants of <italic>shk-1, cha-1,</italic> or F57A8.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S2 online</xref>). These results suggest that SHK-1, CHA-1, and the F57A8.4 protein share a common lifespan control mechanism with dietary-restriction signaling.</p>
              <p>In order to explore the involvement of these seven genes in the suppression of Q35 aggregate formation during spaceflight, we examined the effect of RNAi inactivation of some of these genes on Q35 aggregation. RNAi inactivation of <italic>gar-3</italic>, <italic>cha-1,</italic> and <italic>shk-1</italic> reduced Q35 aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that GAR-3, CHA-1, and SHK-1 control Q35 aggregate formation.</p>
              <p>We investigated whether these seven genes relate to the formation of dauer larvae, a long-lived growth arrest state under harsh environmental conditions.

              <p>We identified seven genes, which were down-regulated in space and whose inactivation extended lifespan under ground conditions. These genes encode proteins that are conserved across animal phylogeny and that are likely related to neuronal or endocrine signaling. How do these genes play a role in longevity control? One possibility is that they are involved in longevity control through sensory perception or signaling of space environmental cues. Mutations that cause defects in sensory perception and signaling systems, related to mechanical, chemical, thermal, and osmotic stimuli and pheromones, have been reported to extend the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. SHK-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> and GLC-4<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> are expressed in sensory neurons and UNC-17 in interneurons in sensory signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. F57A8.4 encodes a homolog of rhodopsin that is known to sense light<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, suggesting that it may be involved in sensing stimuli in space environments. Pheromone-induced dauer formation was inhibited by the inactivation of <italic>unc-17</italic>, <italic>glc-4,</italic> or F57A8.4 and enhanced by that of <italic>ins-35</italic> or <italic>shk-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A, B</xref>), suggesting that some of these genes are involved in lifespan control through sensory perception or signaling processes overlapping with dauer-switching processes. Alternatively, it may be possible that the inactivation of <italic>ins-35</italic> or <italic>shk-1</italic> extends lifespan, as some abnormally efficient dauer formation mutants such as <italic>daf-2</italic> display adult-lifespan extension, and it has been hypothesized that these mutants ectopically express a dauer-related efficient life maintenance capability in the adult stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Meanwhile, <italic>ins-35</italic> is likely involved in endocrine signaling in the control of dauer formation and lifespan, as some of the 40 insulin-like peptides participate in regulating dauer formation and lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through a cell-nonautonomous mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The inactivation of <italic>ins-35</italic> as well as <italic>glc-4</italic> and <italic>shk-1</italic> extended lifespan through the DAF-16 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Reduction in IIS is known to extend lifespan through DAF-16<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> similar to some sensory signaling mutants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Together with the observation that the space environments and IIS reduction shared some common features in terms of their effects on gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and that a hypergravity environment induces DAF-16 localization to nuclei we suggest that DAF-16 also mediates responses to altered gravity levels (the hypergravity experiment used <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as food instead of CeMM<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). On the other hand, the lifespan extension by the inactivation of <italic>glc-4</italic>, <italic>ins-35</italic>, <italic>shk-1,</italic> or <italic>cha-1</italic> required SKN-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). SKN-1 in sensory neurons was reported to mediate lifespan determination during dietary-restriction signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, although SKN-1 in intestine also plays a role in lifespan determination through IIS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p>
              <p>A second possibility is that the genes in the present study are involved in longevity control through motor neuron-muscle signaling. SHK-1 functions in muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and is expressed in neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. CHA-1 and UNC-17, which are expressed in motor neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and GAR-3, which is expressed in motor neurons and muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, play roles in acetylcholine transmission in motor neuron-muscle signaling. <italic>cha-1</italic> and <italic>unc-17</italic> are encoded by a single polycistronic cluster. They share the first noncoding exon; therefore, a common promoter termed as “cholinergic promoter” regulates the expression of both genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Increased acetylcholine signaling enhanced polyglutamine aggregation in post-synaptic muscle cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that excess neuronal stimuli disrupt a balance in protein homeostasis in the target muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Conversely, reduction in neuromuscular signaling may enhance protein structure stabilization, which has been reported to be associated with the enhancement of longevity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Consistent with these studies, several mutations and RNAi treatments recently predicted to disrupt depolarization of the muscle membrane have been shown to alter protein homeostasis within muscle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In fact, the inactivation of <italic>gar-3</italic>, <italic>cha-1,</italic> and <italic>shk-1</italic> suppressed Q35 aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>), suggesting that GAR-3, CHA-1, and SHK-1 play a role in protein structure stability in muscle during motor neuron-muscle signaling. In case of <italic>cha-1</italic>, it has been shown that loss-of-function mutants evoke muscle protein degradation, which is suppressed by inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasome activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. PolyQ aggregation was also reported to be regulated by genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. These neuromuscular signaling changes may affect the muscle protein metabolism observed during spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Alternatively, the possibility remains that SHK-1, which is expressed in sensory neurons<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, controls polyQ aggregation through a mechanism such as thermosensory neuronal circuit nonautonoumously modulates protein misfolding in muscle and intestine cells via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dense core vesicle neurosecretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dense core vesicle neurosecretion mechanism modulates the HSP-70 levels in muscle to affect polyQ aggregation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, and HSP-70 levels are elevated in response to spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. In either case, the suppression of Q35 aggregation observed in space might be explained in part by reduced expression of <italic>gar-3</italic>, <italic>cha-1,</italic> and/or <italic>shk-1</italic>. Given that polyglutamine aggregation is considered to be regulated by protein synthesis, degradation, or transport<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, it seems likely that reduction of <italic>gar-3</italic>, <italic>cha-1</italic>, and/or <italic>shk-1</italic> affect proteostasis in muscle; this also may partially account for the decreased expression of muscle proteins during spaceflight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p>
              <p>Lifespan extension by <italic>eat-2</italic> inactivation inducing the dietary-restriction state<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> was totally abolished by the inactivation of either <italic>cha-1</italic>, <italic>shk-1</italic> or F57A8.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting that CHA-1, SHK-1, or F57A8.4 protein function in processes related to sensory perception of food or signaling in response to food. Alternatively, some of these may be involved in motor neuron-muscle signaling related to food intake. In support of this idea, CHA-1 was reported to participate in determining pharyngeal pumping rate to affect food intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>.</p>
              <p>The combined results suggest that environmental factors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity, modulate neuronal or endocrine signaling to induce some of “longevity-promoting” processes, including dietary-restriction signaling, stabilization of protein structure, or dauer-related efficient life maintenance during harsh conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). However, it should be noted that whether suppression of Q35 aggregation and the expression of the seven studied genes is due to microgravity or other environmental factors such as radiation is still uncertain, because the necessary experiments under the artificial gravitational field of the earth (1 G) in space environments have not been performed. Although further investigation regarding the effects of a decrease in the expression of the present genes comparable to the level in spaceflight and a simultaneous decrease in the expression of all these genes on lifespan is required, the present findings suggest that space-flown worms age more slowly compared with ground control worms and further predict that spaceflight extends worm lifespan. Male <italic>Drosophila</italic> lived shorter on the ground after spaceflight compared to controls that maintained on the ground through their lifetimes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Further investigation is needed to compare aging and lifespan under microgravity and 1 G in space environments.</p>

                <title>Determination of lifespan</title>
                <p>Eggs isolated after treatment of gravid adult worms with hypochlorite were incubated in S basal at 20°C for 1 day. Lifespan was determined in three ways. First, the hatched L1 larvae were placed on NGM agar covered with UV-killed OP50. UV killing was used to avoid any toxic effects of live <italic>E. coli</italic> on <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Second, the hatched L1 worms were placed on NGM agar covered with RNAi-expressing or vector control bacteria<italic>.</italic> In these two assay systems, worms were transferred to fresh plates every other day. Third, the hatched L1 worms were inoculated into CeMM. In every case, synchronous L4/young adult stage worms estimated as 0-day adults in the lifespan assay were treated with 40 µM FUdU to prevent self-fertilization. The number of surviving worms was monitored until death as judged by nonresponse to a mechanical stimulus. To focus on aging, we excluded worms that had become desiccated on the side of the plate after crawling off in the former two assay systems, and that displayed extruded internal organs, and those that died because of progeny hatching inside the uterus (matricidal death). The results of the survival assays were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and significance was measured with the log-rank test using the statistical analysis package StatMate III (ATMS, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

After removal of the adult hermaphrodites, the plates were incubated at 25°C for 3 days and scored for dauer arrest.

                <p>(A) Eggs obtained by treatment of gravid-adult Q35–YFP transgenic worms with hypochlorite were allowed to hatch and maintained at L1 larva stage in CeMM for 7 days at 12°C. Then, temperature was shifted to 20°C. Worms grew to adult stage and started to lay eggs at 7 days after the temperature shift, on the other hand, the progenies produced by these worms did not grow to adult stage by 11 days after the temperature shift. Therefore, at 9 days after the temperature shift, adults seen in culture could be considered as the worms originally inoculated. (B) L4/young adult worms were incubated in CeMM with 40 μM FUdR for 7 days at 12°C and temperature was shifted to 20°C. Average numbers of Q35 aggregates/worm of more than 40 worms were plotted against time after the temperature shift to 20°C with ± S.E. Absent error bars indicate that errors fell within symbols. These figures show one of two trials, each of which gave similar results.</p>

                <p>Q35-YFP transgenic worms were inoculated into CeMM with 40 μM FUdR at L4/young adult stage (A, D, F) or without FUdR at egg stage (B, E, G), and incubated on ground for 5 days at 12°C. Then they were space-flown or on ground for 2 days at 12°C and for next 9 days at 20°C. In B, E, and G, only adult worms in the samples containing L1, L2 and adult stage worms were measured as adult worms were considered as the worms originally inoculated (See Legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Numbers of Q35 aggregates were counted from the photographs of worms obtained by a fluorescence microscope (as in (C)) using ImageJ software (Analyze Particles). (A, B) Numbers of Q35 aggregates per worm are shown. * vs ** and # vs ##: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 (Student's t test). (C) Photographs of YFP fluorescence of the worms flown in space from L1 stage and matched ground control are shown. Bars show 100 μm.

                <p>The feeding RNAi of the designated genes against Q35-YFP transgenic worms was conducted as described in Methods for RNAi. L3 larval worms were placed on RNAi-expressing or mock-vector control bacteria. Worms were incubated for 2 days at 20°C until they became gravid adults. The gravid adults were transferred to fresh RNAi-expressing bacteria lawns and allowed to lay eggs for 2 hours and removed and eggs were allowed to grow for subsequent assays.
