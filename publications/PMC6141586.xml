                <p id="Par1">Spaceflight causes muscle wasting. The Sarcolab pilot study investigated two astronauts with regards to plantar flexor muscle size, architecture, and function, and to the underlying molecular adaptations in order to further the understanding of muscular responses to spaceflight and exercise countermeasures. Two crew members (A and B) spent 6 months in space. Crew member A trained less vigorously than B. Postflight, A showed substantial decrements in plantar flexor volume, muscle architecture, in strength and in fiber contractility, which was strongly mitigated in B. The difference between these crew members closely reflected FAK-Y397 abundance, a molecular marker of muscle’s loading history. Moreover, crew member A showed downregulation of contractile proteins and enzymes of anaerobic metabolism, as well as of systemic markers of energy and protein metabolism. However, both crew members exhibited decrements in muscular aerobic metabolism and phosphate high energy transfer. We conclude that countermeasures can be effective, particularly when resistive forces are of sufficient magnitude. However, to fully prevent space-related muscular deterioration, intersubject variability must be understood, and intensive exercise countermeasures programs seem mandatory. Finally, proteomic and metabolomic analyses suggest that exercise benefits in space may go beyond mere maintenance of muscle mass, but rather extend to the level of organismic metabolism.</p>

                <title>Muscles: Onboard exercise limits muscle loss in space</title>
                <p id="Par2">Physical activity with resistive forces helps preserve muscle volume, architecture and strength in space. A team led by Jörn Rittweger from the German Aerospace Center in Cologne studied two crew members who spent six months on board the International Space Station. During the Sarcolab pilot study, one of these astronauts performed less exercise than the other. After returning to Earth, the one who trained less showed more substantial deterioration of the plantar flexor muscle in the foot—a difference detectable also at the molecular level, with lower levels of proteins involved in anaerobic and aerobic muscle metabolism. The findings highlight the need to vigorously exercise in space to limit muscle weakness. Doing so does not seem to fully prevent space-related problems, though, as evidenced by signs of muscle wasting even in the astronaut who trained regularly.</p>

              <p id="Par3">Physical deconditioning is known to occur during spaceflight since Skylab and Mir missions. Lower limb muscles, in particular, undergo rapid wasting and loss of function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Most affected is the triceps surae muscle, where 20% fiber atrophy occurs after 6 months of spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> In ground-based models (e.g. bed rest), muscle atrophy is associated with decreases in fascicle pennation angle and length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Alterations of muscle architecture are expected to affect the mechanical output, thereby contributing to muscle weakness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Moreover, muscle unloading also leads to reductions in the fibers’ specific force and power, and in myosin heavy chain (MCH) concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> All these factors can independently alter the mechanical capabilities of muscles.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Muscle atrophy results from imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation. This imbalance can be caused by enhanced muscle protein breakdown (MPB), controlled by catabolic pathways (ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy), and also by inhibited muscle protein synthesis (MPS), controlled by the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> To date, the relative contribution of MPB and MPS is still unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> The determination of the actual rates of protein synthesis and degradation in humans is challenging. The relative activation of intracellular pathways involved varies across species and disuse conditions. Moreover, it is unclear whether a metabolic program plays a relevant role in causing disuse atrophy in humans. Recently, it has been suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major trigger of MPB and MPS imbalance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> Solving these open issues is important for spaceflight.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Countermeasure exercises are nowadays mandatory on board the International Space Station (ISS). With regards to muscle, they involve exercises with the advanced resistive exercise device (aRED) and a treadmill (T2). Effects of strength training upon skeletal muscle on Earth have been studied extensively, but relatively little is known about the molecular events in disuse or in spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> It is therefore an open question how far training in space is helpful to maintain the lower limb musculature.</p>
              <p id="Par6">Costameric proteins can serve as a molecular proxy of the muscle’s loading history.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> They anchor the sarcomeres to extracellular matrix receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Among these, the integrin-linked focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a mechanically regulated costamere component that controls the turnover of focal adhesion in a fiber type-specific manner together with FAK-related non-kinase FRNK, FAK’s natural inhibitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Herein, the content of post-translation modification of tyrosine 397 (Y397) is a critical event, which is affecting the activity of FAK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Importantly, the FAK pathway likely controls protein synthesis through 70S6K, a component of the Akt/mTOR pathway.</p>
              <p id="Par7">Thus, the Sarcolab study has been designed to: (i) disentangle the various constituents of muscle weakness associated with spaceflight; (ii) elucidate the muscular adaptations to long-term spaceflight; (iii) address the affected molecular and metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle and in the blood in astronauts during long missions on ISS. The main hypothesis of the Sarcolab study is that alterations in the physiological cross-sectional area, fiber length, as well as in single fiber mechanics collectively contribute to the space-related muscle weakness. Moreover, the study aims to screen for muscle proteomic adaptations to spaceflight. Finally, intracellular signaling pathways, namely those controlling muscle mass (ubiquitin proteasome pathway, autophagy, FAK) and metabolism (PGC-1alpha, SREBP-1) are studied, and blood metabolomics screens for systemic consequences-related muscular alterations. The present paper reports results from two astronauts who took part in the Sarcolab pilot study, before the experiment had been enlarged into the currently performed three-agency study (Sarcolab3), supported by ESA, NASA, and Roscosmos.</p>

More specifically, crew member A demonstrated distinct increases in troponin I fast (TNNI2) and in two proteoforms of troponin T fast (TNNT3), and decreases in two proteoforms of troponin T slow (TNNT1). Notably, where PF-1 changes in the troponins were observed in B, they were in the opposite direction in crew member A. At PF-2, some moderate decreases in actin proteoforms (ACTA1) were observed in both crew members.</p>
                <p id="Par19">Proteins involved in <italic>anaerobic metabolism</italic> were also affected by spaceflight. Crew member A depicted decreases in four different proteoforms of glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM) at PF-1, as well as increases in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1) and in one beta-enolase proteoform (ENO3). By contrast, B depicted increases in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatase dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2), alpha-enolase (ENO1), three proteoforms of ENO3 and pyruvate kinase (PKM). At PF-2, two of the PYGM proteoforms were recovered in crew member A, but decreases in two proteoforms of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) and <sc>l</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase A chain (LDHA) occurred at that time. Thus, dysregulation of glycogen metabolism and accumulation of specific enolase proteoforms appeared postflight in crew member A, whereas crew member B adapted metabolically to spaceflight by increasing anaerobic metabolism.</p>
                <p id="Par20">Concerning <italic>aerobic metabolism</italic>, enzymes involved in malate shuttle, in oxidative phosphorylation and in lipid metabolism were downregulated in both crew members at PF-1 and at PF-2. In crew member A, this encompassed virtually all enzymes, except that NADH dehydrogenase iron-sulfur protein 3 (NDUFS3) was upregulated. Crew member B depicted a very similar response as A, except that NDUFS3 was down- rather than upregulated (Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Thus, aerobic metabolism seemed comparably compromised in both crew members.</p>
                <p id="Par21">Enzymes involved in high <italic>energy phosphate transfer</italic> likewise depicted a downregulation in both crew members postflight. This was more pronounced in crew member A than B. The enzymes affected involved four proteoforms of creatine kinase M-type (CKM) and creatine kinase S-type (CKMT2). Overall, dysregulation of high energy phosphate production could be a consequence of the severe impairment of aerobic metabolism, or vice versa.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par28">The present study provides a multifaceted account of strongly diverging responses to spaceflight in two astronauts. While crew member A exhibited the expected neuromuscular responses, namely decrements in plantar flexor muscle volume, altered architecture, reductions in contractile protein composition, downgraded fiber contractility, and thus overall muscle strength, crew member B was much less affected after long-term spaceflight. Notably, the loading levels achieved by crew member B are rarely seen in other crew members on ISS. It is therefore tempting to ascribe the salient differences between A and B to the different muscular exercises, in particular with regards to resistive forces. One could therefore ascribe the divergent muscle proteomic responses (contractile proteins and aerobic metabolism affected in crew member A, but almost not in B), as well as differences in the response of the catabolic pathways (greater activation of ubiquitin proteasome system and of autophagy in crew member A), and in systemic metabolic profiles (greater effects upon energy and protein metabolism in A than in B) to the different countermeasure regimens. These findings therefore underline the importance of the onboard exercise. However, the 23% decrement in muscle fiber CSA coupled to the activation of catabolic pathways that was still occurring in crew member B, and the fact that aerobic metabolism and high phosphate energy transfer were also compromised in crew member B may suggest that complete preservation of the musculature in space is not yet achievable.</p>
              <p id="Par29">It is also intriguing that the response of the load-dependent parameters, pY397-FAK and meta-vinculin concentration, but not FAK or FRNK, reflect the diverging responses in muscle mass and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> The observed downregulation of FAK and FRNK protein levels at PF-1 replicate earlier findings in antigravity muscles of rats and humans, implicating a requirement of gravitational loading to maintain the gene products of the FAK gene (i.e. PTK2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> The present observations confirm that muscle response to unloading involves a net reduction in the capacity for regulation of costamere turnover via Y397 phosphorylated FAK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> Consistent with this notion, the concentration of both FAK and FRNK increased 2 weeks after return to Earth, indicating reestablishment of adhesion sites in the sarcolemma with resumption of load-bearing muscle activity. Alterations in the proxy of costamere remodeling, FAK-pY397, were inversely related to alterations in the concentration of the costameric protein meta-vinculin and tenascin-C at PF-1 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Figures <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>−<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). At this time point, and in absolute terms at postflight session 2, expression of meta-vinculin and tenascin-C postflight was considerably less affected in crew member B, while FAK-pY397 concentration was selectively increased in this crew member. This is consistent with the reported upregulation of FAK-pY397 concentration by muscle loading and the greater extent of muscle loading of crew member B than A during the onboard exercise (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> Collectively, the study of costamere-associated proteins suggests protection of the soleus muscle in crew member B inflight, but muscle damage due to unaccustomed mechanical loading after return to Earth.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Importantly, the adaptations in the FAK pathway, modulating the anabolic Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, can link the unloading and muscle atrophy to the imbalance between protein synthesis and degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par31">Interestingly, muscular aerobic metabolism was compromised in both crew members, notwithstanding the extensive treadmill exercise performed by crew member B and the enhanced expression of PGC-1alpha. PCG-1alpha enhances mitochondrial biosynthesis and oxidative metabolism and is a key regulator in the metabolic response to endurance training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> In disuse, PGC-1alpha expression is reduced in soleus muscle of mice and in vastus lateralis muscle of humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Reduced expression of PGC-1alpha has been considered a relevant cause of muscle atrophy, suggesting a “metabolic” program of muscle atrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> The higher expression of PGC-1alpha in this study is surprising. Possibly, inflight countermeasures have prevented PGC-1alpha downregulation. Alternatively, PGC-1alpha upregulation could be an unsuccessful attempt to counteract the decrease in energy levels, namely an increase in AMP and a decrease in ATP due to impaired energy metabolism.</p>
              <p id="Par32">Expression of SREBP-1, a master regulator of lipid metabolism, was increased in the soleus muscle in both crew members after spaceflight. This is consistent with the observation that weightlessness induces intramuscular lipid accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is interesting that NRF2, a transcription factor sensitive to intracellular ROS and simultaneously a stimulator of antioxidant defense systems, was elevated in crew member B, but not in crew member A. Redox imbalance had been observed in human bed rest and in hindlimb suspended mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> However, as crew member B performed more exercise and had less muscle atrophy than A, the higher NRF2 expression in B could be due to an aerobically more intense exercise regimen in B than in A, inasmuch as oxygen demand in running increases with loading forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Given that NRF2 and proteoforms related to mitochondrial and aerobic metabolism were divergently affected by space, one might thus even speculate about a relative overemphasis of aerobic exercise, similar to overtraining on Earth.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Both crew members diverged also in their metabolomic profiles. While postflight changes in crew member A were more pronounced for energy than for amino acid metabolism, the opposite was true for crew member B. Moreover, the increases in glucose, pyruvate, and pyruvate/lactate ratio in crew member A can be understood as the metabolic consequence of muscle wasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Interestingly, both crew members’ metabolic profiles appeared distinct already before launch, as shown by PCA. During spaceflight, they responded in two different ways, moving toward different positions at PF-1, and finally both reverted to their initial metabolic spaces at PF-2 (Figure <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). This behavior is consistent with the observed metabolic resilience previously described in healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="Par34">Collectively, these data show distinctly diverging responses in two crew members that performed countermeasure exercises at different intensities during their half-year sojourns on ISS, underlining the need of physical exercises in space. The findings also show that running as much as 500 km, with a resistive force close to the body weight, and performing 5000 heel raises at a force of more than twice the body weight was insufficient to entirely prevent muscle atrophy and weakness. Upregulation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and increased autophagy likely contributed to muscle wasting, more so in crew member A than B. Upregulation of PGC-1alpha was also found in both crew members, suggesting that the aerobic exercise performed onboard may have been sufficient to prevent disuse-induced decrease in PGC-1alpha, but not the impairment in metabolism and its impact on muscle integrity. The atrophy found both at whole muscle and single fiber level (mostly in crew member A) was associated with a reduction in FAK content and, in crew member A, also in phosphorylated FAK. Instead, in crew member B who exercised very intensively, FAK-pY397 levels actually increased. We have shown in previous ground-based studies that FAK plays an essential role in skeletal muscle remodeling with use, disuse and ageing and the present results confirm its role in regulating muscle mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> Adaptations of FAK pathway could, in fact, inhibit protein synthesis and contribute to muscle atrophy. Finally, proteomic assessment of muscle tissue and metabolomic blood analyses indicate that exercise may have benefits in space that go far beyond mere maintenance of muscle mass and strength.</p>
