                <p>In plant cells, the nucleus DNA is considered the primary site of injury by the space environment, which could generate genetic alteration. As the part of genomic mutation, genetic variation in the promoter region could regulate gene expression. In the study, it is observed that there is a deletion in the upstream regulatory region of the <italic>1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1</italic> gene (<italic>PpDXS1</italic>) of <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> dwarf mutant and the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> transcript abundance is lower in the dwarf mutant. It is indicated that the deletion in the promoter region between wild type and dwarf mutant could be responsible for the regulation of <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene expression. The <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter of dwarf mutant shows a lower activity as determined by dual luciferase assay in <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> protoplast, as well as the <italic>GUS</italic> activity is lower in transgenic <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> plant. To further investigate the effect of the deletion in the promoter region on <italic>PpDXS1</italic> transcript accumulation, the transient assay and yeast one-hybrid experiment demonstrate that the deletion comprises a motif which is a target of G-box binding factor (GBF1), and the motif correlates with an increase in transactivation by GBF1 protein. Taken together, these results indicate that the deletion in the promoter of <italic>PpDXS1</italic> isolated from dwarf mutant is sufficient to account for the decrease in <italic>PpDXS1</italic> transcript level and GBF1 can regulate the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene expression, and subsequently affect accumulation of various isoprenoids throughout the plant.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Terpenoids are a large group of primary and secondary metabolites involved in plant life processes, and there is mounting evidence that metabolites such as phytohormones and chlorophyll can regulate their growth and development [<xref rid="B1-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Historically, some monoterpene, diterpene, and other secondary metabolites are derived from plastidic methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways [<xref rid="B3-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the literature, 1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXS) can broadly defined as the first limited enzyme of the MEP pathway [<xref rid="B4-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The <italic>DXS</italic> gene was first introduced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>DXS</italic> homologs were subsequently found in model plants and crops [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies showed that DXS is encoded by a small gene family and two or three <italic>DXS</italic> homologs generally divided into three independent clades [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The <italic>DXS1</italic> gene is proved to be involved in primary metabolism (e.g., chlorophyll synthesis, photosynthetic processes), and mainly expressed in photosynthetic tissues [<xref rid="B7-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, the <italic>DXS2</italic> and <italic>DXS3</italic> genes in various plants are thought to be involved in biotic or abiotic resistance defenses and produce special secondary metabolites in defense responses [<xref rid="B6-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
              <p>Space mutation factor, including the microgravity, cosmic radiation, hypomagnetic field and vibration, etc., can trigger non-directional variation in plants. Cosmic radiation, as one of the main factors can produce genetic changes in seeds and meristems as a result of phenotypical alterations and metabolism [<xref rid="B11-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In plant cells, the nucleus DNA is considered the principal site of injury by radiation, which is responsible for non-targeted damage and generates different kinds of mutations, such as base deletions, base substitutions, translocations, inversions and large insertions [<xref rid="B12-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to the high conservation of most functional genes, they are less prone to mutagenesis or easily repaired after mutation by the space environment. But mutations in the upstream promoter of genes will affect gene expression, which lead to changes in the gene function associated with plant growth and development. It is known that gene expression is controlled at many levels with key regulatory elements being located in non-coding regions of the genome, such as promoter, intron, and 3′ UTRs [<xref rid="B14-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides, gene expression-associated variants within regulatory regions are anticipated to mediate an effect on trans-acting regulatory factors (e.g., transcription factors and miRNAs). For example, the insertion of transposable elements in the promoter region of maize genes exhibit activation of gene expression [<xref rid="B15-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another example by Mernke et al. [<xref rid="B16-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was that the rearrangement caused by insertion of a retroelement-derived sequence in the promoter region of <italic>major facilitator superfamily transporter</italic> gene (<italic>mfsM2</italic>) resulted in its overexpression, which is responsible for the appearance and subsequent spread of multidrug resistance in vineyards. Besides, Espley et al. [<xref rid="B17-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported that a rearrangement in the upstream regulatory region of the <italic>myeloblastosis 10</italic> (<italic>MYB10</italic>) gene in apple is responsible for the increase in MYB10 transcript levels and subsequent ectopic accumulation of anthocyanins.</p>
              <p>There are many examples of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation (e.g., external factors) of <italic>DXS</italic> gene expression and enzyme activity [<xref rid="B5-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therein, a number of cis-acting elements in <italic>DXS</italic> promoter play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>DXS</italic> gene expression in various plants, such as sequences over-represented in light-induced promoters (SORLIP1-AT) associated with light-regulation, GATA box (a gibberellin-responsive element) and etc. [<xref rid="B19-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although several studies regarding <italic>DXS</italic> gene expression and the cis-regulatory elements of <italic>DXS</italic> promoter have been performed, the relationship between the insertion/deletion in the promoter of <italic>DXS</italic> gene caused by space mutation and its gene expression have not been reported, which is worth further investigation.</p>
              <p>Here, we reported a 500 bp-fragment in the upstream regulatory of <italic>DXS1</italic> gene found only in the wild type of Kentucky bluegrass (<italic>Poa pratensis</italic> L., KB), but it is lacking in the dwarf mutant derived from the space-exposed KB seeds. In the previous study, the transcript abundance of <italic>DXS1</italic> gene in the wild type is higher than in the dwarf mutant and there was no difference in the amino acid sequence of <italic>DXS1</italic> isolated from the two plants. However, we would like to know whether the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene expression is associated with the difference of the promoter region. By dual luciferase assay and genetic transformation in KB, the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter isolated from the wild type contained the functional 500 bp-deletion showed a higher activity in protoplast, as well as the <italic>GUS</italic> expression was higher in transgenic KB constitutively expressed the promoter from wild type. Also, there is an important motif binding with GBF1 (G-box binding factor) protein in the 500 bp-deletion fragment. By transient assay and yeast one-hybrid experiment, the transcription factor could activate the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> transcript accumulation, leading to the subsequent accumulation of various isoprenoids throughout the plant.</p>

                <title>2.1. Isolation of Upstream Regulatory Region of PpDXS1</title>
                <p>To investigate the molecular basis of the phenotype of dwarf mutant induced by spaceflight, genome walking was applied to isolated the upstream sequence of <italic>PpDXS1</italic>. Sequences of upstream region were cloned from both KB’s wild type (WT) and dwarf mutant (A16), whose lengths were 1649 bp and 1864 bp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The isolated DNA fragments revealed two sequences of different component and rearrangement in the full length, while the two different sequences share two same segments as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The segment 3 (500 bp) was present in the wild type (WT) but absent in dwarf mutant (A16). Besides, the other fragment contained an insertion of 715 bp (segment 4).</p>
                <p>A motif search of the two promoter sequences was performed using the PlantCARE databases to reveal putative cis element. Except the core promoter element (TATA-box, CAAT-box, and GC-motif), other elements that corresponded to light response, hormone metabolism, and stress defense regulatory were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>). They are: MBS (MYB binding site involved in drought-inducibility), ABRE element (abscisic acid response factor), JERE (related to jasmonic acid and ethylene responsiveness), TCA element (involved in salicylic acid responsiveness), MRE and Chs-CMA2b (involved in light responsiveness), and protein binding sites (G-box, HD-ZIP3). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>, sequences in promoter segment 1 and 2 were similar by over 95% and had common elements, while the segment 3 comprised several unique cis elements (e.g., G-box) in WT that were not found in A16 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Table S1</xref>). Analysis of these different segments and specific motifs of the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter region may identify the functional significance of regulatory elements for the expression of the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene and thus provide some clues for the dwarf mechanism by this gene.</p>

                <title>2.2. Activity of PpDXS1 Promoter in the Dual Luciferase Transient Protoplast Assay</title>
                <p>One possible result of the different segments or rearrangement within the promoter of <italic>PpDXS1</italic> in WT and A16 is an alteration in the basal activity of the promoter. A preliminary experiment has shown that when the two versions of full-length promoter were fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (<italic>EGFP</italic>) into KB protoplast, the green fluorescent could be detected under the fluorescence microscope. Although the activities of the two promoters were both observed, whether there are differences within full or part of promoter in activity requires quantitative verification. A dual luciferase assay was used to quantify the activity of the different segment or group of the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter. The full-region and different segment of <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter, including segment_1, segment_1+2, segment_1+4, segment_1+2+3 and segment_1+4+2, were individually fused to firefly luciferase (<italic>Fluc</italic>) and transactivation of the <italic>Fluc</italic> gene measured relative to renilla luciferase (<italic>Rluc</italic>) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV 35S) by measurement of luminescence after transient expression in KB protoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). There are a number of important differences in relative activity of various promoter segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The relative activity of DXSpro_WT_<italic>Fluc</italic> tends to have positive correlation with the promoter length, while the DXSpro_A16_<italic>Fluc</italic> varied with segment arrangement in the dwarf mutant. Besides, the relative activity of segment_1+4+2 was lower than the segment_1+2+3, as well as the segment_1+4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p>

                <title>2.3. Promoter Activity in Poa pratensis Plants</title>
                <p>Next, we analyzed the promoter in <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>. The two version of full-length <italic>DXS</italic> promoters were cloned into a binary vector and fused downstream of a <italic>GUS</italic> reporter gene and introduced into <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>. The CaMV 35S promoter fused to the <italic>GUS</italic> gene served as the positive control. A variety of independent transgenic lines were generated through particle bombardment transformation, including one DXSpro_WT line, three DXSpro_A16 lines and two pCAMBIA1301 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). <italic>Pgk1</italic>, a single-copy gene in Poaceae family, was used to evaluate the copies of <italic>GUS</italic> gene in transgenic lines by quantitative RT-PCR. These results showed that total transgenic lines of inserted DXSpro is single copy (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Table S4</xref>).</p>
                <p>Firstly, the activity of the promoters was examined through GUS histochemical staining in transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Figure S1</xref>). The staining results showed that GUS activity is detected in the transgenic lines, but GUS activity of the DXSpro_WT line was higher than that of DXSpro_A16 and both of them were lower than that of CaMV 35S promoter. In order to further evaluate the activity of the <italic>DXS1</italic> promoters, we compared the expression level of the <italic>GUS</italic> gene in the leaves of <italic>DXSpro-WT:GUS</italic>, <italic>DXSpro-A16:GUS</italic> and <italic>CaMV35S:GUS</italic> plants. We observed that the <italic>GUS</italic> gene expression in transformed <italic>DXSpro-A16:GUS</italic> lines was significantly decreased compared with <italic>DXSpro-WT:GUS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). These results support the fact that the deletion and/or insertion in <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter are presented with different transcriptional levels in <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>.</p>

                <title>2.4. Enhanced Activity by Addition of GBF1 to DXS1 Promoter</title>
                <p>To identify any possible cis-elements located within the functional region of <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter, we surveyed the DXSpro_WT and DXSpro_A16 region for the presence of known transcriptional factor binding sites using the online TRANSFAC and JASPAR database (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Table S2</xref>). Therein, a G-box element (CACGAT) was only observed at the -1455 positions (segment 3) in the DXSpro_WT region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>). G-box binding protein is a big family, which are important TFs regulating photosynthesis, including G-box binding factor 1 (GBF1), common plant regulatory factor 1 (CPRF1) etc. Moreover, a binding site of basic helix-loop-helix factor (bHLH112) was also predicted in the segment_1. To determine whether the GBF1 and bHLH112 proteins are involved in the induction of the <italic>DXS</italic> promoter and subsequently regulation of the expression of <italic>PpDXS1</italic>, we examined the additional effect of these transcription factors to <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). When segment_1+2+3 of <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter isolated from the wild-type plant was used as the reporter, the enhanced activity from the import of PpGBF1 transcriptional factors to DXSpro_WT was about 1.4-fold higher compared with the control, while PpCPRF1 and PpbHLH112 protein have no significant effect on the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). This induction of GBF1 to <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter demonstrated that GBF1 acts positively on the transcriptional level, which supports the hypothesis that the segment or elements lacking in A16 were responsible for <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter activity.</p>
                <p>To confirm further the DNA binding ability of PpGBF1, PpCPRF1 and PpbHLH112, we performed a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay in which these transcription factors were examined for different segments of the promoter region. Our Y1H assays showed that the PpGBF1 directly interacts with segment_3 of the <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). No interaction was detected between PpCPRF1 and each segment of promoter, although the yeast was grown in the first dilution. Besides, PpCPRF1 and PpbHLH112 did not interact with whether deletion or insert segment of <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Figure S2</xref>). This is consistent with the result of dual luciferase assay. Taken together, these findings indicate that PpGBF1 binds to the deleted segment of DXS1pro_A16, and presumably the transcription factor elevated the <italic>DXS1</italic> gene expression.</p>

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>In our previous work, <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> seeds were carried on a space flight for 18 days on the 20th returnable satellite and returned to the ground to plant together with the wild type in the same growth conditions. Besides, we isolated <italic>1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1</italic> gene (<italic>PpDXS1</italic>) from <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> wild-type (WT) and dwarf mutant (A16) plant respectively and found no significant mutation in the coding region, while the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene expression is higher in the WT compared with A16. So, we wonder what else decreased the <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene expression. In this study, the promoter sequences of <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene were isolated from two cultivars by hi-Tail-PCR technology. Sequence analysis showed that, compared with WT, 715-bp insertions and 500-bp deletions in the promoter region were identified in A16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It is speculated that the mutation after spaceflight induced these insertion and deletion of fragments in the <italic>DXS1</italic> gene promoter region. Other studies also showed that space environmental factors (e.g., ionizing radiation and microgravity) can produce induced mutations in the plant genome, such as insertion or deletion [<xref rid="B21-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Whether insertion or deletion occur in coding sequences or in non-coding regions (e.g., promoter and gene spacing regions), it is prone to affect gene expression and phenotype [<xref rid="B25-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, the 193-bp insert and 397-bp deletion in the promoter region of <italic>Hordeum vulgare waxy</italic> gene altered transcription, therein 397-bp deletion probably resulted in the decreased granule-bound starch synthase [<xref rid="B28-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
              <p>We used a transient assay to analyse the promoter activity of the differential and common segments from two cultivar sequences, to estimate which variation would affect the expression of <italic>DXS</italic> gene by fusing a <italic>Fluc</italic> reporter in <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> protoplast. From partial segments to complete the promoter, the transcriptional activity of the promoter from the WT was increased as the length in the transient assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f002">Figure 2</xref>B), while the relative activity of A16 complete promoter sequence was not only lower than WT, but also the insertion with the common fragments itself (segment_1+4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). It is indicated that these sequences were involved in the deletion and/or insertion and the functional binding of transcription factors, so we would focus on these different segments.</p>
              <p>Besides, the construct of native promoter with <italic>GUS</italic> reporter built to study the effect of different promoter in the stable expressed <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>. In the data set presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f003">Figure 3</xref>, all the transgenic lines of A16 promoter showed a reduction in the transcriptional level of the <italic>GUS</italic> gene compared with the WT promoter transformed plants. One explanation is that some suppressed motif was formed at the junction between the insertion and common fragment (segment_1/2). However, after the search of the A16 promoter sequence in the PlantCARE database, we did find the published motifs or binding sites with inhibitor effect. It is necessary to investigate and verify the existence of inhibitory sites in the future. Another explanation may be that deletion in the promoter region of the dwarf mutant contains protein binding sites that enhance transcriptional activity. There have been a considerable number of investigations associating 5′-upstream deletion analysis with transcriptional regulation [<xref rid="B29-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Atanassova et al. [<xref rid="B31-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] demonstrated that deletion of the upstream 558 bp of <italic>histone</italic> gene promoter reduced its activity, and pointed out that internal deletion of a sequence containing histone-specific motifs also reduced the promoter activity. Unlike Atanassova, Zheng and Murai [<xref rid="B32-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that any deletion from the 4.6 kb-long <italic>glutelin</italic> gene promoter region reduced the GUS activity in homologous rice but no distinct element was evident within the region by deletion analysis. So, these cases show that the deletion of promoter region associating with the change of transcriptional level depends on whether the deletion region contains distinct regulatory motifs and conceivable factors binding to the motif.</p>
              <p>To further analyze the deletion and insert region necessary for transcriptional activation or suppression, we used a transient transactivation assay to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) that were able to interact specifically with the different segment. After the search progress of various database, a data set of predicted transcription factors (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Table S1</xref>) and putative binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-01398-f001">Figure 1</xref>) was found in <italic>PpDXS1</italic> promoter. Interestingly, the deficiency segment of A16 promoter region contained a G-box site which was predicted to bind with the relevant G-box binding factors (GBFs). Generally, GBFs can be divided into three sub-groups involved in the two TFs superfamily, basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) types [<xref rid="B33-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Long hypocothyl 5 (HY5) protein and phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs) are typical representatives of the two sub-groups of GBFs respectively [<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Besides, proline-rich domain of GBF-1 protein (bZIP type) contribute to the function of activating transcription in Arabidopsis.</p>
              <p>Considering the result of promoter-TFs prediction analysis, we verified whether candidate TFs (GBF1, CPRF1 and bHLH112 protein) bind to DXSpro_WT (containing the G-box site) through the luciferase protoplast assay. The resulting transactivation level showed there are little or no enhancements of the DXSpro_WT with <italic>35S:bHLH112</italic> and <italic>35S:CPRF1</italic>, in contrast with the observed enhancement when <italic>35S:GBF1</italic> was co-expressed in the <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> protoplast. We have demonstrated that the presence of GBF1 probably changes the transcription level, and we predicted that a G-box binding site is only located in the segment 3 of DXSpro_WT. After the yeast one-hybrid experiment, we also see the confirmed result that GBF1 only bind to the segment 3 of DXSpro_WT region (containing G-box site). Interestingly, at the same time, it has been recently reported that PIFs regulated the <italic>DXS1</italic> gene in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, probably through the PBE box (CACATG), whereas HY5 induces the expression of this gene through direct binding to the G-box containing core GCE element (ACGT) [<xref rid="B34-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Importantly, we also provided evidence that overexpressing <italic>GBF1</italic> in transgenic <italic>Poa pratensis</italic> plant elevate the transcript level of <italic>PpDXS1</italic> gene. Hence together, our data support the assertion that deletion of the predicted G-box in the distal promoter region may account for the reduced transactivation levels and GBF1 are the strongest candidates to bind with G-box site of <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter in <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>.</p>
              <p>Overall, our data suggest that a rearrangement in the upstream regulatory promoter region of the <italic>DXS1</italic> gene has significant impacts for the level of transcription in <italic>Poa pratensis</italic>, particularly due to the binding of GBF1 and deletion containing the G-box motif in the promoter region. While the significant differences of <italic>DXS1</italic> promoter and transcription regulation of GBF1 plays an important role in the multiple downstream pathways, such as chlorophyll and hormone synthesis, external condition and post-translational regulatory factors also control the plant growth and development [<xref rid="B35-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>

Leaf tissues cut into 1mm strips were immersed in enzymatic hydrolysate (2% cellulase, 1% pectinase, 1% macerozyme R-10 and 0.6 M mannitol). After digestion for 7 h in the dark at a speed of 40~80 r/min, W5 solution [<xref rid="B39-ijms-20-01398" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] of equal volume was slowly added to the mix, and then the liquid containing protoplast filtered through 200-mesh nylon was collected into a 50 mL-tube.

                <p>Total RNA from leaves was obtained TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using 100~500 mg tissue homogenized in liquid nitrogen according to the protocol. Its quantity and purity were assessed using the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) and reverse transcriptional reaction was carried out with 0.5 µg total RNA using PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time) (Takara Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) according to the supplier’s instruction.</p>
                <p>Real-time PCR was carried out using a SYBR Green assay (Takara, Dalian, China) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 System (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Each 10 µL assay contained 5 µL SYBR Premix Ex Taq, 1 µL cDNA and 100 nM of each primer (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-01398">Table S3</xref>). Analysis were done with three independent experiments and technical duplicates were included in each case (<italic>n</italic> = 3). The relative mRNA abundance was calculated by using the comparative <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> method (2<sup>−ΔΔ<italic>C</italic>t</sup>) and normalization to actin gene. Besides, <italic>pgk1</italic> gene is known as the single copy gene in Poaceae family, so it was used to determine the copy number of transgenic gene (<italic>GUS</italic> and <italic>GBF1</italic>) by the formula of <italic>GUS</italic> or <italic>GBF1</italic> gene <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> value/<italic>pgk1</italic> gene <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub>.</p>
