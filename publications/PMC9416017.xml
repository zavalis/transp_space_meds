                <p>Studies on microorganism response spaceflight date back to 1960. However, nothing conclusive is known concerning the effects of spaceflight on virulence and environmental tolerance of entomopathogenic fungi; thus, this area of research remains open to further exploration. In this study, the entomopathogenic fungus <italic toggle="yes">Beauveria bassiana</italic> (strain SB010) was exposed to spaceflight (ChangZheng 5 space shuttle during 5 May 2020 to 8 May 2020) as a part of the Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China, in collaboration with the China Space Program. The study revealed significant differences between the secondary metabolite profiles of the wild isolate (SB010) and the spaceflight-exposed isolate (BHT021, BH030, BHT098) of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic>. Some of the secondary metabolites/toxins, including enniatin A2, brevianamide F, macrosporin, aphidicolin, and diacetoxyscirpenol, were only produced by the spaceflight-exposed isolate (BHT021, BHT030). The study revealed increased insecticidal activities for of crude protein extracts of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> spaceflight mutants (BHT021 and BH030, respectively) against <italic toggle="yes">Megalurothrips usitatus</italic> 5 days post application when compared crude protein extracts of the wild isolate (SB010). The data obtained support the idea of using space mutation as a tool for development/screening of fungal strains producing higher quantities of secondary metabolites, ultimately leading to increased toxicity/virulence against the target insect host.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>An increase in space exploration has resulted in an increase in studies on understanding the changes in physiology of living organisms under spaceflight conditions [<xref rid="B1-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Spaceflight conditions include long-term exposure to microgravity, radiation, and isolation [<xref rid="B2-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The higher costs, limited number of launches, and complexity of experimental design under space habitats are the main difficulties in performing studies under true spaceflight conditions, and consequently, many studies have also been performed under ground-based simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B3-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different investigations have explored the effects of space conditions on plants, animals, as well as microorganisms. However, microorganisms can be considered strong candidates to study the responses to variations in environmental conditions because of their rapid life cycle, easy handling, and stability [<xref rid="B4-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The explorations regarding influences of spaceflight on growth and metabolism of microorganisms have few significant implications. Firstly, microorganisms can impact (positively or negatively) human, animal and plant life [<xref rid="B6-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Secondly, they are known for producing secondary metabolites, which are used as medicine, biopesticides, plant growth-promoting agents, etc. [<xref rid="B7-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Several studies have explained the relationship between changed environmental conditions during spaceflight and variations in morphological as well as physiological characteristics of microorganisms, including germination, virulence, host pathogen relationship, secondary metabolite production, and gene expression [<xref rid="B2-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B9-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
              <p>Metabolism is the sum of all reactions in a living cell required for maintenance, development, and division. Microbial metabolism is comprised of primary metabolites (the intracellular molecules that enable growth and proliferation) and secondary metabolites (predominantly extracellular molecules that facilitate a microbe’s interaction and adaptation with its environment) [<xref rid="B10-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms are predominantly low-molecular-weight extracellular compounds [<xref rid="B12-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They are usually produced in late-exponential and stationary phases and are not directly associated with growth, development, or division of microorganisms [<xref rid="B10-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These specialized products are most notable for their use in healthcare settings as antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and pest-control agents [<xref rid="B13-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many of the intermediates in primary metabolism are precursors of secondary metabolites, and cells have evolved complex molecular switches linking primary and secondary metabolic pathways. These include high expression of the secondary metabolism genes at specific times in the cell cycle and controlling the flow of primary metabolites (carbon and nitrogen) through different pathways by feedback regulation [<xref rid="B12-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus far, studies on secondary metabolism have focused on only a few microorganisms (mainly <italic toggle="yes">Streptomycetes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus</italic>) and are mostly limited to one or a few metabolites per study. These studies have suggested altered secondary metabolite production levels, but the specific responses have been unique to each species. Furthermore, previous studies have been either limited to already-known metabolites or have focused on microorganisms that are already well-known metabolite producers. However, space vehicles hold diverse species whose behaviors are unstudied and could have responses under microgravity beyond prediction. Additionally, understanding microbes at a global metabolomics level could provide more comprehensive knowledge about the overall responses exhibited under microgravity.</p>
              <p>Filamentous fungi are a major group of microorganisms critical to the production of different commercial enzymes, biopesticides, and organic compounds [<xref rid="B19-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Several species of filamentous fungi belonging to the phylum Ascomycota (Subkingdom Dikarya) are known for their pathogenicity against insects [<xref rid="B21-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fungi belonging to genus <italic toggle="yes">Beauveria</italic> (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) are one of the most common insect pathogenic fungal species. <italic toggle="yes">Beauveria</italic> species are known to cause widespread epizootics of insect populations because of their saprophytic behavior [<xref rid="B22-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Studies regarding responses of microorganisms to spaceflight date back to 1960, but the responses to microgravity and its analogs have been investigated in a few microorganisms (bacteria as well as fungi), showing plausible but conflicting results for cellular growth rates and secondary metabolism under spaceflight and simulated microgravity experiments [<xref rid="B23-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To date, limited concrete studies on the influences/utilization of spaceflight on production of secondary metabolites by entomopathogenic fungi make this area of research open for detailed investigations.</p>
              <p>In this study, the entomopathogenic fungus <italic toggle="yes">Beauveria bassiana</italic> (SB010) was sent to the Taingong space station for exposure to spaceflight conditions on the ChangZheng 5 space shuttle during 5 May 2020 to 8 May 2020 as a part of the Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province, China, in collaboration with the China Space Program. The aims of this study were to (i) extract and characterize the changes in mycelial protein extract/secondary metabolites profiles of different <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> spaceflight mutants and (ii) undertake toxicity assays of mycelial extract/secondary metabolites <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> spaceflight mutants against <italic toggle="yes">Megalurothrips usitatus</italic> (Thysanoptera: Thripidae).</p>

              <title>2. Results</title>
              <p>Secondary metabolite production was quantified from the ethyl acetate extracts of wild isolate (SB010) and spaceflight mutants (BHT021, BHT030, BHT098) of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic>. The total protein concentration of ethyl acetate extract differed significantly among all four isolates (F<sub>3,8</sub> = 41.32, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The highest protein contents were obtained from the spaceflight mutant BHT021, with a mean value of 1.87 ± 0.035 mg/mL. For the wild isolate (SB010), the concentration of protein observed was 1.26 ± 0.03 mg/mL. The lowest protein content was produced by the space mutant BHT098, with a mean value of 1.05 ± 0.05 mg/mL (<xref rid="toxins-14-00555-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
              <p>As determined by LC-MS analysis, several differences were observed between the metabolite profiles of the four isolates (<xref rid="toxins-14-00555-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; <xref rid="app1-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="app">Supplementary file S1</xref>). A section of peaks between retention time of 8–9 min and 14.5–17 min was evident in the LC-MS profile of the spaceflight-exposed mutants (BHT021, BHT030, and BHT098) when compared with the wild isolate (SB010). In addition, a broader pattern of peaks between retention time of 10–11 min was observed for the spaceflight mutant BHT021 when compared with the wild isolate (SB010).

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>Studies investigating the influences of spaceflight on secondary metabolite production by microorganisms would be interesting, as the biosynthesis and concentration of microbial secondary metabolites are sensitive to extracellular environmental cues (nutrients availability, temperature, and osmotic stress) [<xref rid="B27-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The results showed significant changes in total yield and secondary metabolite profiles of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> spaceflight mutants and the wild isolate. These findings are consistent with Lam et al. [<xref rid="B29-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], who observed increased production of actinomycin D by <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces plicatus</italic> WC56452 after spaceflight on the U.S. Space Shuttle mission STS-80. Similarly, Luo et al. [<xref rid="B30-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] observed 13–18% higher production of nikkomycins by <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces ansochromogenus</italic> during 15 days of spaceflight. In a different study, Nikkomycins-producing strains of <italic toggle="yes">Streptomyces ansochromogenus</italic> were investigated to understand the biological response to production onboard a satellite for 15 days. The production of Nikkomycins in nearly all strains was reported to be increased by 13–18%, with increases specifically in Nikkomycin X and Z [<xref rid="B2-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B30-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, a study on <italic toggle="yes">Cupriavidus metallidurans</italic> under simulated microgravity showed increased production of the polyester polymer poly-b-hydroxybutyrate after 24 h but not after 48 h compared with ground controls [<xref rid="B7-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All these results suggest that effects of microgravity on secondary metabolism may be specific depending on the strain, growth condition, pathway utilized, or time course analyzed.</p>
              <p>Based on already-reported data and the results of this study as well as complexity of regulatory mechanisms of secondary metabolites production, the observed changes in secondary metabolite profiles of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> in response to spaceflight exposure can be strain, growth media, and secondary metabolism production pathway, depicting an inconsistent trend. These changes are induced by the indirect physical influences of spaceflight (such as variations in fluid dynamics or the extracellular transport of metabolites) [<xref rid="B2-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, different extracellular environmental cues can induce or enhance secondary metabolisms in different microorganisms, followed by the transfer of extracellular stresses to the downstream responsive genes by a cascade of complex signal transduction steps [<xref rid="B29-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, although all of the <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> space flight mutants went through same sort of extracellular stress, the amount and number of secondary metabolites produced by each mutant were different. In short, the changes in secondary metabolites production in <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> following spaceflight exposure were induced by the variations in micro-environments around the fungal cells [<xref rid="B2-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, space vehicles hold diverse species whose behaviors are unstudied and could have responses under microgravity beyond prediction. Additionally, understanding microbes at a global metabolomics level could provide more comprehensive knowledge about the overall responses exhibited under microgravity since entomopathogenic fungi offer a wealth of potential for the discovery of new and important microbial products for pest control. Broadening the horizon of fungal species and understanding the altered levels under microgravity could offer unique advantages for the biopesticides industry. There remains much to discover about the nature of diverse secondary metabolisms in such stressful environments of spaceflight. The changes of environmental factors, such as temperature, oxygen availability, and diffusion limitations, under microgravity can provide a condition that can be harnessed in the best way possible to be used for engineered microorganisms to generate useful metabolites. Therefore, understanding the specific cause-and-effect mechanisms of fungal responses to microgravity at the molecular level could provide ground-breaking discoveries for space applications and biopesticides development. However, in order to highlight the microbial responses to microgravity for long periods of time, different technologies (such as low-shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG)) have been developed to mimic real microgravity [<xref rid="B31-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and these technologies can be used more often (to mimic microgravity and ground level) to induce higher production of secondary metabolites by insect pathogenic fungi.</p>
              <p>The examination of the biological activities of fungal crude protein extracts from <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> wild isolate SB010 and space mutants (BHT021, BHT030, and BHT098), applied at different concentrations against <italic toggle="yes">M. usitatus</italic> adults, showed significantly different rates of insect mortality. The crude protein extracts of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> space mutants BHT021 and BHT030 (used at 100 μg/mL) induced higher mortality of <italic toggle="yes">M. usitatus</italic> adults when compared with the mortality caused by <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> wild isolate SB010. On the other hand, <italic toggle="yes">M. usitatus</italic> mortality observed in response to treatment with crude protein extracts of <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> space mutant BHT098 was lower than mortality caused by <italic toggle="yes">B. bassiana</italic> wild isolate SB010. Our results are similar to the already-reported previous studies on changes to microbial pathogens (<italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) induced by spaceflight [<xref rid="B29-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The transmission electron microscopy of the midgut of fourth instar <italic toggle="yes">M. usitatus</italic> adults showed nuclei enlargement, folding of nuclear membrane, and detachment of microvilli from midgut cells. The secretion of secondary metabolites is important for pathogenic processes, and variations in secondary metabolite profiles of spaceflight mutants compared to the wild isolate may have led to variations in biological activities of crude protein extracts against <italic toggle="yes">M. usitatus</italic>. These data further explain that increased secondary metabolism can increase the virulence of microorganisms [<xref rid="B2-toxins-14-00555" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
