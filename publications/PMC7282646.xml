              <abstract>
                <p>A systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of nutrition as a standalone countermeasure to ameliorate the physiological adaptations of the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity. A search strategy was developed to find all astronaut or human space flight bed rest simulation studies that compared individual nutritional countermeasures with non-intervention control groups. This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and tools created by the Aerospace Medicine Systematic Review Group for data extraction, quality assessment of studies and effect size. To ensure adequate reporting this systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. A structured search was performed to screen for relevant articles. The initial search yielded 4031 studies of which 10 studies were eligible for final inclusion. Overall, the effect of nutritional countermeasure interventions on the investigated outcomes revealed that only one outcome was in favor of the intervention group, whereas six outcomes were in favor of the control group, and 43 outcomes showed no meaningful effect of nutritional countermeasure interventions at all. The main findings of this study were: (1) the heterogeneity of reported outcomes across studies, (2) the inconsistency of the methodology of the included studies (3) an absence of meaningful effects of standalone nutritional countermeasure interventions on musculoskeletal and cardiovascular outcomes, with a tendency towards detrimental effects on specific muscle outcomes associated with power in the lower extremities. This systematic review highlights the limited amount of studies investigating the effect of nutrition as a standalone countermeasure on operationally relevant outcome parameters. Therefore, based on the data available from the included studies in this systematic review, it cannot be expected that nutrition alone will be effective in maintaining musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary integrity during space flight and bed rest.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>Prolonged exposure to microgravity (μg) leads to a range of adaptations affecting almost every physiological system in the human body [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary de-conditioning are of particular concern to spaceflight operations, since these systems are critical for astronaut health and wellbeing and potentially even safety and mission success. Consequently, space agencies employ in-flight exercise countermeasures as an integral part of long-duration international space station (ISS) (typically 6 months) space missions [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p>In space, muscles atrophy and lose both power and strength [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], particularly in the so-called ‘antigravity muscles’ such as the soleus [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the intrinsic back muscles [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As both an increase in protein breakdown and a decrease in anabolism can lead to a decrease in muscle mass [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], μg-induced loss of muscle mass is likely to be associated with space-related changes of whole-body protein turnover. In fact, studies indicate that during short-duration space flight whole body protein turnover increases, with a more pronounced increase in protein catabolism compared to protein synthesis leading to a net loss of protein [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, nutritional deficiencies including a reduction in caloric intake compared to pre-flight, commonly reported inflight, might attenuate maintenance of protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], thereby exacerbating μg-induced muscle deconditioning [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is supported by a long duration study from the Mir space station where it was observed that protein synthesis was directly correlated with energy intake [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
              <p>Bone loss during spaceflight is estimated to be approximately 1% per month, primarily affecting the weight-bearing bones, although there appears significant inter-individual variation between crewmembers [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, during space flight where the gravitational forces acting on bones are absent, increased bone resorption is not offset by augmentation of bone formation [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is either decreased or unchanged [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The relationship between nutrition and bone is complex involving several nutrients including protein required for bone synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, studies investigating the effect of high protein intake on bone health have been inconclusive [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and it has been speculated that excess protein intake may augment bone loss due to sulphur-containing amino acids reacting with bicarbonate stored in bone, thereby depleting its reservoirs [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
              <p>When exposed to μg the hydrostatic gradient associated with upright posture in Earth’s gravity is lost, and blood is redistributed towards the head and neck [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a result, on return to Earth astronauts can experience orthostatic intolerance, the incidence rate of which increases with mission duration [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Orthostatic intolerance is of particular concern as it constitutes a serious hazard for future planetary exploration missions where astronauts may spend a prolonged period in μg before entering a gravitational field of a celestial body (e.g. Mars) where they have to immediately perform mission-critical tasks without medical support [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, deficient energy intake has been correlated with cardiovascular deconditioning and a decrease in plasma volume during both bed rest–a ground-based analogue of space flight [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and space flight [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and has been shown to negatively affect orthostatic tolerance independent from bed rest [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, poor nutrition during space flight might also adversely affect cardiopulmonary outcomes by precipitating lean tissue loss leading to a reduction in metabolically active tissue, thereby directly reducing (peripheral) aerobic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Moreover, insufficient protein intake might augment a decrease in muscle mass negatively impacting exercise performance, and thus (indirectly) aerobic capacity [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, it has been suggested that cardiac mass and functional decrements associated with bed rest might be ameliorated by nutritional countermeasures [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p>
              <p>Despite the time, effort and resources consumed by current ISS exercise countermeasures they are unable to entirely ameliorate the undesirable effects of μg-exposure upon the musculoskeletal [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and cardiopulmonary systems [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, future space vehicles designed for deep spaceflight will have limited habitable volume including that for exercise countermeasures [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, in order to support crew health and wellbeing, safety, and to increase the likelihood of mission success, it is therefore critical to evaluate approaches to optimize both current and novel countermeasures to maintain musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary function inflight [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Typically crewmembers did not meet their recommended daily caloric intake which plays a role in subsequent loss of body and muscle mass [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This persistent inadequate intake is concerning as its effects will become increasingly severe as exploration missions lengthen. However, frequently the negative effects of dietary imbalance can be reversed by adequate nutrition. Interestingly when astronauts were able to meet their energy and vitamin-D intake requirements in addition to performing regular exercise it was reported that crewmembers returned to Earth with an unchanged body mass, increased lean tissue mass, reduced fat mass and maintained bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, it is currently unclear if any nutritional countermeasure alone can maintain integrity of the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems when humans are gravitationally unloaded. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence relating to the effectiveness of any nutritional countermeasures, as a standalone intervention, to ameliorate musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary deconditioning in gravitationally unloaded humans, either inflight or in long term ground-based analogues.</p>

              <p>This systematic review is part of a series performed by the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Space Medicine Team that seeks to evaluate the evidence relating to the effectiveness of active (e.g. resistive exercise), passive (e.g. centrifugation), and nutritional countermeasures for use in space flight, based on inflight data and ground-based analogues. This systematic review followed the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and tools created by the Aerospace Medicine Systematic Review Group (AMSRG) [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were used for data extraction, quality assessment of studies, and effect size calculations. Furthermore, this systematic review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

                <p>An initial literature search was performed by Fiebig and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] in November 2017 whom reported that resistive exercise may not always be sufficient in maintaining muscle strength and power during bed rest. This work has led to the seeding of a series of systematic reviews each with the objective of evaluating the evidence of a specific type of countermeasures, which in this case is nutrition on musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary outcomes that are operationally relevant to space missions. The search was performed using keywords, grouped into three overarching categories ‘microgravity’, ‘countermeasures’ and ‘operationally relevant outcome parameters’ (as defined by ESA’s Space Medicine Team) combined using Boolean logic in accordance with an overall search strategy (<xref rid="pone.0234412.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Two independent reviewers performed the initial screening that evaluated a countermeasure (active, passive or nutrition) during space flight, or in a ground-based space flight analogue. Then, two other independent reviewers screened the abstract and title for studies with a nutritional countermeasure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234412.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234412.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The full text version of the studies was then obtained and screened, and studies were included if the inclusion criteria (PICOS) were met (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234412.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the case of discrepancy between the two main reviewers, a third independent reviewer was employed to resolve any disagreements according to the inclusion criterion.</p>

                  <p>The quality of the bed rest methodology of the included studies was assessed using the purpose-built AMSRG tool [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] since the search yielded no studies employing any other ground-based analogue. The tool is based on eight criteria detailing how similar a study is to modelling the conditions associated with actual space flight–and thus the ‘quality’ of its ability to simulate the physiological effects of prolonged μg-exposure. The AMSRG assessment tool ranks the eight criteria from one (poor) to eight (excellent) depending on how many of the following criteria are met: (1) Number of bed rest days stated; (2) 6 degrees head down tilt; (3) individualised and controlled diet; (4) set daily routine with fixed wake/sleep time; (5) bed rest phases standardised for all participants; (6) uninterrupted bed rest except for test condition; (7) sunlight exposure prohibited; (8) all measures taken at the same day and time.</p>

                  <title>Data analysis</title>
                  <p>The quality of the included studies did not allow for a full meta-analysis as the data was too heterogeneous and would break with meta-analysis statistical assumptions. However, in order to provide an overall summary of the data extracted, for all studies containing data presented as means with standard deviations or standard errors, values of all relevant outcome measures effect sizes were calculated by the mean differences between the control and intervention group of pre and post intervention values and bias corrected using the Hedge’s G method [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] for small sample sizes, which is a common issue in studies of space flight and ground-based space flight analogues. All calculated effect sizes were defined as small (0.2), medium (0.5), large (0.8) or very large (1.3) as previously described by Rosenthal et al. [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and were presented in effect size plots with 95% confidence interval error bars. Outcomes were pooled according into the physiological systems they reflect: ‘muscle’, ‘bone’ and ‘cardiopulmonary’. Muscle outcomes were sub-divided into those that reflect: ‘muscle force’, ‘muscle power’, and ‘muscle volume’. All data representing a ‘positive’ effect in favour of the intervention are depicted on the right, and all data representing a ‘negative’ effect in favour of the control group are presented on the left of the line of no effect (i.e. 0) in effect size plots. For ease of interpretation, all outcomes were presented to show a ‘positive’ effect as being beneficial, therefore any original outcomes that have negative beneficial effects were inverted by multiplying by -1 for presentation in the overall results (e.g. a drop of resting heart rate results in a negative effect size but it is associated with better general physical fitness and thus is considered a beneficial outcome). All outcomes adjusted by this method are marked with a ‘hash’ (#). For otherwise qualified studies that did not strictly define a no intervention control group while examining the effect of differential energy intake, the group consuming the lower number of calories was characterized as the control group (vs. the interventional group consuming a greater number of calories). Data that could not be used to calculate Hedge’s G values (e.g. binary outcomes) were also extracted and are presented separately. For binary outcomes, finishing the test was considered a positive outcome, therefore more finishers in a results group was interpreted as results favouring that group.</p>

[<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] yielded a total of 4031 studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234412.g001">Fig 1</xref>). After removing duplicates, 2695 studies were left. After screening title and abstract of those 2695 studies, further 2333 studies were excluded, resulting in 278 studies. The 278 studies were then, after another screening with two additional reviewers who screened title and abstracts, divided into three subgroups: passive, active and nutritional countermeasures. The subgroup of nutritional countermeasures for analysis in this systematic review contained a total of 21 studies. After obtaining and reading the full-text versions of these 21 studies, seven studies were excluded because of the wrong study design, one study was excluded due to being a duplicate and three studies were excluded because of incomplete presentation of data, resulting in a total of 10 studies suitable for inclusion.</p>

                <title>Characteristics of included studies</title>
                <p>Nine of the included studies were randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT) whilst a single study was a non-randomized controlled clinical trial (CT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234412.s002">S1 Table</xref>). All included studies employed bed rest for durations of between 14 and 60 days as the ground-based analogue to simulate the physiological effects of μg. No actual μg-study met the criteria to be included in this systematic review. A total of 67 participants were included across the studies, 16 of whom were women. The mean number of participants across all studies was 15 (SD = 3) with a mean age of 31 (SD = 6). Six of the included studies incorporated data from the same WISE experimental campaign in Toulouse, France [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Two of the ten studies presented binary outcomes in the form of the amount of finishers and non-finishers of an orthostatic tolerance test [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Across all the studies, 52 outcome parameters were reported consistent with our inclusion strategy (see <xref rid="pone.0234412.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234412.s002">S1 Table</xref>). All studies had a separate control group that did not receive any countermeasure, except for the single CT study that used the same population for intervention and control separated by at least 5 months [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Six of the included studies reported muscle, two bone [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and four cardiopulmonary outcomes. Each specific outcome was only reported once, with the exception of number of ‘finishers’ after an orthostatic tolerance test that was reported by two independent studies employing different methods [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The main findings of this study were: (1) substantial heterogeneity of reported outcomes across studies, (2) the inconsistent quality of methods used to minimize risk of bias and methodology of bed rest in the included studies, and (3) an absence of evidence for meaningful effects in favour of standalone nutritional countermeasure interventions on musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary outcomes during 14 to 60 days of bed-rest ground-based analogues, with a tendency towards detrimental effects on specific muscle outcomes associated with power in the lower extremities.</p>
              <p>The present data demonstrate an absence of meaningful effects when nutritional countermeasures were used as a standalone intervention during bed rest to ameliorate the adverse effects of μg on the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems. Moreover, this systematic review was unable to find eligible in flight-data from astronauts or any other ground-based space flight analogues than bed rest for inclusion that met the pre-specified inclusion criteria (PICOS). As a result, only bed rest studies were included. Six of the 10 included studies reported data from the WISE 2005 campaign investigating the effects of 60 days of 6 degrees head down bed rest in 24 women of which only the 16 women assigned to the nutrition and control groups were evaluated in this systematic review. The WISE 2005 campaign was investigating how the physiology of women might adapt to space flight and to test the ability of nutrition as a standalone countermeasure and exercise against the expected physiological adaptations associated with bed rest. The remaining four studies analysed in this systematic review were highly heterogeneous in terms of sample sizes, gender composition, the nature of the nutritional countermeasures tested, and the duration of bed rest. The investigated outcomes across all included studies (including the WISE 2005 studies) were highly heterogeneous with no specific outcomes tested more than once, with the exception of orthostatic tolerance that was investigated by two independent studies using slightly different methods [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>

                <title>Quality of evidence and overall completeness</title>
                <p>The present systematic review sought to investigate physiological outcomes in the domains of musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems with a demonstrable space flight operational relevance (as defined by operational experts of ESA’s Space Medicine Team). However, only a small proportion of the pre-defined operationally relevant outcomes (See <xref rid="pone.0234412.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234412.s002">S1 Table</xref>) were presented in the included studies. Moreover, the reporting of outcomes of the included studies was rather poor. Every included study reported a unique set of physiological outcomes. The absence of a standard data set across studies prevented data pooling and meta-analysis, therefore current findings and operational space medicine recommendations are based on single studies that could be flawed or biased, rather than a number of repeated and standardised studies. The overall statistical power of the findings is, therefore, limited and again could be improved by conducting repeated homogenous studies that would increase the overall total sample size when pooled.</p>

                  <title>Bed rest methodology</title>
                  <p>Bed rest studies seek to simulate μg and its impact on human physiology as close as possible to the actual μg environment in space and it has been concluded that head down bed rest is a valid simulation model for most physiological effects of spaceflight [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Bed rest is an established terrestrial analogue for axial unloading. Compared to actual space flight, bed rest studies have the advantage that they have fewer confounding factors, and bed rest provides the most common method to investigate the effectiveness of nutritional spaceflight countermeasures [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The bed rest methodology of included studies was good with most studies matching the “ideal design” of a bed rest study [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, all studies failed to address whether sunlight exposure was prohibited which is problematic as sunlight exposure stimulates vitamin D synthesis that might itself act as a countermeasure [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and potentially affect the physiological systems investigated in this systematic review. However, vitamin D supplementation has been tested in actual space flight and it was found that it was inefficient to ameliorate bone loss in space [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, seven out of 10 studies did not report set daily routine with fixed wake/sleep time for all participant which might impact musculoskeletal and cardiovascular outcomes as sleep affects muscle strength [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and athletic performance [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Overall most aspects of the assumed “ideal design” of bed rest such as stating the number of days for bed rest and the use of 6 degree head down tilt were met and the data can be considered transferable to actual astronauts in the μg environment of space. However, despite the high methodological quality of the included studies, bed rest is not a perfect method to simulate the actual space flight environment as it does not eliminate the influence of gravity and fails to remove the loading G-vector from the chest to the back [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting results exclusively based on bed rest studies and applying them to actual space flight situations, as it has been suggested that bed rest might be a less reliable analogue for important physiological parameters such as spinal dysfunction and fluids shifts which might affect the cardiopulmonary outcomes such as orthostatic tolerance and HR investigated in the current systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>

                  <title>Risk of bias</title>
                  <p>Overall, the risk of bias of the included studies was high, with seven of the studies reporting incomplete outcome data and/or reporting selective outcomes. Eight of the nine included RCTs failed to sufficiently describe the randomization of the participants [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and Lee et al. [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] described a non-random component in the sequence generation. In addition, all included studies failed to sufficiently describe methods for allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment. The overall high risk of bias of the included studies highlights the need for a better standardization of bed rest studies investigating nutritional countermeasures. As a result of the high risk of bias, as well as the heterogeneous study designs and outcomes of the included studies, findings of the present systematic review have to be interpreted with caution. The overall quality of evidence of the included studies could be improved by providing more methodological information addressing the Cochrane criteria for risk of bias [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>

                <title>For effects of nutritional interventions on muscle outcomes</title>
                <p>In the current systematic review, LPD was the only nutritional countermeasure intervention leading to meaningful effects on any of the investigated outcomes across the investigated physiological systems. The effects of LPD on muscle parameters were limited to only one outcome (Po/CSA MHC) showing a significant positive effect [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In contrast, supine squat work, supine squat concentric peak power, peak power MHC IIa, peak force MHC IIa and calf press work showed a negative effect of LPD. The remaining 26 outcomes showed no effect of any of investigated nutritional countermeasure interventions at all. Interestingly, five of the six outcomes demonstrating an effect of LPD were in the group of 11 investigated muscle power outcomes, two of which showed a large negative effect and two which showed a very large negative effect, whereas only one outcome showed a large positive effect of LPD. This suggests that LPD had a negative effect on four out of the 11 specific muscle outcomes associated with power investigated in this systematic review. However, all these data are derived from the same participants in the 2005 WISE campaign [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and, therefore, these results must be interpreted cautiously. Overall, protein and amino acid supplementation are the most extensively investigated nutritional countermeasure (LPD being evaluated in 45 of the 52 outcomes in this study) against muscular deconditioning in unloaded humans [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The efficacy of protein and amino acid supplementation to mitigate the physiological effects on muscle integrity and function caused by μg-exposure are inconclusive, with studies showing diverging results with no clear effects [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, some studies suggested that protein supplementation has no additional protective effect upon muscle mass and function when energy and protein consumption are adequate [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The findings of the current systematic review go beyond this, suggesting that leucine might have a negative effect on power and force muscle outcomes. In fact, a recent critical review reinforced this, as the authors concluded that leucine as a standalone countermeasure intervention is ineffective against muscle loss [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Interestingly, however, a novel amino acid composition has shown the ability to preserve muscle mass during muscle disuse-induced atrophy by unilateral knee immobilization in young men (43) but has yet to be tested in actual space flight or space flight analogues. The current systematic review does not, however, provide any support for amino acids (LPD) having a positive effect on muscle health during unloading. In conclusion, this systematic review does not support a beneficial effect of the tested standalone nutritional interventions to protect muscles from deconditioning in simulated μg, in fact there is even a tendency towards detrimental effects on specific muscle outcomes associated with power in the lower extremities.</p>

                <title>Effects of nutritional interventions on bone outcomes</title>
                <p>None of the 14 investigated outcomes showed an effect of standalone nutritional countermeasures. However, the relatively weak effect of bed rest that was observed in the two investigated studies on BMD and BMC [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] limits the sensitivity to any potential amelioration of nutritional countermeasure interventions [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, no conclusions of the effect of LPD or amino acids plus carbohydrates on bone can be drawn from the included studies. In the scientific literature the effect of nutritional countermeasures on bone have revealed diverging results depending on the population and concurrent dietary intake of other nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Negative effects of protein supplementation observed on bone have been suggested to result from sulphur-containing amino acids increasing bone resorption and/or induction of metabolic acidosis depleting skeletal bicarbonate stores, and thus bone mass [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, it has been proposed that high protein diets containing sulphuric acids should be provided with base precursors to counteract the adverse effects [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, the current systematic review did not report any data supporting any protective effect of standalone nutritional interventions on bone properties in simulated μg.</p>

[<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], LPD had a large negative effect on HR when standing, but no effect when measured in supine position. Bosutti et al. [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] found no effect of the intervention when investigating protein plus KHCO<sub>3</sub> on VO<sub>2</sub>max [L/min/kg] and VO<sub>2</sub>max [L/min]. It has been proposed that protein might be able to mitigate the decline in VO<sub>2</sub>peak observed after space flight by mitigating the concurrent cardiac muscle atrophy observed after space-flight and bed rest [<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0234412.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, this finding is not supported in the results of this systematic review. As such, the available data do not support any protective effect of standalone nutritional interventions on cardiovascular properties in simulated μg.</p>
                <p>Overall, this systematic review found little evidence supporting the effect of any standalone nutritional countermeasures to mitigate physiological adaptations on operationally relevant musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary parameters during exposure to μg.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>The main findings of this study were: (1) the heterogeneity of reported outcomes across studies, (2) the inconsistency of the methodology of the included studies, and (3) an absence of meaningful effects of standalone nutritional countermeasure interventions on musculoskeletal and cardiovascular outcomes, with a tendency towards detrimental effects on specific muscle outcomes associated with power in the lower extremities. This, however, does not mean that nutritional countermeasures may have no effect on operationally relevant outcomes at all as nutritional countermeasures may affect the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems differently when combined with other countermeasures such as resistance exercise. This systematic review, rather, highlights the paucity of data investigating the effect of nutrition as a standalone countermeasure on operationally relevant outcome parameters of the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems. Based on the evidence of the included studies, it cannot be expected that nutrition alone will be effective in maintaining musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary integrity in response to gravitational unloading.</p>

              <p>PLOS ONE</p>
              <p>Dear Dr Weber,</p>
              <p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE.

              <p>Additional Editor Comments:</p>
              <p>In this manuscript, Dr. Weber and colleagues performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of nutritional countermeasure to ameliorate the physiological challenges of the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems in microgravity conditions necessary to maintain human health during space flight missions. The survey concluded that nutrition alone cannot be expected to be an effective countermeasure in maintaining musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary integrity during space flight and bed rest. The authors have performed systematic review with a thorough background literature. Specific comments to further improve the manuscript are as follow.</p>
              <p>Title- The authors may consider rephrasing the title for a review article- “Nutritional countermeasures to musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary challenges in microgravity conditions”.</p>
              <p>They have conducted a Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of data. They have used PRISMA 2009 flow diagram. I suggest the authors to verify the journal policy and using statistical methods appropriately. Also, improve the quality of all figures provided. Fig.1 legend, please provide ref#35 for Fiebig et al 2018 noted.</p>
              <p>References: Please remove the repeated information for references provided ex., Ref#21: “Available from:----------” verify complete details for Ref#37 “AMSRG Data extraction form v2. 2017” following a journal article for citations listed.</p>
              <p>Although the Methods section include Data analysis, I suggest providing details in legends with for Figures 1-4 with statistical methods and significance data (p.15); also, details in legends for “Supporting information” data provided.</p>

              <p>Thank you. We have done as suggested.</p>
              <p>Comments from Dr Prof Banerjee:</p>
              <p>Dear Professor Banerjee,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your helpful suggestions and comments. Please find your comments highlighted in red color, followed by our answers in black color below. All changes in the revised manuscript have been highlighted using the track changes function in word.</p>
              <p>In this manuscript, Dr Weber and colleagues performed a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of nutritional countermeasure to ameliorate the physiological challenges of the musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary systems in microgravity conditions necessary to maintain human health during space flight missions. The survey concluded that nutrition alone cannot be expected to be an effective countermeasure in maintaining musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary integrity during space flight and bed rest. The authors have performed systematic review with a thorough background literature. Specific comments to further improve the manuscript are as follow.</p>
              <p>� Thank you for your thorough review!</p>
              <p>Title- The authors may consider rephrasing the title for a review article- “Nutritional countermeasures to musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary challenges in microgravity conditions”.</p>
              <p>� Thanks for proposing a new title. However, the authors of the present manuscript feel that the original title better reflects study design and purpose of the study, so we decided to keep the title as it is.</p>
              <p>They have conducted a Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of data. They have used PRISMA 2009 flow diagram. I suggest the authors to verify the journal policy and using statistical methods appropriately. </p>
              <p>� Thank you for highlighting this, and apologies if this was not clear. We have not done a full meta-analysis due to the high heterogeneity of study designs and outcomes. More precisely, we did not do a meta-analysis, as either the RCT/CT data was too heterogeneous, or there were only within participant designs which would break the meta analysis statistical assumptions. However, to still provide an overall summary, we converted all included data to effect sizes in standardised units to give an overall comparable summary of the evidence base as it stands today. In conclusion, we have used statistical methods appropriately and the present methodology is in line with the highest standards available for systematic literature reviews (Cochrane guidelines). We have added a sentence to the data analysis section to make this clear. </p>
              <p>Also, improve the quality of all figures provided. Fig.1 legend, please provide ref#35 for Fiebig et al 2018 noted.</p>
              <p>� Thank you. We have done as suggested. </p>

              <p>� Thank you. We have verified this and revised the references in the bibliography. </p>
