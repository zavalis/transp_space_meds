              <abstract>
                <p>In recent years there has been an increasing use of satellite Earth observation (EO) data in dengue research, in particular the identification of landscape factors affecting dengue transmission. Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed. The proposed semi-supervised text classification framework was successfully applied in research evidence synthesis that could be easily applied to other topics, particularly in an interdisciplinary context.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>According to the World Health Organism (WHO), dengue affects over half of the global population, with an estimated 100–400 million infections each year worldwide [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, dengue has been transmitted to new geographical areas in the world, and dengue epidemics are increasing in frequency and magnitude [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
              <p>The spatial concentration and diffusion of dengue vectors/cases can be affected by weather conditions and landscape factors (e.g., vegetation, transport, urbanization) at different spatial scales (e.g., global, regional, and local scales) [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The advances in satellite Earth observation (EO) readily benefit the identification of dengue landscape factors by providing a better monitoring of the Earth’s surface at different spatio-temporal scales, and entomological/epidemiological dengue risk mapping benefits from the use of satellite EO data [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In practice, satellite EO data, combined with weather data, can be used to predict the likelihood of future dengue epidemics so that preventative measures can be taken in advance, such as eliminating mosquito-breeding sites. Compared with weather factors, landscape factors are often more complex as landscape is often related to the vectorial capacity through vector resting and breeding sites, human–vector encounters or human mobility in different geographic contexts and at different spatial scales [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several important reviews have covered such information, for example, Parselia et al. [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] proposed a scoping review that identified studies using satellite EO data for epidemiological modeling of malaria, dengue and West Nile Virus (WNV) published from 2012 to 2018. However, only 15 studies were identified for dengue where satellite EO data were used to identify meteorological and environmental factors. Sallam et al. [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] proposed a systematic review that summarized land cover, meteorological and socioeconomic factors of <italic>Aedes</italic> habitats, referring to dengue vectors. Moreover, our previous mapping review [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] focused on the dengue transmission in urban landscapes, and urban landscape factors derived from satellite EO data, Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and survey questionnaires; spatial scales and dengue–landscape relationships were identified from 78 relevant studies published from inception to 31 December 2019. Despite all this, there is still a lack of overview on satellite EO data and landscape factors that could be of benefit to science and society by guiding future studies of disease risk prediction and improving health decision-making at different spatial scales (e.g., from global to local).</p>
              <p>Information updates can be simply conducted by re-running the process of review, which would mainly include defining the research question, searching for and removing duplicates, title abstract screening, full-text eligibility and inclusion [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the selection of relevant studies is time-consuming and is highly dependent on the perception of reviewers, especially for title abstract screening and full-text eligibility. Under such constrained circumstances, text classification appears particularly relevant. As a typical topic in natural language processing (NLP), multiple algorithms in text classification have proved to be efficient in replacing the manual evaluation of bibliographic records (e.g., titles and/or abstracts) and reducing human workload, such as term weighting [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) based on convolutional neutral networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used in text classification [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since text classification can be considered as one sequential modelling task, RNNs have been used more frequently because of their specificity for sequential modelling tasks [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One kind of RNN, the long short-term memory (LSTM) performs well in text classification because it can effectively solve the problems of exploding and vanishing gradients and capture long-term dependencies in text [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is a development of the LSTM and combines forward hidden and backward hidden layers that often work better than LSTM in text classification [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, when applying the algorithms above, we need to label sufficiently good-quality samples for training and validating models, which is quite time-consuming. However, deep active learning (DAL), integrating active learning (AL) in DL architecture, is able to achieve text classification based on few labelled data which can minimize the work of human labelling [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It would seem to be more appropriate to implement text classification based on a new bibliographic dataset for selecting relevant records, while the labelled data derived from active learning could be used as training data to train the DL architecture [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p>
              <p>In this context, focusing on landscape factors affecting dengue transmission and satellite EO data currently used for identifying landscape factors, this study proposes to build a semi-supervised classification framework of literature by integrating the review process and text classification algorithms and provides an overview of dengue landscape factors and satellite EO data. The proposed framework allows for rational and effective selection of literature relevant to our objective from bibliographic databases.</p>

              <title>2. Towards a Semi-Supervised Classification Framework of Literature</title>
              <p>The framework of semi-supervised text classification integrating the review process and semi-automatic text classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04509-f001">Figure 1</xref>), includes: (1) defining the research question and specifying the inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.1</xref>); (2) conducting a board search and removing the duplicates (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.2</xref>); (3) screening titles and abstracts based on text scoring (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.3</xref>); (4) preparing relevant and irrelevant samples, and conducting the BiLSTM-based active learning (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot4-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.4</xref>); (5) verifying the performance of text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot5-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.5</xref>); and (6) extracting dengue landscape factors and satellite EO data and charting the results (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot6-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.6</xref>).</p>
              <p>To implement the text scoring in step 3, it is necessary to remove the records that are definitively irrelevant to our topic, which also reduces the amount of data for the BiLSTM-based active learning in step 4. It should be noted that the BiLSTM model was developed and implemented based on titles and abstracts that are different from the full-text assessment in the eligibility step of the review. The detailed information is presented hereafter and no ethics approval is needed as this method is based on published journal articles.</p>

                <p>The objective of this study is to provide an overview on landscape factors related to dengue transmission and satellite EO data used in the identification of dengue landscape factors. Relevant records should satisfy the following criteria: (1) being an original journal article published in English; (2) highlighting landscape factors derived from satellite EO data or geographic information system (GIS) techniques; (3) being applied to dengue cases or dengue vectors; (4) modelling or correlating dengue with landscape factors. These were defined based on our objective and expert knowledge, and were used for text scoring and record sample selection for BiLSTM models.</p>

                <title>2.3. Text Scoring</title>
                <p>To efficiently eliminate the definitely-irrelevant records, we used text weighting and text scoring for ranking all the records. First, we pre-set some terms KEY<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> (<italic>i</italic> = 1, …, m) and their priority levels (i.e., high, medium and low) (<xref rid="ijerph-17-04509-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) according to the criteria in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.1</xref>. Each of them was randomly assigned a weight value WEIGHT<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> (<italic>i</italic> = 1, …, m) from the interval of weights that was set according to its priority level. The higher the priority level of a term, the greater its weight value. We then extracted the key terms K<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> (<italic>j</italic> = 1, …, n) and their corresponding weight values W<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> (<italic>j</italic> = 1, 2, …, n) from the title and abstract using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. If K<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> contains pre-set terms in KEY<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, we calculated the score of a record as Score = <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mstyle mathsize="70%" displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:msup><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>WEIGHT</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>*</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (i = 1, …, m; j = 1, …, n). For example, through keyword extraction using NLTK, a bibliographic record has two key terms “dengue” and “satellite”, and their weights are W(dengue) and W(satellite). According to <xref rid="ijerph-17-04509-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the weights of these two terms were randomly assigned to 8 and 5. In this case, the score of this text is W (dengue)*8 + W (satellite)*5.</p>
                <p>All the records were then ranked in decreasing order according to the scores, and the top 1000 records were selected and merged into a subset denoted as U<italic><sub>k</sub></italic>. Finally, we iterated the second step 20 times, and the records in the 20 subsets U<italic><sub>k</sub></italic> (<italic>k</italic> = 1, …, 20) were combined together, and were used for the next analysis. It should be noted that random assignment of weights allows multiple iterations of text scoring that should make the results more reliable.</p>

Meanwhile, we improved the training dataset by combining the selected relevant records and previous relevant samples, and randomly selected irrelevant records from the results of text scoring in order to keep the ratio of relevant and irrelevant samples at 1:2. Finally, the BiLSTM model was re-trained using the new training dataset to identify the potential citations from the remaining unlabelled data. The parameters of the BiLSTM architecture were updated by training the results from the previous round. BiLSTM learning and active learning were alternately implemented until we could not find any relevant records.</p>

A total of 13,893 bibliographic records were obtained after the broad search, and 7696 records were included after the removal of duplicates. Then, based on text scoring, we identified 2034 possible records, and 131 records were included after the BiLSTM-based active learning that met the inclusion criteria in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-ijerph-17-04509">Section 2.1</xref>. Finally, by reading the full texts, we included 101 articles (see more details in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-ijerph-17-04509">Appendix C</xref>). The non-English articles (e.g., Chinese, Spanish and Portuguese) and non-journal articles (e.g., book chapters, reviews or conference papers) were excluded.</p>
                <p><xref rid="ijerph-17-04509-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the results of each cycle of BiLSTM-based active learning. Evidently, all the relevant records were identified after the fourth cycle. Throughout the process of semi-supervised text classification, we manually evaluated 1056 titles/abstracts (<xref rid="ijerph-17-04509-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p>
                <p>Moreover, the accurate and rational identification of relevant records can be indicated by the following two facts. First, no relevant records were found by manually evaluating the records selected randomly from the unlabelled dataset (i.e., 925 records after BiLSTM-based active learning). This indicated a good performance of the semi-supervised text classification. Second, although each record probably received different scores in 20 text scoring experiments, the number of relevant records per score rank interval showed a consistent decreasing trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04509-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This indicated the rationality of text scoring using the preset terms and priority levels, that is, the more relevant a record is to the topic question, the greater the possibility it will receive a high score.</p>
                <p>The accurate and rational identification of relevant records can be explained by the facts: (1) A clear topic was defined. In fact, modelling or correlating dengue epidemiological or entomological variables with landscape factors in different geographic contexts often includes the identification of landscape factors, landscape characterization and spatio-temporal analysis of dengue cases or vectors. This interdisciplinary topic provides evident features that meet the definition of appropriate inclusion criteria. These criteria then help to define terms and priority levels for text scoring and active learning. (2) The union of the results of 20 text scoring experiments enable the inclusion of potential records as much as possible, and greatly exclude the irrelevant records. (3) BiLSTM has proved to be especially useful in understanding the context of words [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and active learning based on clear and appropriate inclusion criteria allows for the accurate selection of relevant records and for the control of the balance of positive and negative samples in training datasets for each cycle in BiLSTM learning. Moreover, it should be noted that other models are possible, such as BiLSTM with attention mechanism (AC-BiLSTM) [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or a combination of CNN and LSTM (C-LSTM) [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which might generate a high accuracy of text classification.</p>

                <p>Among the 101 included articles, only 64 studies used satellite EO data. <xref rid="ijerph-17-04509-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the satellite EO sensors, derived products and spatio-temporal resolutions used for identifying dengue landscape factors in selected studies. Evidently, for LU/LC mapping, most studies used very fine (i.e., pixel size &lt; 10 m) and fine (i.e., 10 m ≤ pixel size &lt; 100 m) spatial resolution data, including multi-spectral bands derived from Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Indian Remote-Sensing Satellite-P6 (IRS-P6), Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre 4 (SPOT-4), Sentinel-2, GaoFen-1, SPOT-5, Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), IKONOS and Quickbird. For topographic factors, two global scale and freely available digital elevation models (DEMs) at resolutions of 30 m and 90 m from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) mission were used to extract topographic features. For continuous land surface features, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products with coarse resolution (i.e., 1000 m ≤ pixel size &lt; 10,000 m) and moderate resolution (i.e., 100 m ≤ pixel size &lt; 1000 m) were widely used to characterize them. In addition, some EO data with fine resolution (i.e., 10 m ≤ pixel size &lt; 100 m) have also made a contribution, such as data from Landsat 5, 7 and 8, SPOT 5 and GeoFen-1.</p>
                <p>Although satellite EO sensors and products are pointed out, we do not explain what should be considered while choosing satellite EO data, and making effective use of them. This is an important issue, especially for non-specialized users. Hamm et al. [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] proposed that spatio-temporal scales, uncertainty, spatial quality of EO data and the interaction between uncertainty in EO and disease data should be considered when using EO data for the study of neglected tropical diseases (NTD) (e.g., echinococcosis, schistosomiasis and leptospirosis). This is useful for evaluating EO data in dengue research.</p>

                <p>LU/LC mapping has continued to be an important research area in recent years, in particular urban LU/LC mapping. Gong et al. [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] proposed the two-level essential urban land use categories (EULUC) and archived the preliminary results of 30 m in China for 2018 using Sentinel-2 images, Luojia night time light data, mobile phone locating request data and point of interests (POI) data. According to our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-04509-f003">Figure 3</xref>), EULUC classes were mostly related to dengue transmission (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial and transportation). Global essential urban land use maps with fine spatial resolution could be useful for landscape-related studies of dengue. Moreover, developing LU/LC maps and integrating them for dengue research in tropical and subtropical regions is difficult due to the presence of clouds and cloud shadows. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images could penetrate such barriers and have recently been used for vector-borne disease application [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, we found no specific study that used SAR data in dengue research. Third, deep learning frameworks have been increasingly used to predict dengue outbreaks.

              <title>5. Conclusions</title>
              <p>Satellite EO has been increasingly used in dengue research over the past years, especially for the identification of dengue landscape factors. During that time, various types of landscape factors were considered while the study areas and research objectives have become more complex, and the variety and volume of satellite EO data have been growing over these years. There is an increasing need to know what dengue landscape factors have been studied and what dengue landscape factors have been derived from satellite EO data during the past years. In this study, by integrating the review process, AL mechanism, text scoring and BiLSTM model, we propose a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient evaluation of bibliographic records derived from bibliographic databases and accurately selects the articles relevant to the research objective. In this study, 101 relevant articles were efficiently selected from bibliographic databases using the proposed approach. Among them, 64 articles used satellite EO data. Valuable information on dengue landscape factors and current satellite EO data was reported. A catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors were identified that were divided into four categories: LU, LC, topography and continuous land surface features. These factors were considered as the direct or indirect proxies of <italic>Aedes</italic> breeding and resting sites, human–Aedes encounters, human mobility and virus replication in dengue transmission. Moreover, future research directions on how to integrate satellite EO data in dengue research were proposed in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning. This study is an important step towards an efficient method for research evidence synthesis that could be easily applied to other topics, particularly in an interdisciplinary context.</p>

                <p>Word2Vec [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-04509" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] is based on deep learning, which could learn grammar and semantic information from a large amount of unlabelled data. Word2Vec Continuous Bag-Of-Words Model (CBOW) model maps each word to a V-dimensional word vector by training, and can calculate the similarity between word vectors to represent the semantic similarity of the text. Word2Vec CBOW architecture predicts the current word based on the context. The input layer here is composed of one-hot encoded input contexts <italic>X1</italic>,...,<italic>Xc</italic>, where the window size is <italic>C</italic>, the glossary size is <italic>V</italic> and the hidden layer is an N-dimensional vector. The final output layer is the output word y that is also encoded by one-hot. The input vector encoded by one-hot is connected to the hidden layer by a <italic>V × N</italic>-dimensional weight matrix <italic>W</italic> and the hidden layer is connected to the output layer by an <italic>N × V</italic> weight matrix <italic>W′</italic>.</p>

                <p>Generally, LSTM-based RNNs consist of three gates: one input gate it with corresponding weight matrix <italic>W<sub>xi</sub></italic>, <italic>W<sub>hi</sub></italic>, <italic>W<sub>ci</sub></italic>, <italic>bi</italic>; one forget gate <italic>f<sub>t</sub></italic> with corresponding weight matrix <italic>W<sub>xf</sub></italic>, <italic>W<sub>hf</sub></italic>, <italic>W<sub>cf</sub></italic><sub>,</sub>
<italic>bf</italic>; one output gate <italic>ot</italic> with corresponding weight matrix <italic>W<sub>xo</sub></italic>, <italic>W<sub>ho</sub></italic>, <italic>W<sub>co</sub></italic>, <italic>bo</italic>. The operation can be summarized as the process of forgetting old information and memorizing new information in the state of the cell, so that information useful for subsequent process operations is passed, and useless information is discarded. The hidden layer state hi is output at each time step. In the process, all gates are set to generate some parameters, using current input <italic>xi</italic>, the state <italic>hi</italic>-1 that the previous step generated, and current state of this cell <italic>ci</italic>-1 (peephole), for the decisions whether to take the inputs, forget the memory stored before, and output the state generated later. The computation can be explained by the following equations:<disp-formula id="FD1-ijerph-17-04509"><label>(A1)</label><mml:math id="mm2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>
