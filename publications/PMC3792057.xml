              <abstract>
                <p>In order to study the effect of microgravity on the proliferation of mammalian osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts, the changes in cell proliferation, spindle structure, expression of MAD2 or BUB1, and effect of MAD2 or BUB1 on the inhibition of cell proliferation is investigated by keeping mammalian osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts under simulated microgravity in a rotating wall vessel (2D-RWVS) bioreactor. Experimental results indicate that the effect of microgravity on proliferation inhibition, incidence of multipolar spindles, and expression of MAD2 or BUB1 increases with the extension of treatment time. And multipolar cells enter mitosis after MAD2 or BUB1 is knocked down, which leads to the decrease in DNA content, and decrease the accumulation of cells within multipolar spindles. It can therefore be concluded that simulated microgravity can alter the structure of spindle microtubules, and stimulate the formation of multipolar spindles together with multicentrosomes, which causes the overexpression of SAC proteins to block the abnormal cells in metaphase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. By clarifying the relationship between cell proliferation inhibition, spindle structure and SAC changes under simulated microgravity, the molecular mechanism and morphology basis of proliferation inhibition induced by microgravity is revealed, which will give experiment and theoretical evidence for the mechanism of space bone loss and some other space medicine problems.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p>The effect of microgravity on the proliferation of osteoblasts has attracted much attention from the research community in recent years because of its great importance for the mechanism of space bone loss and some other space medicine problems. Much work has been done on the effect of microgravity on proliferation of osteoblasts. For example, X.Y. Zhang et al. found in 2000 that by increasing the number of cells in G1 phase and reducing the number of cells in G2/M phase, simulated microgravity can obviously inhibit cell proliferation <xref rid="pone.0076710-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. P. Kossmehl et al. reported in 2003 that weightlessness induced apoptosis in normal thyoid cells and papillary thyoidcarcinoma cells via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways <xref rid="pone.0076710-Kossmehl1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. X.G. Wang et al. noticed in 2013 that miR-214 targets <italic>ATF4</italic> to inhibit bone formation <xref rid="pone.0076710-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, the relation between cell proliferation regulation and change in cell structure needs further study before a very good understanding of the mechanism of cell proliferation regulation can be achieved. It is learnt through previous work that simulated microgravity can also induce the rearrangement, or even depolymerization of cytoskeleton of human cells <xref rid="pone.0076710-Burvakova1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0076710-Xiong1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. And the relation between the change in cytoskeleton and the cell proliferation is still an open question. Therefore, we tried to study the effect of simulated microgravity on the change in spindle structure and the proliferation inhabitation of mammalian osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts by keeping them in a rotating wall vessel (2D-RWVS) bioreactor.</p>
              <p>Osteoblasts are mechanosensitive, and they can sense small deformations through their attachment sites <xref rid="pone.0076710-Zhang2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Recent studies confirmed that intact microtubules are needed for the load-induced proliferation and differentiation <xref rid="pone.0076710-Liedert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The change in cytoskeleton under microgravity may occur in a sounding rocket <xref rid="pone.0076710-Rijken1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0076710-Rijken2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, during parabolic flight <xref rid="pone.0076710-Guignandon1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, in a spacecraft <xref rid="pone.0076710-HughesFulford1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>â<xref rid="pone.0076710-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, or under simulated microgravity on ground <xref rid="pone.0076710-Lewis2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Mouse oocyte maturation is impaired under simulated microgravity because microtubules and chromosomes can not form a complete spindle during oocyte meiotic maturation <xref rid="pone.0076710-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. However, whether there is a change in the spindle structure in somatic cells under simulated microgravity, and the regulatory mechanism of that process have not been fully clarified yet so far.</p>
              <p>Spindle is a special structure of microtubules associated with the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Microtubules and other proteins can assemble themselves into a structure consisting of cilia, flagella, matrix, centrosome, and spindle, etc. Centrosome and spindle can form a mitotic apparatus, and the integrity of a spindle determines the accuracy of chromosome segregation in space and time, which is related to the maintenance of chromosome stability <xref rid="pone.0076710-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A change in spindle structure takes place in 3T3 cells after they are put under simulated microgravity for 72 hours <xref rid="pone.0076710-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The defects in spindle structure can be detected by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). MAD2 and BUBl are the main components of a SAC signaling pathway. Their expressions will increase to cause a cell cycle arrest when the spindle structure becomes abnormal. The deletion of either <italic>Mad2</italic> or <italic>Bub1</italic> can cause severe chromosome missegregation to further increase the chromosomal instability <xref rid="pone.0076710-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0076710-Malmanche1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p>
              <p>On the basis of these findings, we assumed that microtubules can feel the change in tension and alter the spindle structure, and any change in the spindle structure can cause a change in the SAC expression, which results in a cell cycle arrest and proliferation inhibition. This study provides support for the above hypothesis.</p>

                <title>Cultures of Osteosarcoma Cells and Osteoblasts</title>
                <p>Only five cell lines are now used for the present study. Osteosarcoma cells are MG-63,U-2 OS and Saos-2, osteoblasts-like cells with high chromosome instability and osteoblasts are hFOB1.19 and rat calvaria primary osteoblast with less chromosome instability. All these cells are model cell lines commonly used for space bone loses and other space medicine problems. MG-63, U-2 OS, Saos-2 and hFOB1.19 are all purchased from ATCC. MG-63 cells are cultured in DMEM (Gibco-BRL) with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FBS, Gibco-BRL). U-2 OS cells are cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, BRL) with 20% (v/v) FBS (Gibco-BRL). Saos-2 cells are cultured in DMEM and Hamâs F12 (Gibco-BRL) with 20% (v/v) FBS (Gibco-BRL). All the media is supplemented with antibiotics (streptomycin 100 Âµg/ml; penicillinG 100 U/ml). All the cells are incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Human osteoblasts cell line hFOB1.19 was transfected with SV40 large T antigen and cultured in DMEM and Hamâs F12 (Gibco-BRL) prepared at a ratio of 1â¶1 with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (without phenol red), 0.3 mg/ml G418, and 10% FBS (Gibco-BRL).

When the gravity direction changing interval is shorter than the minimum response time (MRT) of a cell, the effect of gravity does not work, and instead it produces an effect similar to that under microgravity.</p>
                <p>Rotating Wall Vessel (2D-RWVS) bioreactor is used to create different culture conditions for this study, and it was originally developed by China Astronaut Research and Training Center. This two-directional, multi-sample cell experimental device can be used to investigate the effect of simulated microgravity on the ground <xref rid="pone.0076710-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The cells are seeded over a cover slip (22Ã26Ã0.5 mm) and cultured on the slip for 24 hours. The slip is then transferred into the bioreactor of 0.04 m in diameter filled with growth medium. According to equipment manual and reference, the samples are rotated around the horizontal axis at 30 rpm <xref rid="pone.0076710-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The cells cannot respond to any change in the rotational direction at this speed. So this is considered to be the effect of simulated microgravity. The rotation around the vertical axis is considered to be the rotation control (dynamic control group). The cells cultured in the RWVS bioreactor without rotation are considered as the untreated control (static control group). In this study, the results of the rotation control and untreated control group showed no significant difference, and so, only the results of the simulated microgravity and untreated control are shown in this paper for simplification.</p>

The cells are gently vortexed and incubated for 15 minute at RT(25Â°C) in the dark. 400 Âµl of 1ÃBinding Buffer is added into each tube. The DNA content histograms are analyzed using a ModFit Cell Cycle Analysis Software V2.0 within 1 hour.

                <p>It can be seen from these results that the cell growth of osteosaroma is inhibited, and the inhibition effect increases with the extension of treatment time, which is consistent with previous research results. According to the basic theory of cell biology, the inhibition of cell growth is mainly due to the decrease in cell formation or increase in cell death.</p>
                <p>In order to see whether cellular reproduction level is affected by simulated microgravity, mitotic index (MI) is analyzed for this research. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, the MI changes follow the same tendency for both MG-63 and U-2 OS cell lines. After being treated for 24, 48 or 72 hours, there is no significant difference (chi-square test, <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) between untreated control and rotation control group. And after being treated for 24 hours, there is no significant difference between rotation control group and simulated microgravity group. While after being put under simulated microgravity for 48 hours, MI shows significant changes. And after being put under simulated microgravity for 72 hours, MI shows an extremely significant difference (chi-square test, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).

                <title>Cell Cycle Arrested and Cell Apoptosis Increased Under Simulated Microgravity</title>
                <p>In order to find out the reason why cell proliferation is inhibited, and verify the assumption based on MI, cell cycle and cell apoptosis are analyzed using FACSCalibur. The results of cell cycle analysis follow the same tendency in MG-63 and U-2 OS, which means, after being put under simulated microgravity for 24â96 hours, the number of cells in G1 phase decreases by more than 15%, and increases by more than 10% and 4% in S and G2/M phase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g003">Fig. 3AâB</xref>). These results are inconsistent with those of Zhang (2000) <xref rid="pone.0076710-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and Dai (2007) <xref rid="pone.0076710-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, so we repeated the experiments to prove the correctness of our results. It was found through further analysis that the cell lines used by Zhang and Daiâs are different from ours. So, we think the inconsistence is related to the cell lines used for the present study. The increase in number of cells in G2/M phase is consistent with MI, which is the right reason for MI increase. It can be seen from the results of MI and cell growth curves, that the cell cycles of MG-63 and U-2 OS are arrested in S and G2/M phases.</p>

For MG-63 and U-2 OS the cell number in G1 phase decreases and increases in S and G2/M phase under simulated microgravity. For hFOB1.19 cells, increase in S phase under simulated microgravity.

                <p>After being put under simulated microgravity, hFOB1.19 cells increases by more than 9% in S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

These results indicate that the cell cycle of hFOB1.19 is arrested in S phase, and after being put under simulated microgravity for 72 hours rat calvaria primary osteoblasts is arrested only in G2/M phases. This means simulated microgravity increase the cell numbers at different phases for different cells. For most of cells, arrest occurs in G2/M phase, which is consistent with the increase in MI that we observed. Experimental results indicate arrest can occur in other phase, for example, S phase, and cell cycle arrest lead to growth inhibition.</p>
                <p>Cell apoptosis is further analyzed for hFOB1.19 and rat calvaria primary osteoblast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g004">Fig. 4</xref>.

After being put under simulated microgravity for 24â72 hours, early apoptosis increases by less than 2% in rat calvaria primary osteoblast.

                <p>It is also observed through this study that cell proliferation inhibition is accompanied by cytoskeleton and spindle changes. We come to the conclusion which is similar to those of previous work that cytoskeleton changes under simulated microgravity. A spindle, which is the special formation of microtubules and the characteristic of mitosis, is observed under simulated microgravity during this study.

In order to find out the influence of simulated microgravity on the formation of a multipolar spindle, the ratio of multipolar spindles is calculated after the cells are cultured under simulated microgravity for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g006">Fig. 6</xref>, the incidence of multipolar spindles under simulated microgravity is higher than those for both untreated control and rotation control. Besides, the incidence of multipolar spindles increases with the extension of treatment time. Since there is no significant difference in the incidence of multipolar spindles between rotation control group and untreated control group, it can be concluded that the rotation around the vertical axis does not have any effect on the formation of a multipolar spindle.</p>

                <p>It can be seen from the presentation above that the incidence of multipolar spindles is different for different human osteosarcoma cell lines, and the incidence of U-2 OS is the lowest. According to ATCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atcc.org">http://www.atcc.org</ext-link>), the chromosome number of human osteoblast is not stable, but it is generally accepted by most of the researchers working in this field that hFOB1.19 is more stable than human osteosarcoma cell. However, as a matter of fact, multipolar spindles are observed in hFOB1.19 cells under normal culture conditions. In order to compare the responses of cell lines with different genome stability to simulated microgravity, primary osteoblasts are derived from Sprague-Dawley fetal rat calvaria. Although primary osteoblasts are more stable than other cell lines used for this study, multipolar spindles are also observed in the cells, which confirms that the availability of multipolar spindles is a common phenomenon in vitro. The incidence of multipolar spindles increases significantly after all the cell lines are put under simulated microgravity for this study.</p>
                <p>Normally, there is one centrosome in every spindle pole, but the spindle pole can be formed with the microtubules clustered without existing centrosome <xref rid="pone.0076710-Brinkley1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To further investigate the relationship between the formation of a multipolar spindle and the change in centrosome, U-2 OS, MG-63 and Saos-2 cells are analyzed with their centrosomes stained with anti-Centrin-2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). It is observed the centrosomes appear at each polar of a bipolar spindle and the multipolar spindle, supposing that a multipolar spindle appears simultaneously with multicentrosomes. There are centrosomes in all the polar regions indicate that simulated microgravity can change the number of spindle poles.</p>

                <p>Spindle is an important apparatus for mitosis, and its change in structure can have its influence on the process of cell division, and therefore the cell proliferation. So we think that the abnormal structure of a spindle is related to the cell proliferation inhibition.</p>

                <title>Expression of MAD2 and BUB1 Increased Under Simulated Microgravity</title>
                <p>SAC is a well-conserved mitosis control system, and it can be presented in kinetochore and monitors if the spindle structure and the chromosome display properly a bipolar attachment. If the attachment is not proper (monotely, syntely and merotely, etc.) <xref rid="pone.0076710-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, it triggers a cascade of reactions to inhibit the APC/C functioning by blocking the degradation of a target protein and the cleavage of a sister chromatid junction protein to stop the cell transition from metaphase to anaphase. This results in the arrest of cell cycle before the separation of a sister chromatid <xref rid="pone.0076710-Malmanche1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. BUB1and MAD2 are two major proteins in SAC pathway, and they are located at the beginning and end of the pathway, respectively.</p>
                <p>After the spindle pole changes under simulated microgravity, the expression of MAD2 and BUB1 are analyzed using western blot method in MG-63 and U-2 OS cells. It can be seen from the results that the expressions of MAD2 and BUB1 do not show a significant change in the rotation control group, but increase under simulated microgravity. After MG-63 cells were treated with simulated microgravity for 72 hours, the expressions of MAD2 and BUB1 increase to 3.9-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) and 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>) in comparison with the untreated control, respectively. The expression of SAC protein increases with the incidence of a multipolar spindle. This induces the cell cycle arrest and enables the repair of cells. The erroneous attachments should be corrected during the cell cycle arrest. Anaphase will not occur until all the chromosomes form proper bidirectional attachments to spindle microtubules <xref rid="pone.0076710-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>(Thompson et al., 2010). If the error cannot be corrected, the cells will be directed to apoptosis. If a SAC defect occurs, the cell will continue to divide, and it is very likely for a cell to undergo the malignant transformation and to lead to a high probability of genome instability <xref rid="pone.0076710-Ghadimi1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p>

                <p>On the basis of these findings, we assumed that simulated microgravity can induce a change in microtubule structure and a multicentrosome appears, and then lead to a change in spindle structure, SAC over expression, and cells blocked in the metaphase. The cells blocked in the metaphase have three fates, 1) divide after being repaired; 2) apoptosis because it cannot be repaired; 3) undergo abnormal division without being repaired. In 3.3 we have observed an increase in cell apoptosis, but we need further observation to confirm whether there is any other activity.</p>
                <p>It is found through this study that, the expression of SAC proteins (MAD2 and BUB1) increase together with the changes of spindle structure, so that the abnormal cells are blocked in metaphase. That is why we detected more multipolar spindles in metaphase under simulated microgravity, which causes the inhibition of cell proliferation.</p>

                <title>The Cells with a Multipolar Spindle can Divide and Cell Division Increase in the Cells Knocked Down for MAD2 or BUB1</title>
                <p>In order to confirm the fate of multipolar spindle cells, pmEGFP-alpha-tubulin is transfected into U-2 OS cells, and then, living cells are observed through Workstation (Zeiss cell observer system on âAxio Observer Z1â microscope) for more than 24 hours. The microtubules and spindles in green are clearly observed. And some cells with a multipolar spindle can divide. For example, the three-spindle cell shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g009">Fig. 9</xref> can divide into three parts in 10 minutes only. But most of the cells with multipolar spindle remain undivided for hours. It can be seen from these observsion that most of the cells with multipolar spindle are blocked in metaphase, and only a few of them can divide. Cell arrest is due to the abnormal spindle structure and the over-expression of MAD2 and BUB1. This is the reason why the incidence of multipolar spindle increases under simulated microgravity. The incidence of multipolar spindle is the result of dynamic changes between the formation and division of multipolar spindle cells. If more multipolar spindle cells are formed while less multipolar spindle cells divide, the multipolar spindle cells will accumulate in the culturing system. The number of cells will decrease as multipolar spindle cells divide.</p>

                <p>It can be seen from the results that multipolar cells divide after MAD2 and BUB1 knockdown, and lead to the entry of more cells into anaphase. DNA content is analyzed to see whether the cells can undergo multipolar division after MAD2/BUB1 knockdown. A normal division is completed when there is no change in the total DNA content, and the number of chromosomes remains unchanged in daughter cells. However the decrease in DNA content means one cell has divided into several cells.</p>
                <p>DNA content is analyzed using FACSCalibur for U-2 OS cells knocked down for MAD2 or BUB1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g011">Fig. 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0076710-t001">Table 1</xref>, G1 peak stays at FL2-A 200 nm in sinco. group under different culture conditions, and it is not time-varying.

It can be seen from the shift of G1 peak that the results indicated that the DNA content of diploid cells decreases, which confirms indirectly that multipolar division occurrs. Because the cell with a multipolar spindle divides into daughter cells, the decrease in DNA contents is due to the division of cells with multipolar spindle.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>In order to study the effect of microgravity on cell proliferation, mammalian osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts were kept under simulated microgravity in a rotating wall vessel (2D-RWVS) bioreactor, and then the changes in cell proliferation, spindle structure, expression of MAD2 or BUB1, and effect of MAD2 or BUB1 on the inhibition of cell proliferation are investigated.</p>
              <p>Experimental results indicate that the inhibition cell proliferation, incidence of multipolar spindles, multicentrosomes, and expression of MAD2 or BUB1 increases with the extension of treatment time. And multipolar cells enter mitosis after MAD2 or BUB1 is knocked down, which leads to the decrease in DNA content, and decrease the accumulation of cells within multipolar spindles. The process of cytoskeleton system âfeelsâ the changes in tension and finally influences the cell proliferation under simulated microgravity by following the pathway below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0076710-g013">Fig. 13</xref>). It can therefore be concluded that simulated microgravity can alter the structure of spindle microtubules, and stimulate the formation of multipolar spindles together with multicentrosomes, which causes the overexpression of SAC proteins to block the abnormal cells in metaphase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.</p>

              <p>By clarifying the relationship between cell proliferation inhibition, spindle structure and SAC changes under simulated microgravity, the molecular mechanism and morphology basis of proliferation inhibition induced by microgravity is revealed, which will give experiment and theoretical evidence for the mechanism of space bone loss and some other space medicine problems.</p>

                  <p>Verification of osteoblasts by their morphology, ALP staining, and formation of calcium nodules. A. Rat calvaria primary osteoblasts before staining. The dissociated cells are spindle-shaped while some cells are triangular or polygonal, with typical morphological characteristics of osteoblasts. The nodule in the middle is one calcium nodule formed by the osteoblasts after cultivation for 15 days. B. Rat calvaria primary osteoblasts after ALP (alkaline phosphatase) staining. ALP produced by osteoblasts can react with cobalt nitrate and ammonium sulfide to form gray and black particles. The dark cells are osteoblasts, while the white ones are fibroblasts. C. Rat calvaria primary osteoblasts after calcium nodule formation detecting. The osteoblasts can produce the calcium nodules after cultivation for 15 days. The main chemical compound of the nodules is calcium phosphate. It can react with silver nitrate under UV light and produce black silver grains. Neutral red were used after silver nitrate staining and the osteoblasts are in red color.</p>
