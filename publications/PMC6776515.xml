                <p id="Par1">NASA cleanrooms are certified by particle counts and are humidity-controlled, temperature-regulated, and oligotrophic in nature for assembling spacecraft subsystems. Microorganisms, which are not part of the cleanroom certification metrics, should not be overlooked when assessing the cleanliness of the facility since they can enter through soil or air, shed from humans, adapt to the oligotrophic conditions, and subsequently could contaminate spacecraft. These biogenic particles need to be identified to extend our knowledge of biological contamination for future NASA mission use. This study collected particles from the cleanroom and estimated the distribution of fallout microbial cell and inert dust particles using microscopy and molecular techniques. Aluminum coupon-based polycarbonate filter assemblies were deployed in the spacecraft assembly cleanroom facility to collect fallout particles. Epifluorescence and electron microscopy showed that particles varied in size and structure, and displayed live/dead biological and inert particle signatures from sources that include spores and fungal hyphae. Additionally, correlative epifluorescence and field emission scanning electron microscopy, combined with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (for elemental compositions) methods, differentiated whether microbes adhering to particles were live/dead cells or inert particles. This visualization approach allowed for the classification of microorganisms as being standalone (free-living) or associated with a particle, as well as its characteristic size. Furthermore, time-course microscopy was used to determine the microbial cell growth and confirm the biological/molecular identification. Routine investigation of cleanroom biological and inert fallout particles will help to determine the biological load of spacecraft components and will also have direct relevance to the pharmaceutical and medical industries. One of the main objectives for NASA’s current and future missions is to prevent forward and back contamination of exploring planets. The goal of this study is to determine the association of microorganisms with the inert, natural cleanroom fallout particles and to ascertain whether microorganisms prefer to adhere to a particle size. A novel microscopy technique was developed, and by utilizing various molecular techniques, particles and associated microbial phylogeny were characterized. An accurate assessment of the microbes associated with cleanroom particles is necessary to protect the health of the people who occupy the room for long duration for aeronautical, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.</p>

              <p id="Par2">Microorganism(s) associated with fallout particles are a critical concern for fabrication of sensitive products with highly liable surface particulate contamination, including medical devices, pharmaceutical products, electronic supplies, and spacecraft assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Fallout particles vary greatly in size (ranging from 0.1 μm to 1000 μm), morphology, and elemental composition, and can originate from sources such as human, cosmetics, cargo, and particles transported in the cleanroom environment from the external environment, which varies by geographic location<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the size distribution and chemical composition of natural fallout particles in critical indoor environments such as intensive care units (ICUs), spacecraft assembly facilities, and other industrial cleanrooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, reports on the biological burden associated with cleanroom natural fallout particles are not available. Even though National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) cleanrooms have been maintained with controlled airflow circulation, temperature, humidity, and rigorous cleaning, they are not sterile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p id="Par3">Since Viking, NASA has been assembling unmanned robotic spacecraft in cleanroom environments and continuously monitoring microorganisms to mitigate the forward contamination of other planets and bodies in the solar system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Since 2000, in addition to the NASA spore assay, advanced next-generation sequencing methods such as targeted gene(s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, as well as DNA microarray and shotgun metagenome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, were carried out to identify the microbial burden and their distribution on the cleanroom microbial ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, but no studies on the characterization of biological materials associated with fallout particles have been completed. In the past, particulate and microbial contamination were not assessed in tandem but analyzed separately using two distinct sets of witness coupons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, research needs to be conducted to estimate the distribution of microbial communities and their association with cleanroom particles from the same set of materials.</p>
              <p id="Par4">Large sets of science data were available on the indoor/outdoor airborne microbes from bulk materials that employed traditional culture-dependent and molecular approaches to identify the microbial diversity in environments specific to cleanrooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, visual characterization of particles were commonly captured using epifluorescence and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) since these approaches provide information on both morphology and organic elemental composition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, electron microscopy is limited to visualizing only the morphology of the target and cannot be used to discern biological particles from individual inert particles. In this communication, “inert particle” is defined as the particle that did not show any carbon signature when EDXA analysis was performed. Few studies utilized both microscopy and molecular biological techniques to concurrently link the microorganism to the environmental dust particles and determine whether microorganisms were associated with particles or were free-living<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recent advances in microscopy techniques such as correlative light and electron microscopy procedures have been utilized to image the same particles in the same sample with two different microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This integrated novel approach will help to understand whether the particles in question are biological or inert particle by characterizing morphology (microscopy), chemistry (EDXA), and biology (growth) of the contaminants. Particles were collected in multiple NASA cleanrooms, including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) assembly facility cleanrooms, using various microbiology and molecular biology techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This is the first time a study was systematically conducted to characterize microorganisms of NASA spacecraft cleanroom particles and its direct association with inert fallout particles.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Previously, we devised a witness coupon to collect fallout particles using polycarbonate (PC) filters and confirmed the presence of microbial cells using epifluorescence imaging and ImageJ analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. This study has applied the lessons learned from the prior study on an entirely new set of deployed coupons with the goal of characterizing microbial association with particles and its distribution profile in International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 5 and ISO 7 spacecraft assembly cleanroom environments. The main objective of this study is to develop a correlative epifluorescence microscopy (EFM) based technique combined with FESEM-EDXA (cEFM-FESEM-EDXA) to acquire information on the same field of image on the viability (live/dead) of microbial cell, morphology of the structure, and elemental composition of the fallout particle. Furthermore, microorganisms associated with particles were isolated and identified.</p>

                <p id="Par6">The JPL spacecraft assembly facility examined in this study is maintained with cleaning regimens at frequencies appropriate to the current level of activity of the cleanroom facility. At the time of the sampling events, a significant amount of assembly activity of critical spacecraft hardware occupied the clean room. Thus, cleaning frequency for facility at the time of sampling was daily. Daily cleaning regimens of cleanroom facility maintenance include the replacing of tacky mats, wiping surfaces, and vacuuming/mopping floors using clean room-certified sanitizing agents (disinfectants, alcohol, or ultrapure water). All personnel who enter the cleanrooms must take appropriate actions to minimize the influx of particulate matter. Specific entry procedures varied depending on the certification level of the clean room and the presence or absence of mission hardware. General precautions include donning of cleanroom-certified garments to minimize exposure of skin, hair, and the regular clothing of the personnel. General precautions also include prohibition of the usage of cosmetics, fragrances, body spray, and hair gels before entry into the cleanroom. The air of both facilities was filtered through high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters. The total number of particles of the size &gt;0.5 µm were &lt;10,000/ft<sup>3</sup> of air during the period of this study even though this facility certification is ISO-7.</p>

These witness coupons were deployed to trap fallout particles and replaced every two weeks for four consecutive sampling periods in the JPL spacecraft assembly facility cleanrooms (ISO 5 and ISO 7; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Coupons were removed and carefully transferred to the lab, and the PC filters aseptically disassembled from the coupons and processed. Next, the PC filters and the trapped particles were mounted on to the borosilicate glass Buchner filter funnel device (Millipore, USA), washed with sterile water, and stained with BacLight stain mixture. The stain mixture contained equal volumes of propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO 9 solution provided in the BacLight viability kit (catalog no. L7012; Molecular probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). This step was followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, and then the PC filters were washed four times with particle-free water.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Biological fallout coupon deployed location at JPL clean room test bed.

Once a culture was confirmed to be pure, the UltraClean DNA kit (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA) was used to extract the DNA. Next, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene to identify bacterial strains using the forward primer, 27 F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and the reverse primer, 1492 R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 mins, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 sec, annealing at 55 °C for 50 sec, extension at 72 °C for 90 sec, and finalized by extension at 72 °C for 10 mins. The sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from the DNAStar Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The bacterial sequences were searched against EzTaxon-e database. The identification was based on the closest percentage similarity (&gt;97%) to previously identified microbial type strains. The 16S rRNA sequences of the isolates were deposited in the NCBI GenBank under accession no.: MN006145 – MN006154.</p>

First, the following command was used to open an image for a particle analysis using ImageJ: Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Threshold &gt; Max Entropy &gt; Apply. Next, the split channels option was used to split the red and green fluorescence particles: Image &gt; Color &gt; Split Channels; and for color threshold: Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Threshold. Finally, the particles were counted using the commands: Analyze &gt; Analyze Particles, with the upper and lower limits of the particle size set at 0 to infinity, selected to “show outlines” and checked the box to “Summarize.” Each counted particle was outlined and numbered with the diameter of the particle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
                <p id="Par13">The ratio of microorganisms to particles was determined using a multi-step process. First, the sizes of each detected particle were determined as described above. These particles were binned as inert (red fluorescence) or viable/intact particles (green fluorescence). Second, images of the fallout particles were captured using FESEM to determine the associated particle size, and its chemical composition was confirmed using EDXA. The shortfall of the EFM method alone is that it does not give ample resolution to determine whether the green fluorescence comes from one or more closely packed particles. The use of FESEM eliminated this deficiency and allowed the study to determine the fraction of particles that are multiples for each particle size. The FESEM observations further informed the bin size selection as displayed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. The ratio of microorganisms to particles was enumerated using the combination of inert/viable particles by size per the EFM and the fraction of singlet/multiple particle combinations as gathered by FESEM.</p>

In this technique, particles collected on PC filters were stained with BacLight, tracked by EFM, and the generated image was processed using ImageJ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Ba,b</xref>). Subsequently, the PC filters were carbon coated, and the corresponding regions were acquired using FESEM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Bc</xref>). This analysis revealed a substantial correlation between the particles observed by EFM and FESEM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Bb,c1–c4</xref>). The observed images suggested that the filter was not contaminated and that the particles were not moved during the sample processing and transport. In addition, the detailed chemical compositions of individual particles analyzed showed that they were carbon and oxygen rich, suggesting that all the particles were biogenic in nature, such as fungal hyphae or bacterial spores (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5Bc2–c4</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Visualization of fallout particles using cEFM-SEM-EDXA.

Spores of a cleanroom isolate, <italic>Bacillus pumillus</italic> SAFR032, were spotted onto the PC filter, and the spore germination was tracked using BacLight staining. The spores on top of the PC filters were revived when placed onto a TSA agar plate and germinated normally (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). The spore ripening period required 60 min of incubation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6Ba–c</xref>). After 90 mins of incubation, the elongated cell formation was observed, and fully formed vegetative cells could be observed after 180 mins of incubation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6Bd–f</xref>). Two PC filters from each location that collected cleanroom particles were subjected to microscopy and culture techniques.

The combined analyses of EFM and FESEM/EDXA enabled the study to group the particle size and determine the association of microbial cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Both microbial cells (C signature in EDXA) and inert particles were accounted in this analysis. In both facilities, the majority of the larger particles (20–50 µm) had microorganisms. Furthermore, only ~5.2% of the smaller particles (0–1.9 µm) were free-floating and exhibited green fluorescence (EFM; BacLight staining), confirming that they were microbial cells. A third set of particles binned into the larger category consisted of the size range &gt;50 µm. From this analysis, three distinct models were extrapolated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). They are: Fallout Model 3 – this model reflects the actual as-measured data. There were no biological particles observed over 50 microns using both the FEM and FESEM methods, as represented by the dotted line. This implies that microorganisms do not associate with particles larger than 50 μm in a cleanroom environment. On the other hand, if we were to find one biological particle greater than 50 µm, and maintained the resulting slope, the extrapolated line is captured by Fallout Model 2. If, however, the slope was maintained at a constant value, the resulting extrapolated model is captured in Fallout Model 1. The purpose for the three extrapolated fallout models is to inform the bounds of the overall spacecraft-level particle and biological transport model. These conservative and nominal estimates allow us to understand the sensitivities of the estimates in order to effectively quantify the cleanliness of the acquired samples of unknown origin.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Total viable organisms per particles distribution in a cleanroom facility with three extrapolation methods: (<bold>A</bold>) An example graph of an ImageJ particle count outputs plotted on the of x and y coordinates and over-layered according to its size.

The goal of this study is to determine the association of microorganisms with the inert, natural cleanroom fallout particles and to ascertain whether microorganisms prefer to adhere to a particular particle size. A novel microscopy technique was developed, and by utilizing various molecular techniques, particles and associated microbial phylogeny were characterized. By providing an accurate and confident assessment of the microbes associated with cleanroom particles, it is possible to protect the health of the people who occupy the room for long duration in assembling critical components. The outcome from this study would help to address the distribution of microbes to particles on the spacecraft and the associated environment, as well as help other pharmaceutical and medical industries. Multiple studies have used SYTO9 and PI for the estimation of live and dead biological particles and electron microscopy to characterize morphology and elemental composition; however, no report is available where all of these techniques were used together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

The particles characterized in this study utilizing microscopy techniques ranged from 0.5–500 μm in diameter and displayed morphologies that varied from carbonaceous tubular structures to regular- and irregular-shaped biological and inert particles. Additionally, EDX analyses of the large inert particles (10–500 μm in diameter) showed that Al and Si groups were dominated and that the shapes of particles varied from triangular to irregular. Notably, fiber-like individual carbonaceous inert particles were dominated by tubular structures ranging from 50–200 μm in diameter. Interestingly, biological particles were associated with sizes ranging from 1–50 μm. A spherical or tubular-shape biological particle, such as bacteria, fungal spore, and hyphae, were also observed with C and O signatures as well as minor amounts of other essential elements (Na, Mg, K, Ca, and Cl).

The live biological fallout particles as observed via microscopy were cultured on the specific media needed to perform downstream DNA sequencing for the species level identity. These particle-associated biological materials were archived for further analyses, which would enable us to understand their resistance characteristics toward various cleaning and sterilization techniques.</p>
              <p id="Par26">In conclusion, correlative epifluorescence and electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (cEFM-SEM-EDX) and ImageJ processing are useful for the evaluation of fallout particles and their corresponding size distribution. The proposed method is precise and rapid. Furthermore, the recommended method could be very useful for investigating the behavior of the particles themselves, according to their morphology and size, on the spacecraft assembly cleanroom facilities.</p>
