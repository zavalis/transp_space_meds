              <abstract>
                <p>Evidence indicates that astronauts experience significant bone loss in space. We previously showed that simulated microgravity (μXg) using the NASA developed rotary cell culture system (RCCS) enhanced bone resorbing osteoclast (OCL) differentiation. However, the mechanism by which μXg increases OCL formation is unclear. RANK/RANKL signaling pathway is critical for OCL differentiation. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been shown to increase osteoclastogenesis. We hypothesize that TRAIL may play an important role in μXg enhanced OCL differentiation. In this study, we identified by RT profiler PCR array screening that μXg induces high levels of TRAIL expression in murine preosteoclast cells in the absence of RANKL stimulation compared to ground based (Xg) cultures. We further identified that μXg elevated the adaptor protein TRAF-6 and fusion genes OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression in preosteoclast cells. Interestingly, neutralizing antibody against TRAIL significantly reduced μXg induced OCL formation. We further identified that over-expression of pTRAIL in RAW 264.7 cells enhanced OCL differentiation. These results indicate that TRAIL signaling plays an important role in the μXg increased OCL differentiation. Therefore, inhibition of TRAIL expression could be an effective countermeasure for μXg induced bone loss.</p>

            <p>Weightlessness under microgravity (μXg) condition causes reduction in bone mineral density (BMD)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> which remains a major challenge for astronauts during long-term space mission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Astronauts experience a total bone loss around 0–3% whereas bone loss in weight bearing bones such as spine and hip is about 0–20% depending upon their space flight exercise program, nutritional status and drug therapy under microgravity (μXg) conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. During spaceflight, lumbar spine, pelvis and proximal femur of the skeleton losses bone mineral density about 2–3% per month with an increase in urine excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In addition, all the astronauts from long-term spaceflights have been recorded with T- or Z-scores less than −2.0 even after 10–15% BMD loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Also, fifteen days of space-flown (STS-131 space shuttle mission) mice have demonstrated 2 to 24% bone loss per month<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The morphological changes observed in astronaut’s bones after space flight also resembles osteoporotic patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Nutritional supplementation and exercise have been astronauts’ daily tasks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>; however, bone loss remains a major challenge in space. Therefore, bone loss is a serious concern for long-term inhabitants of the space station and for space exploration. Recently, it has been reported that the combination of the advanced resistive exercise device (ARED) and bisphosphonates improved the weight bearing bone mineral density<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Although, mechano-stimulation influence bone strength and structure, the changes are irreversible with a poor recovery rate under microgravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p>
            <p>Osteoclast (OCL) is hematopoietic origin and differentiated into multinucleated cell which resorb bone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The TNF family member receptor activator for nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) is critical for OCL precursor differentiation to form multinucleated OCL. RANKL interaction with RANK receptor activates various signaling cascades during OCL differentiation/activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Further, simulated μXg using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed rotary cell culture system (RCCS) and hind-limb suspension of unloading in a murine model indicated the impact of μXg on bone cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Previously, it has been shown that osteopenia in the immobilized rat hind-limb model is associated with increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Similarly, isolated fetal mouse long bones under near weightlessness conditions demonstrated decreased mineralization and increased calcium release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Also, bone forming activity of osteoblast cells is decreased under μXg conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Microgravity results in the uncoupling of bone remodeling between formation and resorption which could account for bone loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In addition, intact limb bones of the newts on board of a biosatellite Cosmos-2229 demonstrated elevated calcium content and histologic analysis revealed OCL activation on endosteal surface of long bones on 20<sup>th</sup> day<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Studies during the FOTON-3 mission identified μXg directly target genes associated with OCL formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Several studies have been identified that μXg increases OCL bone resorptive activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Enhanced OCL differentiation under μXg has been shown with increase in collagen telopeptide levels in media samples retrieved from space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Simulated μXg directly affects cell survival and differentiation of human preosteoclasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition, μXg aggravates RANKL-induced reactive oxygen species and increased OCL differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Evidence also suggests that NF-κB1 is involved with a rapid reduction of bone mass in space<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Also, it has been shown that OCLs were activated when the medaka fish were reared for 56 days at the international space station and the whole transcriptome analysis indicated fkbp5 and ddit4 genes were strongly up-regulated in the flight group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Recently, we used the RCCS to simulate μXg and showed increased osteoclastogenesis. Also, microarray analysis of gene expression profiling in modeled μXg revealed significant increase in expression of critical molecules such as cytokines/growth factors, proteases and signaling proteins, which may play an important role in enhanced OCL differentiation/function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In addition, gravity regulates RANKL and OPG expression in bone marrow stromal cells in the bone microenvironment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, the mechanisms of μXg induced bone loss and rational approaches to improve bone strength under weightlessness conditions are yet to be established.</p>
            <p>Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TNSF10/Apo2L/TRAIL) is a member of the TNF superfamily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> expressed either as a type II transmembrane protein or as a soluble protein detectable in different biological fluids under physiological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in malignant cells and at low doses promotes proliferation of normal mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. In murine cells, TRAIL functions through DR5 which contain a death domain motif and also binds to DcR1, DcR2S (secreted form) and DcR2L (transmembrane form) receptors which lack of a death domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Also, TRAIL binds weakly with osteoprotegerin (OPG)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. It has been demonstrated that TRAIL induces OCL differentiation in pathological conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Further, TRAIL activates TRAF6 dependent signaling pathway to increase OCL formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. However, the role of TRAIL in microgravity included OCL formation is unknown.</p>
            <p>In this study, we used the NASA developed ground-based RCCS to simulate μXg conditions and demonstrated high levels of TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells in the absence of RANKL stimulation. We further identified that inhibition of TRAIL by a neutralizing antibody suppressed μXg induced OCL formation.</p>

                <title>Microgravity modulation of TRAIL/receptors expression in preosteoclast cells</title>
                <p>Although, we previously demonstrated that simulated μXg by RCCS enhances OCL formation in mouse bone marrow cultures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, the molecular mechanisms involved are unclear. To further identify the μXg modulation of factors that enhances osteoclastogenesis, we subjected a homogeneous population of OCL progenitors RAW 264.7 cells to μXg in RCCS for optimal time point 24 h and total RNA isolated from these cells was utilized to screen RT Profiler array for 84 cytokine/growth factors by quantitative PCR analysis. The web portal analysis of array screening data for differential gene expression is shown as scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Various gene expression changes observed under μXg conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>. We thus identified μXg upregulation of TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis further confirmed μXg elevated (14.5-fold) TRAIL mRNA expression in mouse bone marrow derived preosteoclast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). In addition, we performed confocal microscopy analysis for TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells under μXg conditions. We identified that μXg strongly enhanced TRAIL expression in RAW 264.7 cells compared to ground based control (Xg) cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). These results suggest that μXg directly stimulates TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells. Microgravity regulation of TRAIL receptor expression in murine preosteoclast cells is unknown. Therefore, we further examined the μXg modulation of TRAIL receptor expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells subjected to μXg for 24 h and total RNA isolated was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for TRAIL receptor mRNA expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, μXg increased DR5 (3-fold) mRNA expression, whereas DcR1 and DcR2S expression levels were decreased when compared to cells cultured under normal Xg. However, no change was observed in DcR2L expression in these cells. These results indicate that μXg differentially regulates TRAIL receptors expression and that DR5 receptors expression is significantly upregulated in preosteoclast cells.</p>

                <title>Microgravity stimulates TRAF6 adaptor protein and fusion gene expression in preosteoclast cells</title>
                <p>Both RANKL and TRAIL has been shown to signals through TRAF6 adaptor protein in preosteoclast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Therefore, we examined the μXg regulation of TRAF6 expression in mouse bone marrow derived preosteoclast cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, the TRAF6 mRNA expression was significantly increased (6-fold) in μXg subjected mouse bone marrow derived non-adherent cells compared to ground based control cells. Further, western blot analysis of total cell lysates obtained from these cells demonstrated a significant increase (4.5-fold) in the levels of TRAF6 protein expression in the absence of RANKL stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>). Dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) and osteoclast-stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) have been identified as essential factors for preosteoclast fusion to form multinucleated giant cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Therefore, we further examined the μXg effect of OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression in preosteoclast cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that μXg elevated OC-STAMP mRNA expression (5.5-fold), whereas DC-STAMP moderately increased (2.2-fold) in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To test whether TRAIL regulate OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression, we treated the preosteoclast cells with different concentration of TRAIL (0–200 ng/ml) for 24 h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>, real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that TRAIL treatment at 100 ng/ml concentration significantly increased OC-STAMP (12-fold) and DC-STAMP (2.5-fold) expression. These results suggest that μXg modulation of TRAF6 adaptor protein and fusion gene mRNA expression may play an important role in TRAIL induced OCL differentiation under μXg conditions.</p>

                <title>Microgravity but not RANKL induces TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells</title>
                <p>We further examined μXg modulation of TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells at variable time points. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates obtained from mouse bone marrow derived non-adherent cells cultured under μXg condition for different time points (0–48 h) revealed 8-fold and 6-fold increase in the level of TRAIL protein expression at 24 and 48 h, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Since RANKL is critical for OCL differentiation in the bone microenvironment, we next examined the RANKL regulation of TRAIL expression. RANKL treatment at variable doses (0–50 ng/ml) for 24 h had a dose-dependent decrease in TRAIL expression in mouse bone marrow derived preosteoclast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These results indicate that μXg but not RANKL induce TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells to enhance OCL differentiation.</p>

                <p>We next examined whether μXg induced TRAIL expression involved in enhanced OCL differentiation. Mouse bone marrow derived non-adherent cells were subjected to μXg for 24 h and treated with RANKL and M-CSF for 7 days in the presence and absence of anti-TRAIL antibody (5 μg/ml). Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive multinucleated cells (MNC) formed in these cultures were scored. Interestingly, cells treated with a neutralizing antibody against TRAIL inhibit μXg induced OCL differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). To further confirm the role of TRAIL in OCL formation, RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (EV) or TRAIL expression vectors (pTRAIL) as described in Methods for 2 days. Western blot analysis of total cell lysates obtained from these cells showed a 7-fold increase in the levels of TRAIL expression compared to EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7a</xref>). Furthermore, TRAIL over-expression in preosteoclast cells showed a significant increase in TRAP positive MNC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b,c</xref>). These results indicate that increased levels of TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells enhance OCL differentiation under μXg conditions.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>Microgravity (μXg) in space could alter normal bone homeostasis. Osteoclast (OCL) being the primary bone resorbing cell, it is important to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the μXg control of OCL formation. Previously, we and others have reported that microgravity induce transcription factors which regulate gene expression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. This study identifies the increased levels of TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells subjected to simulated μXg conditions in the absence of RANKL stimulation suggest a direct effect of microgravity on TRAIL expression at gene transcription level. TRAIL isoforms (α, β and γ) have been identified and implicated in cellular growth/differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. However, in this study we show microgravity upregulation of TRAIL isoform (34 kDa) predominantly in preosteoclast cells and that RANKL downregulates TRAIL expression. TRAIL has been reported to induces apoptosis in malignant cells and promote proliferation of normal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that enhanced levels of OCL formation under μXg conditions could be due to increased numbers of preosteoclast cells. TRAIL is expressed either as a type II transmembrane or soluble protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and has been localized in both cytoplasm and membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Our confocal microscopy analysis revealed μXg enhanced TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells and consistent with cellular localization as reported. Further, this study demonstrated that μXg increases DR5 and decrease DcR1, DcR2s TRAIL receptor expression suggests that DR5 could play an important role in TRAIL signaling in preosteoclast cells. It has been reported that binding of TRAIL to DR5 has no physiologic relevance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. However, μXg modulation of DR5 expression suggests that TRAIL signaling through DR5 receptors may have pathologic significance under low gravity conditions. Our results favor previous findings that TRAIL induces osteoclast differentiation via direct engagement with the TRAIL death receptor through a signaling pathway distinct from apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Since the expression of other TRAIL receptors such as DcR1 and DcR2L is also detected in preosteoclast cells, we cannot rule out the participation of these receptors in osteoclast differentiation. This study identifies that μXg also enhanced the levels of TRAF6 expression in preosteoclast cells without RANKL stimulation. TRAF6 is an adaptor protein critical for RANKL-RANK receptor signaling essential for OCL differentiation. Recent evidence also indicates that TRAF6 mediates TRAIL signaling to increase OCL differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that μXg induction of TRAIL may signals through TRAF6 dependent pathway to promote OCL formation under low gravity. We recently demonstrated that μXg induction of autophagy modulates OCL formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. It has been shown that TRAIL induces cytoprotective autophagy in un-transformed cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. Therefore, TRAIL signaling may promote autophagy process for survival of OCL progenitor cells under stress in low gravity conditions.</p>
              <p>It has been demonstrated that inhibition of PI 3-kinase signaling results in induction of TRAIL expression play a role in intestinal cell homeostasis. Also, NFATc1 activation through suppression of Sp1 transcription factor increased TRAIL expression in human intestinal cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. We have recently demonstrated that RANKL induction by TRAIL via STAT-6 dependent pathway in bone marrow stroma/preosteoblast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. TRAIL receptor signaling has been implicated in cytokine production and NF-kB activation in macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>. Therefore, understanding the μXg regulation of signaling pathways and downstream effectors that would modulate TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells would provide important insights to develop countermeasures for bone loss under microgravity.</p>
              <p>As evident from the results using the neutralizing antibody against TRAIL, we showed that TRAIL participates in μXg enhanced OCL differentiation. Further, over-expression of TRAIL in preosteoclast cells enhanced OCL differentiation in the presence of RANKL. This study also demonstrated that μXg elevated the fusion gene expression such as OC-STAMP and DC-STAMP expression essential for OCL formation. In fact, our results indicated that OC-STAMP expression is highly pronounced compared to DC-STAMP in preosteoclast cells under μXg conditions. Furthermore, TRAIL modulates fusion gene expression suggest a potential role for TRAIL in μXg induced OCL formation. In contrast, we observe μXg had no significant effect (data not shown) on other molecules such as Pim-1, an intracellular signaling molecule suggested to plays a role in OCL formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Therefore, it is likely that μXg increased TRAIL expression in preosteoclast cells promotes osteoclastogenesis and could be a potential therapeutic target to control bone loss in space.</p>
