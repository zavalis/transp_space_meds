                <p>Understanding the effects of spaceflight on plant flowering regulation is important to setup a life support system for long-term human space exploration. However, the way in which plant flowering is affected by spaceflight remains unclear. Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the Chinese spacelab Tiangong-2, in which Arabidopsis wild-type and transgenic plants <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> germinated and grew as normally as their controls on the ground, but the floral initiation under the long-day condition in space was about 20 days later than their controls on the ground. Time-course series of digital images of <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> plants showed that the expression rhythm of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> in space did not change, but the peak appeared later in comparison with those of their controls on the ground. Whole-genome microarray analysis revealed that approximately 16% of Arabidopsis genes at the flowering stage changed their transcript levels under spaceflight conditions in comparison with their controls on the ground. The GO terms were enriched in DEGs with up-regulation of the response to temperature, wounding, and protein stabilization and down-regulation of the function in circadian rhythm, gibberellins, and mRNA processes. <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SOC1</italic> could act as hubs to integrate spaceflight stress signals into the photoperiodic flowering pathway in Arabidopsis in space.</p>

              <title>1. Introduction</title>
              <p>Long-duration manned space exploration will require close biological life support systems (BLSS) in which humans can live while reducing the minimum amount of water, oxygen, and nutrients to be transported and optimizing the recycling of reusable waste [<xref rid="B1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such a system will require an edible plant to be successfully cultivated long term in the environmental conditions expected to be achieved during spaceflight and on arrival at nearby objects [<xref rid="B3-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Spaceflight conditions, including microgravity or low gravity, radiation, temperature, air and soil composition constraints, etc., greatly affect plant survival and adaption. Moreover, the volume and energy supply in the isolation chambers in space used to cultivate plants are very limited. Thus, to construct some higher resource-use efficiency with high yield plants is necessary for plant-based BLSS.</p>
              <p>Flowering time is an important trait in breeding for crop yield and is very sensitive to environment stresses, such as drought, cold, salt, and nutrients [<xref rid="B4-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a compensatory mechanism, flowering time as well as seed production are often changed in stressful environments [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In space, the completion of the seed-to-seed cycle is further constrained due to the presence of factors such as microgravity, which could trigger multiple stressors to affect absorption, transport, and the distribution of water and nutrients in plants, as well as transpiration rates [<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The attempts of several pioneering space experiments to grow plants through a complete life cycle were unsuccessful because plants frequently delayed development or died in the transition from the vegetative to reproductive stages [<xref rid="B10-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The first plant that produced new seeds in space was Arabidopsis [<xref rid="B14-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With the improvement in cultivation chambers, serial space experiments successfully completed a full life cycle with several plants, including Arabidopsis, <italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic>, pea, and wheat [<xref rid="B15-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, plants often developed reduced numbers of flowers, changed inflorescence structures, and developed smaller and more lightweight seeds, with storage reserves changed in comparison with ground control plants in these space experiments [<xref rid="B20-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is a risk for the achievement of resource-use efficiency in plant-based BLSS. The increase in plant reproduction in space has begun to attract more attention because of the opportunity to conduct long-term experiments in space provided by space stations and the increasing demand for higher efficiency BLSS for long-duration spaceflights.</p>
              <p>One of the most important processes for plant reproductive development is flowering time, which is regulated by day length (photoperiod pathway), prolonged periods of cold (vernalization pathway), the autonomous pathway, and the gibberellic acid pathway [<xref rid="B21-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These different pathways converge to regulate the expression of the floral integration genes <italic toggle="yes">SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">SOC1</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">FT</italic>) that act in concert to initiate flowering. Photoperiod and temperature information in Arabidopsis is processed through a circadian clock-dependent mechanism to induce the expression of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic>, in long-day (LD) [<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The induction of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> occurs in leaves, in which the FT protein is transferred to the shoot apical meristem to promote flower formation together with SOC1, which is locally produced in response to FT accumulation [<xref rid="B23-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This mechanism of photoperiod-controlled flowering originally characterized in Arabidopsis is highly conserved in angiosperms (including major crops, such as rice, wheat, barley, and potato). In addition, Arabidopsis has played a very important role in understanding plant adaption to spaceflight, especially plant growth and tropisms [<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
              <p>Our previous experiments studied the flowering of Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis plants in space on board the Chinese recoverable satellites SJ-8 and SJ-10. In these two flight experiments, plants had fully developed rosettes at the time of launch and initiated flowering shoots while in orbit [<xref rid="B26-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The aim of the present work was to examine how photoperiod conditions affect the flowering time of plants grown under microgravity in space on board the Chinese spacelab TG-2 from seeds to seeds. The photoperiod response depends on the induction of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> [<xref rid="B22-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To understand the role of how <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> is induced in response to the photoperiod response in space, we generated a <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> transgenic plant (<italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic>) construction to study the regulation of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> assessed by GFP fluorescence. The WT and <italic toggle="yes">ft-10</italic> mutant plants were used as controls. In addition, the altered expression of genes in the flowering signaling pathway of plants grown under spaceflight conditions is also analyzed.</p>

                <p>Arabidopsis wild-type (WT), <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> transgenic plants (<italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic>), and <italic toggle="yes">ft-10</italic> mutant plants were grown in culture chambers (CCs), which were installed in plant culture boxes (PCBs) under microgravity (µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) on board the Chinese spacelab TG-2 (µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB) and under normal gravity (1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) on the ground either in PCB (1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB) or in a greenhouse (GH) (1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-GH), as described above (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
                <p>Downloaded images revealed that seeds of WT, <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> transgenic plants and the <italic toggle="yes">ft-10</italic> mutant in CCs under both the LD and SD conditions in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB started to germinate from 3 days after being sown (DAS). Seeds in space germinated well irrespective of photoperiodic conditions (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). After germination, WT, <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ft-10</italic> plants developed rosette leaves in either LD or SD in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB. On 10 DAS, expanded rosette leaves spread upward away from the plate under LD in CCs in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB and on the ground either in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB or 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-GH (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A,H,O), while those with elongated hypocotyls and smaller cotyledon under SD were observed in the three growth conditions (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A,H,O and <xref rid="app1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="app">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
                <p>WT and <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> transgenic plants grown under LD in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB flowered later than those under the same photoperiodic condition on the ground in either 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB or 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-GH (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>E,J,Q and <xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The first bolting (start of peduncle growth) took place on 42 DAS (median 48 DAS for WT; 47 DAS for <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic>) in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB, and on 25 DAS (median 27 DAS) for WT and 27 DAS (median 32 DAS) for <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> on the ground in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB, on 31 DAS (median 37 DAS) for WT and 34 DAS (median 37 DAS) for <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-GH (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A,B). In addition, the spaceflight plants (both WT and <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic>) also had approximately two more rosette leaves at flowering than their control plants on the ground (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C,D). However, statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference for WT among the three growth conditions and for <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> transgenic plants between µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB and 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-GH conditions, except for a significant difference between µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB and 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB conditions (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C,D).</p>
                <p>The plants grown under SD in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB did not flower until 70 DAS, nor as well as those on the ground (both 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB and 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-GH) did (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="app1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="app">Figure S2</xref>). To further determine the influence of microgravity on daylength-regulation flowering, we transferred these plants, both in spaceflight and on the ground, from SD to the LD condition. The results showed that WT and <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> plants in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB started bolting at day 43 (at 113 DAS) after being transferred from SD to LD (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>V), while those in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB began bolting at day 15 (75 DAS) after being transferred to LD (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>X). Finally, plants reached the stages of seed maturity with complete senescence on day 324 in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB in space (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>W) and on day 41 in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB on the ground (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>Y) after being transferred from the SD to the LD.</p>

In the leaves of plants grown under LD in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB on the ground, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> rapidly increased from 10 DAS and reached peak levels at approximately 22 DAS (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C,D). In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> expression in the leaves of plants under the same condition in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB in space remained at a low level during the first 15 DAS, and reached a higher level at about 43 DAS, then continued to rise to peak levels at 50–55 DAS (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>B,D). The peak level of <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> expression in the µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB plants was apparently higher than their control on the ground (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>D).</p>
                <p>The induction of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> expression with a diurnal rhythm was considered the most effective to promote Arabidopsis flowering under LD conditions [<xref rid="B27-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To examine whether this dynamic of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> expression also encodes LD information in spaceflight plants, we compared the level of <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP</italic> expression in leaves of plants in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB in space at Zeigeber time 0.5 h (ZT: time after light on set) and ZT16 h, respectively, with that in plants in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB on the ground (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The expression level of <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> in both spaceflight plants and the ground controls increased more at ZT 16 than that at ZT 0.5, but the amplitude of the enhanced daily level in spaceflight plants was smaller than that in the ground controls (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C). These results indicate that the diurnal rhythm pattern of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> expression under LD in space remained the same as their ground controls, but the expression level increased in smaller amplifications.</p>

                <title>2.3. Altered Expression of Genes in Arabidopsis Leaves at Flowering Stage in Space</title>
                <p>To explore the influence of spaceflight on a whole transcription scale, we performed microarray analysis using the leaves of WT plants grown under LD on board TG-2 in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB and on the ground in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB. The samples were harvested at ZT16 when the expression of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> was at the peak and fixed with RNA later. RNA was extracted and the altered expression of the genes in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB plants was identified by comparing it with the expression level of the genes in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB plants on the ground when controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at the level of 0.05 using the method of Storey and Tibshirani (2003) [<xref rid="B28-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Of the genes that met these criteria, we rank-ordered them by fold change (FC). The genes in which the expression level was changed more than 2 (FC ≥ 2) were selected as differential expression genes (DEG). <xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A showed that 3462 genes of µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB samples exhibited differential expression in comparison with those in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB plants on the ground (<xref rid="app1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the samples demonstrated a strong difference between the transcriptomes of samples grown in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB in space and in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB on the ground (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>B). Compared with those on the ground in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB, 1793 genes were up-regulated, while there were 1669 down-regulated genes in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB samples (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref rid="app1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="app">Table S1</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis showed that up-regulated genes are involved in the metabolic process, and the response to stress was enriched (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C, <xref rid="app1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="app">Table S2a</xref>), while down-regulated genes function in response to stimulus, the reproductive developmental process, and the regulation of the metabolic process (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>C, <xref rid="app1-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="app">Table S2b</xref>). To validate the microarray data, we generated sequence-specific primers and performed real-time qRT-PCR on a third independent replicate. Real-time PCR with isoform-specific primers for plant invertase (<italic toggle="yes">INV</italic>, AT3G17130), ethylene response DNA binding factor 3 (<italic toggle="yes">EDF3</italic>, AT3G25730), annexin 2 (<italic toggle="yes">ANNAT2</italic>, AT5G65020), annexin 3 (<italic toggle="yes">ANNAT3</italic>, AT2G38760), jasmonate-zim-domain protein 10 (<italic toggle="yes">JAZ10</italic>, AT5G13220), xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 19 (<italic toggle="yes">XTH19</italic>, AT4G30290), ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2 (<italic toggle="yes">EIN2</italic>, AT5G03280), F-box/RNI-like superfamily protein (<italic toggle="yes">TIR1</italic>, AT3G62980), auxin efflux carrier family protein (<italic toggle="yes">PIN4</italic>, AT2G01420), and auxin transporter-like protein 1 (<italic toggle="yes">LAX1</italic>, AT5G01240) confirmed the relative abundance changes for the transcript levels of these genes in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB samples in comparison with those in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB samples (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f008" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
                <p>Based on FLOR-ID [<xref rid="B29-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], 53 flowering genes were identified among the DEGs (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). We classified this set of 53 transcripts according to their known or predicted function in the flowering regulation pathway. Most of these flowering genes regulated by spaceflight were functionally categorized to be involved in photoperiodism and light perception and signaling (28% of total DEGs in the flowering pathway), 15 of these DEGs function in photoperiodism, 2 genes were up-regulated, while 13 genes showed a decrease in transcript abundance. In the following, DEGs function in general (23%), circadian clock (15%), gibberellins (8%), ambient temperature (8%), aging (8%), vernalization (4%), and sugar (4%) were also observed (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). The data showed that an overall down-regulation of the light response, gibberellins, circadian clock, and ambient temperature occurred. At the same time, a few genes involved in photoperiodism, the circadian clock, sugar, gibberellins, and aging up-regulated expression levels in response to spaceflight were also observed (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>A,B). In addition, two flowering time integrator genes, <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SOC1</italic>, which changed expression levels in µ× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB in comparison with the controls in 1× <italic toggle="yes">g</italic>-PCB, were also identified (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>B). These results indicate that Arabidopsis plants could develop a mechanism by which spaceflight stresses, including microgravity, are transmitted to signaling pathways to be integrated into flowering regulation pathways.</p>
                <p>To test whether there are potential common cis-acting elements among these spaceflight responsive flowering genes, we performed analyses using Plant Regulomics (<uri>bioinfo.sibs.ac.cn/plant-regulomics</uri>) to find overrepresented motifs in the 1-kb upstream sequence of the overrepresented genes in these 53 flowering genes. Thirty coregulated genes were identified to share four common motifs, of which the occurrence was significantly high as compared to that in random genomic regions (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f010" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>C). These include (T/C)AAC (C/G)G, which is identical to MYB70 (AT2G23290) and MYB 65 (AT3G11440). The expression of genes regulated by MYB65 was consistent with roles in GA-mediated processes, with the expression of MYB 33 at the shoot apex coinciding with the onset of flowering [<xref rid="B30-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. C (A/GCCG (C/A)C represents the motif identified by the integrase-type DNA-binding superfamily protein (AT1G44830) encoding a member of the DREB subfamily A-5 of the transcription factor family, and the protein contains one AP2 domain, which plays an important role in plant flowering, seed development, and abiotic stress response [<xref rid="B32-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. AA (A/C) G is identical to the motif of DOF2.4 (AT2G37590) [<xref rid="B33-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This result indicates that common regulators might be involved in the regulation of plant flowering under spaceflight conditions.</p>

              <title>3. Discussion</title>
              <p>Microgravity in spaceflight is considered a special type of stress, which can significantly affect plant growth and development, including plant flowering. In this study, we have performed a seed-to-seed experiment on board the Chinese Spacelab TG-2. Image analyses suggested that <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> expression in the leaves of plants under spaceflight conditions was apparently changed in comparison with that in the ground controls. Our transcriptional data show that the alteration in responses of plants in space to temperature, circadian clock, and gibberellins could potentially affect their flowering regulation under spaceflight conditions.</p>
              <p>The recordings of growth and flowering time under the LD and SD conditions reported here under microgravity are unique, although earlier studies of seed-to-seed growth in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> have been performed in space [<xref rid="B17-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The problems related to embryo and seed development in space and the lower quality and quantity still remain [<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B36-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Damage caused during the flowering phase of a plant is irreversible and can cause reproductive failure [<xref rid="B6-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, a few space experiments so far have focused on this key developmental stage. Our study indicated that the initiation of bolting in Arabidopsis plants was delayed under the LD condition on board spaceflight. This result was confirmed by comparing the flowering time of the plants grown under SD firstly then transferring them to the LD condition in space with their ground controls. However, our result is different from a previous report, which suggested that the timing of bolting in Arabidopsis plants tended to be earlier in space on board the international space station (ISS) in comparison with the 1g space control [<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Different from our experiment, which was performed under the LD and SD conditions, Karahara et al.’s experiment was performed under a continuous light (LL) condition [<xref rid="B19-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Arabidopsis plants grown at high densities under LL were reported to have accelerated flowering times in comparison with LD and SD [<xref rid="B38-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Plants grown under LL conditions could be affected by a disruption of circadian rhythms without a light–dark cycle [<xref rid="B39-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We describe information in this study as to the effect of spaceflight factors on flowering time in Arabidopsis in space under two different typical daylength conditions, LD and SD, which are the key issues for vegetable and crop production in a closed cultivation system such as BLSS or a plant factory.</p>
              <p>Since the opportunity to conduct experiments in space is very limited, the application of living image in-flight and transgenic plants harboring the target genes is important to enhance scientific productivity by rapid feedback of results during missions and increase the on-board analysis capability. For example, transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene promoter linked to the ß-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene have been utilized to address various aspects of spaceflight-specific hypoxic stress in shuttle experiments [<xref rid="B41-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Using the GFP reporter gene system, Ferl and Paul (2015) analyzed the effect of spaceflight on the gravity-sensing auxin gradient of Arabidopsis roots [<xref rid="B43-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The present results extend the observation to the expression of the <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> gene under <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> promoter control in Arabidopsis transgenic plants in space. FT has great importance in vegetative and reproductive growth because several flowering pathways, including the long-day photoperiod, vernalization, autonomous promotion, and temperature-dependent pathways, are integrated into the regulation of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> expression [<xref rid="B23-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to downloaded images taken by online cameras, our study demonstrated that the expression rhythm of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> in Arabidopsis plants grown in space was unchanged, but the peak of <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> expression appeared later.</p>
              <p>Our results indicate that <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SOC1</italic>, which are in concert to initiate flowering, could act as integration hubs in the regulation pathways of plant flowering in response to spaceflight (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Consistent with the expression of <italic toggle="yes">GFP</italic> as described above, <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> in the leaves of spaceflight plants was also up-regulated at the time of flowering induction and is accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the circadian clock gene LHY and the photoperiodic gene SPA1. SOC1 is regulated by a complex transcriptional regulatory network that allows for the integration of multiple floral regulatory inputs from photoperiods, gibberellins, and FLOWERING LOCUS C [<xref rid="B44-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our result demonstrates that the expression of <italic toggle="yes">SOC1</italic> decreased in leaves under spaceflight conditions accompanied with the down-regulation of key genes involved in the response to the photoperiod, circadian clock, vernalization, ambient temperature, gibberellins, and aging. This indicates that the floral integration genes, <italic toggle="yes">FT</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SOC1</italic>, could be key genes for Arabidopsis plants to integrate spaceflight-condition stress signaling into flowering regulation pathways.</p>
              <p>Space experiments using different space vehicles have been a fascinating tool for understanding the effect of microgravity on plant growth and development. However, most of these experiments have focused on specific phenomena in the short term in space, such as gravitropism and gravimorphogensis, while relatively few studies have aimed to promote plant reproduction in space. After space missions become longer and there are permanently manned stations, the optimization of plant growth and reproduction becomes a requirement to finally set up a plant-basis self-sustained BLSS for long-duration human missions. In the design of plant-based BLSS, the final goal should not be the growth of plants in the short term, but the creation of stable conditions to guarantee plant growth and reproduction to reach the ambitious objective of realizing long-term, self-sustaining space habitats [<xref rid="B2-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. How to increase the production efficiency of plants will be the most important task in setting up a self-sustaining closed BLSS. Acceleration of flowering time in seed crops, such as rice and wheat, alongside the prevention of bolting in vegetable plants, would increase the input/output ratio of resources obtainable using plants in BLSS. Thus, the control of flowering time by manipulation will be an important biotechnological method to increase the production of BLSS. Our approach introduced new knowledge about the effect of spaceflight factors on plant flowering time. In the future, long-term space experiments from successive generations and systematic analysis of regulatory networks at the molecular level is needed to understand the mechanism of plant flowering control under microgravity (space) and fractional gravity, e.g., on the Moon, where the gravitational acceleration is 1/6 g, or on Mars at 3/8 g.</p>

                <p>Spaceflight experiments were conducted in a Plant Culture Box (PCB), which provides atmospheric, temperature, and hydration monitoring and control for the plant growth in the long term (the seed-to-seed experiment) as described by Wang et al. (2018) and Wu et al. (2020) [<xref rid="B9-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, the PCB consists of five culture chambers (CCs), including two CCs under short-day (SD, 8 h light /16 h dark) and three CCs under long-day (LD, 16 h light/8 h dark) conditions (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>A–D). Two digital cameras for visible image (Cam 1 and Cam2) and one digital camera for fluorescence image (Cam f) acquisition were installed in the PCB, allowing the recording of plants. The photographs of fluorescence images were taken by Cam f in 488 nm blue light through a 510 nm long pass filter with a light device. The cameras in PCB were automatic and preprogrammed and images were downloaded almost in real-time. Healthy seeds of WT, <italic toggle="yes">pFT::GFP,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ft-10</italic> were selected and surface-sterilized with 75% (<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) ethanol for 1 min, followed by 2% (<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) NaClO bleach with 0.01% (<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">v</italic>) Triton X-100 detergent for 20 min. After five rinses with sterile water, the seeds were attached to small pieces of cheesecloth (10 × 10 mm, five seeds per piece), then dried under a flow bench. The cheesecloth with seeds was set in the holes on the panel root module of the CC containing commercially available vermiculite (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B,E). The seeds in the CCs were stored dry for about 20 days prior to the launch of the spacelab TG-2 on 15 September 2016. The experiments were controlled remotely from the Beijing space center and initiated via hydration of the seeds on 23 September 2016. Germinated plants were grown at 21 ± 0.1 °C under the light of white/red (2:1) LEDs at 120 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Relative humidity was maintained at 88–98% (<xref rid="ijms-23-00063-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>F).

After being grown for 48 days on board TG-2, one of the LD CCs with Arabidopsis plants was taken out from the PCB by an astronaut and fixed with the RNAlater solution for transcriptomic analysis on the ground.

Gene Ontology (GO) overrepresentation was performed using PANTHER (Fisher’s Exact type with False Discovery Rate correction) (<uri xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org">http://www.pantherdb.org</uri>, accessed on 9 July 2021, 16.0 released) [<xref rid="B48-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. For motif enrichment, motifscan was used to determine whether the occurrence of a given motif in input genes was significantly high as compared to that in random regions [<xref rid="B49-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijms-23-00063" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For the analysis of the FT and SOC1 protein interaction network in response to spaceflight conditions, data of different expression proteins were used as queries against the string database (<uri xlink:href="http://strigdb.org">http://strigdb.org</uri>, accessed on 9 July 2021) to identify protein–protein interactions. Scores were downloaded and exported to Cytoscape (version 3.8.0, San Diego, CA, USA) for network diagrams.</p>
