                <p>Reactivation of latent herpes viruses was measured in 23 astronauts (18 male and 5 female) before, during, and after long-duration (up to 180 days) spaceflight onboard the international space station . Twenty age-matched and sex-matched healthy ground-based subjects were included as a control group. Blood, urine, and saliva samples were collected before, during, and after spaceflight. Saliva was analyzed for Epstein–Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and herpes simplex virus type 1. Urine was analyzed for cytomegalovirus. One astronaut did not shed any targeted virus in samples collected during the three mission phases. Shedding of Epstein–Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus was detected in 8 of the 23 astronauts. These viruses reactivated independently of each other. Reactivation of Epstein–Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus increased in frequency, duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to short duration (10 to 16 days) space shuttle missions. No evidence of reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, or human herpes virus 6 was found. The mean diurnal trajectory of salivary cortisol changed significantly during flight as compared to before flight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010). There was no statistically significant difference in levels of plasma cortisol or dehydoepiandosterone concentrations among time points before, during, and after flight for these international space station crew members, although observed cortisol levels were lower at the mid and late-flight time points. The data confirm that astronauts undertaking long-duration spaceflight experience both increased latent viral reactivation and changes in diurnal trajectory of salivary cortisol concentrations.</p>

                <title>Virus reactivation in long-duration spaceflight</title>
                <p>Long-duration spaceflight increases the reactivation of latent herpes viruses in astronauts and is accompanied by a rise in stress hormone levels. This study shows that the frequency and viral loads of reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus were even greater in blood, urine, and saliva samples from astronauts staying 60 to 180 days onboard the International Space Station than has previously been observed for short-duration (10–16 days) missions. Changes in viral reactivation were also found to be associated with changes in the daily trajectory of salivary cortisol during these long-duration missions. These results indicate that the effects of the microgravity environment on the immune system are increased with prolonged exposure and highlight the potential increased risk of infection among crewmembers.</p>

              <p>Increased reactivation of some naturally occurring latent herpes viruses including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) was previously demonstrated in astronauts during short-duration (10–16 days) space shuttle flights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> However, following reactivation, viruses were shed in body fluids and the astronauts were typically asymptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Stress responses associated with spaceflight include activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and may result in the reactivation of latent herpes viruses subjecting astronauts to risk of shedding live, infectious viruses during spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Cortisol and dehydoepiandosterone (DHEA) may affect regulation of cellular immunity resulting in reactivation of latent viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Responses to reactivation of herpes viruses can be asymptomatic, debilitating, or even life-threatening. Isolation of crewmembers before flight has no mitigating effect on latent virus reactivation. Even a complete quarantine does not prevent viral reactivation during spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> The goal of this study was to determine whether long-duration (up to180 days) spaceflight aboard the international space station (ISS) would allow astronauts to acclimate to spaceflight and mitigate the impact of spaceflight associated stressors on crewmembers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> In the present study, viral reactivation and shedding of EBV, VZV, CMV, HSV1, and human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) were measured in 23 US astronauts before, during, and immediately following long duration spaceflight. Recently, immune changes were shown to persist during and after long-duration ISS missions in the same participants as studied in the present virus study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> In an environment of immune dysfunction, our hypothesis is that viral reactivation and shedding of these herpes viruses will also increase in astronauts during long-duration space flight as observed in ground-based space analogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>

                <title>Viral reactivation</title>
                <p>Twenty-two of 23 astronauts shed one or more target viruses (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Fifteen astronauts shed VZV, 22 shed EBV, and 14 shed CMV at one or more time points before, during, or after spaceflight (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). One astronaut did not shed any virus during any defined collection time. By contrast, none of the 20 control subjects shed VZV or CMV and only 2 of them shed EBV (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). No astronauts or control subjects shed HSV1, HSV2, or HHV6 at any time throughout the study. Percent shedding among crewmembers with 95% binomial confidence intervals are shown for EBV, VZV, and CMV in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. For these three viruses, there was considerable variation of the shedding percentages over the collection time points (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) suggesting a possible overall mission effect on the reactivation of these viruses. More formally, when comparing copy numbers between time points, the Friedman test did not show a significant difference between time points for EBV (<italic>P</italic> = 0.064). Indeed, EBV was shed at all seven sample collection time points (Two before, three during, and two after flight). For VZV, no shedding occurred at both 180 days and 45 days before flight but shedding was found in early, mid, and late time points during flight as well as at landing and 30 days after landing (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The Friedman test comparing copy number distributions was significant for VZV (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found significantly more VZV reactivation in the late-flight time period than either pre-flight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.011) or 30d-post-flight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.035). There was no CMV shedding at 180 days before flight but there was CMV shedding 45 days before, during, and after flight. The Friedman test comparing copy numbers for CMV was also significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In particular, also after adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found that this was due to increased CMV shedding during flight which was significantly greater than 180 days before flight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013) and also greater than 30 days after flight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.041). Even when the time points with no shedding were excluded from the analysis, there were still significant differences between the remaining time points; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0027 (VZV) and <italic>P</italic> = 0.0008 (CMV) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Salivary VZV, Salivary EBV and urinary CMV copies in the 23 international space station crewmembers before, during and after the flight</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>S.

                <p>With natural log cortisol concentration as outcome, there was some evidence that daily mean trajectories for each of the three during-flight periods differed from the trajectories before flight (unadjusted <italic>P</italic> = 0.069, 0.022, 0.086 by mixed-model regression on log cortisol concentration values for early-flight vs. before-flight, mid-flight vs. before-flight, and late-flight vs. before-flight, respectively). However, the flight periods did not differ significantly between themselves (<italic>P</italic> = 0.132). After combining data across the three flight periods and comparing the mean daily trajectory during flight with pre-flight, we found evidence for an effect of flight (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010, see Appendix).

Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> shows the predicted mean daily trajectory of log cortisol concentration before flight and during flight with 95% confidence limits.

              <p>This is the first study of reactivation of multiple latent herpes viruses in astronauts during long-duration spaceflight (60–180 days). We have previously shown a direct correlation of immune changes and viral reactivation in a study of 17 astronauts during short-duration (10–16 days) spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> In those subjects, substantial changes in cell-mediated immunity were found in most astronauts that reactivated one or more of the target herpes viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Glaser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> previously showed association of EBV reactivation and diminished cell-mediated immunity.</p>
              <p>Short-duration spaceflight onboard the space shuttle is a unique experience that includes a unique set of stressors that contribute to the dysregulation of immune and endocrine systems).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Astronauts on ISS missions experience many similar stressors for a much longer duration. Recent studies confirmed that astronauts on the ISS continue to experience dysregulation of immune and endocrine systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Increased levels of plasma and urinary stress hormones (cortisol, and catecholamines) commonly accompany spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>Virus reactivation was shown to be associated with the unique combination of stressors associated with spaceflight which include psychosocial stressors of isolation, confinement, anxiety, sleep deprivation, as well as physical exertion, noise, increased radiation, and microgravity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> These stressors may be constant or intermittent. It has been previously suggested that during 4–6 months of spaceflight, astronauts onboard the ISS would acclimate to the unique environment resulting in the recovery of the immune system to normal levels. Therefore, the immune and viral reactivation observations during 10–16 days space shuttle missions may not occur in crewmembers of 4–6 month missions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Normal immune activity is likely to prevent or mitigate the shedding of the herpes viruses (with exception of EBV) as observed in control subjects. Data in the present study demonstrate that shedding of EBV, CMV, and VZV did not abate during the longer missions onboard the ISS. Rather, virus shedding actually increased in frequency and amplitude (viral copy numbers) of all three viruses tested. As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, VZV shedding increased from 41% in short duration space shuttle to 65% in long duration ISS, EBV increased from 82 to 96%, and CMV increased from 47 to 61% of the crewmembers. Also, shedding for all three viruses persisted throughout the long duration (Early, Mid, and Late) missions. In addition, VZV and CMV shed up to 30 days after longer-duration spaceflight on the ISS unlike for the short-duration spaceflight on the space shuttle where VZV was shed only up to 5 days and CMV shed up to 3 days after flight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> In a recent study, it was reported that immune changes observed in short duration spaceflight actually increased in astronauts after 6 months of ISS flight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>EBV infects approximately 90% of human adults, and 100% of all astronauts (<italic>n</italic> = 86) studied to date were seropositive for EBV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> In this study, all but one of the 23 astronauts studied shed EBV at some time point. VZV is an important health risk to crewmembers (some have experienced shingles before or during the course of spaceflight), and CMV can be immuno-suppressive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> CMV may play a role in immune dysfunction observed in crewmembers. Viral reactivation has been reported in ground-based models of spaceflight although to a lesser extent than spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Previously, we have shown that the VZV shed in saliva by crewmembers contains live, infectious virus capable of infecting other crew members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> However, if crewmembers have had exposure to VZV, it is not likely to re-infect but they may spread live infectious virus to immunocompromised or sero-negative individuals with whom they come in contact during or after the flight. Reactivation of VZV can result in shingles or other serious health issues that can compromise mission objectives.</p>
              <p>EBV shedding was found in 3% of control subjects while VZV and CMV were found in less than 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Even though the exact mechanism of virus shedding in saliva of astronauts during flight is not fully understood, increased stress and reduced immunity are important contributory factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> VZV is a neurotropic virus that does not appear in saliva of normal healthy subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> However, stressful conditions such as spaceflight can reactivate this virus to replicate in the dorsal root ganglia, and shedding occurs in saliva.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>
</p>
              <p>The apparent higher salivary cortisol profile predicted in diurnal cortisol (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) is similar to dysregulation associated with psychosocial challenges such as chronic caregiving stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> early trauma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Herein with longitudinal sampling during the course of extended space flight, there were indications of disruption in cortisol levels reflected by a higher diurnal level at mid-day. Our previous report for short-term space flight suggested that cortisol levels remained unchanged when applying a different metric, area under the curve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> These differences could be due to the impact of longer exposure to microgravity,radiation, work load, and psychological factors operating in longer missions. Furthermore, in the MARS500 investigation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> no relevant shedding was observed during or after isolation, again suggesting the impact of spaceflight (in particular, long-duration spaceflight) as a key contributor to the current findings. The lack of psychological assessments addressing stress levels in crewmembers is a limitation of the present study. Additonally the inability to precisely time each sample collection within a 24-h cycle, limits our capacity to speculate on sources of midday increases. Improved documentation of daily activities on when saliva was collected would contribute significantly to interpreting these observations. However the contraints in collection from rigidly scheduled crewmembers precludes collecting additional information of this nature.</p>
              <p>Controlling the reactivation of latent herpes viruses is among the numerous functions of T cells. Percentages of virus-specific T cells have been found to be elevated after short-duration spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> An investigation of immunity after short duration space shuttle missions found no significant increases in the absolute levels of peptide-specific EBV or CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets, including cytotoxic, central memory, and senescent; T-cell function; and cytokine production profiles were altered during short-duration spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> The functional capacity of virus-specific T cells during this previous study was in fact decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p>Previously, we showed that at least three latent herpes reactivate and shed in astronauts during short-term spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Changes in immunity were also observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and provided a likely mechanistic cause for reactivation of latent viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> This study was undertaken to determine if the longer duration missions resulted in a reduction in stress effects and restored viral immunity thus preventing or mitigating the reactivation of these viruses. Unfortunately, in this long duration (6 months) ISS study, immune status did not improve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and consequently, reactivation of EBV, VZV, and CMV actually increased in frequency, duration, and amplitude (viral copy numbers) when compared to values found with short-duration spaceflight. The viruses studied reactivated independently of each other. These findings could impact the design of exploration-class missions during which reactivation of latent viruses could result in an increased risk of wide-ranging adverse medical events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> It may be however, that a partial-gravity environment, e.g., on Mars, would be sufficient to prevent serious viral reactivation. Future research needs to address this question. For now, we conclude that because astronaut’s saliva has significantly increased shedding of VZV DNA during and after spaceflight and this virus has been shown to be infectious in an earlier study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> vaccination of crewmembers with VZV vaccine (zostavax) may be recommended as a countermeasure to the astronauts before they go in space.</p>

                <p>Twenty-three ISS astronauts (18 male and 5 female; mean age + SE = 53 + 4.9 years) participated in this observational study. These study participants are the same individuals that participated in a recent immune study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Informed consent was obtained from all subjects who participated in the study and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. The nominal mission duration was approximately 180 days. Two crewmembers participated in shorter missions of approximately 2–3 months. For those crewmembers; only two samplings occurred during flight, with data aligned with the ‘early’ and ‘mid’ for the 6-month crewmembers.</p>
                <p>Twenty apparently healthy age—and gender matched subjects (16 males and 4 females, mean age ± SE of 49.3 ± 4.9 years) participated as ground-based viral reactivation controls. With the exception of the diurnal saliva collections, the control subjects were sampled and processed at the same time for the same assays as the ISS crewmembers. All astronauts and control subjects were EBV, CMV, VZV, and HSV-1 seropositive as tested by measuring IgG with an ELISA based commercial assay at baseline (180 days before flight) assessment. A total of 1044 samples from 23 astronauts were collected before, during and after long-duration spaceflight on the ISS and were analyzed upon return to Earth. Saliva accounted for 644 samples, 207 samples were urine, and 193 were blood samples. Saliva samples were assayed for EBV, VZV, and HSV-1/2 and HHV6; urine samples were analyzed for CMV. This study was observational and exploratory, making use of all data from participating astronauts, and as such was not designed to achieve any particular level of power for detecting pre-specified effects, nor could this work be replicated in a laboratory setting.</p>
