              <p>Microgravity is known to affect many physiological functions on the exposed organisms, which react to the altered environment adapting the tissue and cellular behavior. When compared to the on-ground force of gravity (1<italic>g</italic>), the microgravity conditions are able to induce a variety of alterations of the structural organization of the cells consequent to epigenetic modifications as well as modulation of gene expression and enzymatic activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Simulated microgravity, obtained in the laboratory setting through the use of a Random Positioning Machine (RPM), represents a well recognized and useful tool for the experimental studies of the cellular adaptations and molecular alterations induced by the weightlessness stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The human skin is a peripheral tissue highly exposed to environmental changes and its epidermal keratinocyte components are known to be characterized by the presence of a functional molecular clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. We have very recently shown that short exposure to the simulated microgravitational environment influences the circadian clock oscillation of human keratinocytes, without interfering with the actin cytoskeleton organization and the proliferation or apoptotic rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These results have been interpreted in light of the existence of an integrated signaling network coupling mechano-sensitive pathways to gene regulation and transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the expression profiles of many different genes of human keratinocytes are affected under exposure to simulated microgravity in a time-dependent manner and during recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, it has been recently reported that long term exposure to microgravity conditions is able to affect mouse skin homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, mostly inducing expression modulations of those genes responsible for remodeling of the extracellular matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and leading to dermal atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>: however, the physiological behaviour of the epidermal keratinocytes and their molecular pattern did not appear significantly altered in such environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, in the present paper, we searched for changes on the regenerative ability and response to tissue damage of human epidermal cells through the analysis of the effects of the simulated microgravity on the repair process. Combining different morphological and molecular approaches, we found that the simulated microgravity exposure of human keratinocytes may affect tissue repair promoting the re-epithelialization phase of the wound healing process, triggering the complex set of events defined epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which the epithelial cells acquire a typical migratory phenotype of mesenchymal cells due to reprogramming of gene expression and appearance of specific markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity changes the migratory behavior of human keratinocytes</title>
                <p>Because the wound healing process requires the proliferative and migratory activity of the keratinocytes and it has been proposed that the expression of several growth factors and cytokines is modulated by microgravity upon wound repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, here we analyzed in detail the possible effects of simulated microgravity on the motility and repairing properties of human keratinocytes. To this aim, we used human immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes, a widely utilized cell model to study epidermal physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, used also in a very recent study of our group focused on the effects of microgravity on the circadian clock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here we evaluated first the impact of simulated microgravity exposure on the spontaneous keratinocyte motility using the “scratch assay”. The scratch was performed on confluent HaCaT cultures and cells were exposed to simulated microgravity on the RPM or kept at 1<italic>g</italic> as control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). After 24 hours from the scratch we observed an enhancement of cell migration during simulated microgravity treatment respect to the cells kept at 1<italic>g</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Automated analysis using TScratch software clearly showed differences in migration properties calculated as percentage of the open surface residual area respect to 100% (300 μm) at the initial time points T<sub>0</sub> of each condition (1<italic>g</italic> or μ<italic>g</italic>): in fact, in simulated microgravity exposed cells, the percentage of the open surface area was much lower compared to control cells (3% Vs 12%; ** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Simulated microgravity exposure enhances cell migration and induces invasiveness in human keratinocytes. (<bold>a</bold>) HaCaT cells were grown until confluence and allowed to migrate for 24 hours (T<sub>24</sub>) under simulated microgravity (μ<italic>g</italic>) or normal gravity (1<italic>g</italic>) in a cell-free scratch area. The closure of the scratch area is higher in cells exposed to μ<italic>g</italic> respect to cells kept at 1<italic>g</italic>. Cell migration was calculated as reported in methods (n = 3). (<bold>b</bold>) HaCaT cells were kept at 1<italic>g</italic> or exposed to μ<italic>g</italic> for 24 hours. Cells were then seeded on uncoated (upper panels) or matrigel pre-coated (lower panels) transwell Boyden chambers and complete medium was added in the bottom chamber for chemotactic stimulation for 24 hours. Cell migration (upper panels) and invasion (lower panels) are significantly increased in μ<italic>g</italic> cultures compared to control cells. Quantitative analysis was assessed as reported in methods and results expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) (n-4). Student’s <italic>t</italic> test was performed and significance level has been defined as follows: **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs the control cells (1<italic>g</italic>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2017_602_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e469"/></fig>
</p>
                <p>Then we investigated the migration induced by chemotactic stimulation under simulated microgravity. To this aim we analyzed the capacity of HaCaT cells, kept at 1<italic>g</italic> or exposed to simulated microgravity for 24 hours, to migrate through transwell Boyden chamber filters when complete medium was added in the bottom chamber for chemotactic stimulation. The results showed an increase of cell migration, evaluated by counting the cell number/field, in the chambers exposed to simulated microgravity compared to control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, top panels). Thus, simulated microgravity exposure induced keratinocyte cell migration. Based on this finding, we investigated the possible effect of simulated microgravity in triggering not only migration but invasive ability of the HaCaT cells which are known to be non invasive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. To this aim we analyzed if simulated microgravity exposed cells as above could migrate through the transwell Boyden chambers pre-coated with a thin layer of matrigel, a gel composed of reconstituted basement membrane elements resembling the basement membrane <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results, evaluated as above, showed detection of cell invasion only in simulated microgravity exposed keratinocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, bottom panels).</p>
                <p>Taken together our results revealed that simulated microgravity exposure was able to enhance the migration and to trigger the invasion of human keratinocytes.</p>

              <sec id="Sec4">
                <title>The proliferation or apoptosis of the keratinocytes are not affected by the exposure to the simulated microgravity</title>
                <p>In order to better clarify our results on the migratory and invasive effects of the simulated microgravity, we wanted to rule out the possibility that cell proliferation or apoptosis could contribute to the repopulation of the wounded area. The growth ability of the simulated microgravity treated cells respect to those kept at 1<italic>g</italic> was assessed at the same time point used for the motility experiments. The proliferation assay showed no significant differences in the increase of cell number at 24 hours upon simulated microgravity exposure respect to control cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). We evaluated also the cell cycle in simulated microgravity treated cellsand controls: cytofluorimetric analysis showed that the cell cycle was not significantly influenced by the exposure as shown by the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S and G2/M phases (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). To exclude also the possible contribution of changes in cell apoptosis in our experiments, the Annexin V assay has been done. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>, bottom panels, the apoptotic rates induced by camptothecin treatment, used as positive control, were similar in cells exposed to simulated microgravity or kept at 1<italic>g</italic>. In addition, mitotic spindles and midbodies were counted along the entire z axis of equivalent areas occupied by the cells in control and simulated microgravity conditions, either in areas where cells were confluent or in regions of the scratch gap (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>). Again, we did not detect significant differences in the number of mitotic cells/fields in all cultural conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>). These findings clearly indicate that the more rapid wound closure on simulated microgravity environment was not due to a major proliferative activity or decreased apoptotic rate, but to an enhanced migratory capacity.</p>

                <title>Simulated microgravity induces the cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell migration</title>
                <p>To investigate the cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton during the keratinocyte migration when occurring under simulated microgravity, fluorescence analysis was performed in cells exposed to simulated microgravity or kept at 1<italic>g</italic> as a control using TRITC-conjugated phalloidin, to visualize the F-actin cytoskeleton organization on the scratch test as above. The results confirmed that, in simulated microgravity treated cells at 24 hours from the scratch, the wound area was completely sealed, while only sparse migrating cells were evident in the wound area of 1<italic>g</italic> cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). However, to appreciate in detail the actin cytoskeletal organization, the phalloidin fluorescence was performed also on cells exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 hours and grown in conditions of semi-confluence. Fluorescence analysis showed that the organization of the cells in untreated conditions remained, as expected, cobblestone-shaped, maintaining the actin cytoskeleton distribution in peripheral cortical bundles characteristic of the cultured epidermal keratinocytes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, top panels). In simulated microgravity exposed cells, in addition to the cortical bundles, lamellipodia and ruffles were frequently observed, particularly in the cells located at the periphery of the colonies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> lower panels, arrows).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Simulated microgravity exposure affects keratinocyte growth mode and their morphology during migration.

                <p>The observed protrusions are known to be formed by an actin assembling process involving many proteins such as the fascin, a protein essential for the generation and maintenance of tight F-actin bundles of filopodia and to cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, immunofluorescence analysis of fascin staining was performed and quantitative evaluation of the signal intensity was assessed: the results clearly indicated an increase of fascin expression in cells exposed to simulated microgravity in comparison to control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Taken together, our findings showed that simulated microgravity was able to cause, in human keratinocytes under the scratch assay, the appearance of morphological features and cytoskeletal reorganization consistent with the migratory and invasive behavior.</p>

                <title>Modulation of EMT markers is induced by simulated microgravity</title>
                <p>Since the triggering of migratory and invasive properties involves a process named epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), we wondered whether the phenotypic changes observed under simulated microgravity exposure would be associated to the expression of well recognized epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers of EMT.</p>
                <p>First, we investigated by western blot analysis the modulation of the expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and of the cytoskeletal components α-SMA, vimentin and fascin. The results clearly showed a reduction of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the appearance of typical mesenchymal markers like vimentin and α-SMA in simulated microgravity treated cells respect to cells kept at 1g (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The evaluation of E-cadherin was further supported by the observed decrease of E-cadherin fragment, resulting from the cleavage of E-cadherin (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>). In agreement with the immunofluorescence results reported above, the protein expression of fascin was increased in cells exposed to simulated microgravity compared to control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Simulated microgravity induces EMT in keratinocytes.

(<bold>a</bold>) Western blot analysis shows, in μ<italic>g</italic> cells, a reduction of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and an increase of fascin and of the mesenchymal markers α-SMA and vimentin as well as of the EMT-related transcription factor Snail1. The equal loading was assessed using anti-β actin antibody. For the densitometric analysis, the values were normalized, expressed as fold increase and reported in graph as mean value ± SD (n = 3). (<bold>b</bold>) RT-PCR in cells treated as above shows that the mRNA transcript levels of Snail1, Snail2 and <italic>ZEB2</italic> and N-cadherin are increased in simulated microgravity-treated cells compared to controls.

</p>
                <p>During the EMT process, the gene reprogramming required to obtain the mesenchymal-like phenotype involves several transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. One of the most important transcription factor involved in EMT induction is Snail1, associated with the initiation of the process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In simulated microgravity exposed cells, Snail1 appeared to be expressed at both protein and mRNA levels more than in control cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). In addition, we evaluated by RT-PCR other biomarkers involved in EMT: the transcription factors positively regulated during the EMT process, Snail2 and <italic>ZEB2</italic>, were more expressed in simulated microgravity treated cells respect to the control cells. The transcript levels of the mesenchymal protein N-cadherin, which is generally induced in its expression during EMT, were higher in the simulated microgravity treated cells compared with cells kept at 1<italic>g</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Taken all together these results strongly suggest that simulated microgravity was capable to trigger EMT in keratinocytes.</p>
                <p>The metalloproteases (MMPs), which play a key role in wound healing, are known to be expressed by migrating and proliferating keratinocytes during the re-epithelization process. In particular, <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic> expression and release enhance the invasive properties of the cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In order to evaluate the mRNA expression, RT-PCR was performed on cells treated for 24 and 60 hours in simulated microgravity and at 1<italic>g</italic>: at 24 hours, our results showed an increase of mRNA expression for <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic> but a decrease for <italic>MMP3</italic>. However, after 60 hours of exposure, the transcript levels of all the metalloproteases measured (<italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP2</italic>, <italic>MMP3</italic>, <italic>MMP9</italic>) were increased compared with those of cells kept at 1<italic>g</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). A further confirmation of what has been observed in RT-PCR experiments was obtained by western blot analysis of the protein expression of <italic>MMP1</italic> and MMP3, showing an increase in cells exposed to simulated microgravity respect to control cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>). Since metalloproteases are highly regulated not only in their expression, but mostly in their enzymatic activity, which can also be controlled by proteinase inhibitors, we evaluated by zymography the activities of <italic>MMP2</italic> and <italic>MMP9</italic> in cells treated as above. Although we found a significant increase of enzyme activity only for <italic>MMP9</italic> in cells exposed to simulated microgravity compared to controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), our findings may suggest that microgravity was able to induce enhanced degradation of the extracellular matrix required for the cell motility.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Simulated microgravity exposure modulates the expression and the enzymatic activity of metalloproteases.

              <p>Wounds of the skin are known to generate a mechanical stretch on the marginal epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are able to trigger the healing response through activation of mechano-signal transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Microgravity exposure affects the cell behavior changing the mechanical environment and, therefore, it allows to study the response to mechanical forces and their signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, we wondered if the mechanical environment induced by simulated microgravity would affect the repair and wound healing process through the acquisition by the keratinocytes of a motile and invasive mesenchymal phenotypes. We showed that simulated microgravity exposure of human keratinocytes is able to enhance cell migration either spontaneous, as assessed by the migration assay, or induced by chemotactic stimulation through the filter pores of transwell Boyden chambers. These results not only are consistent with the published observations that keratinocyte migration is improved under mechanical stretch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, but also reveal that this migratory response is the consequence of the expression of some genes, such as Snail1, Snail2 and <italic>ZEB2</italic>, and transcriptional regulation of others, such as those of <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP2</italic>, <italic>MMP9</italic> and N-cadherin, which are characteristics of the EMT process. Complete gene expression profiling in human keratinocytes has been previously reported and showed extensive transcriptional up- or down-regulation induced by simulated microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>: however, comparing to our present results, that analysis pointed only to the clusters of genes more differentially modulated and the length of exposure, starting from 3 days, was longer than in our experimental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton is known to be altered by both real and simulated microgravity in many human cell types, including chondrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and different cytoskeletal proteins, components of the intermediate filaments, actin bundles and microtubules, are changed in their expression under microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Consistent with those studies, our results showed that simulated microgravity was able to cause, in human keratinocytes under the scratch assay, the acquisition of morphological features and cytoskeletal reorganization consistent with the migratory and invasive behavior, such as the appearance of α-SMA and vimentin, usually absent in epithelial cells, as well as the enhanced expression of fascin, a protein essential for the filopodia structure and for cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
              <p>The exposure of cells to decreased gravity is known to induce alterations of the biological behavior affecting proliferation and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, but we have shown in a previous study of our group that, at least in the cell model used and in the experimental condition tested, the proliferative and apoptotic rates were similar in cells exposed to simulated microgravity compared to 1<italic>g</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Here we showed again that the proliferation or apoptosis of the keratinocytes did not appear to be affected by the simulated microgravity environment in our experimental conditions, further indicating that the more rapid scratch closure could not be ascribed to a major proliferative activity or decreased apoptotic rate, but to a real enhanced migratory capacity.</p>
              <p>The EMT process is a starting event in wound healing and involves the cellular acquisition of a motile mesenchymal phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We have recently reported that, in both HaCaT cells and primary cultured human keratinocytes, EMT can be triggered by the isoform switching of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (<italic>FGFR2</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, a key regulator of the re-epithelialization during wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, we might propose that the migratory ability and the cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell migration, as observed in our present <italic>in vitro</italic> study, would presumably correspond to a stimulatory effect of the microgravity on the <italic>in vivo</italic> wound healing.</p>
              <p>Finally, prolonged exposure to altered gravity of mice kept aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and extensive transcriptomic analysis of their skin samples have shown that the major cutaneous alteration is the dermal atrophy, possibly due to an imbalance between synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Since the dermal fibroblasts, which are responsible for matrix deposition and degradation, are finely regulated in their function by several paracrine mediators released by the epidermal cells, we may suggest that the microgravity-triggered EMT of the keratinocytes, occurring shortly after exposure, would affect at longer times the dermal homeostasis and its adaptive response.</p>

                <title>PCR amplification and real-time quantitation</title>
                <p>RT-PCR was carried out in 96-well plate using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the iCycler Real-Time Detection System (iQ5; Bio-Rad). The thermal cycling programme was performed as follow: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Melting curves were performed for each primer pair. The relative quantification of gene expression was assessed by comparative threshold cycle method (2<sup>−DDCT</sup>), including normalization of the gene expression to ribosomal 18S RNA, whose expression remains stable in all experimental conditions. All experiments have been done in triplicate and are reported as mean ± SD.</p>

                <p>Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Data were statistically analyzed with unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. Differences were considered significant at the level of p &lt; 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Instat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.; San Diego, CA, USA).</p>
