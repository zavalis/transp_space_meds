                <p>Alterations in the control of apoptotic processes were observed in cells during space flight or under simulated microgravity, the latter obtained with the 3D-Random Positioning Machine (3D-RPM).</p>
                <p>Usually the proteins Bax and Bcl-2, act as pro- or anti-apoptotic regulators. Here we investigated the effects of simulated microgravity obtained by the 3D-RPM on cell viability, localization and expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in cultures of glial cancerous cells. We observed for the first time a transient cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation of Bax and Bcl-2 triggered by changing gravity vector. Bax translocates into the nucleus after 1 h, is present simultaneously in the cytoplasm after 6 h and comes back to the cytoplasm after 24 h. Bcl-2 translocate into the nucleus only after 6 h and comes back to the cytoplasm after 24 h. Physiological meaning, on the regulation of apoptotic event and possible applicative outcomes of such finding are discussed.</p>

              <p id="p0010">Manned space flight and longstanding utilization of the International Space Station motivate biologists to understand whether and how microgravity (μg) represents a threaten to living organisms, including human beings. According to results obtained on astronauts, weightlessness induces a series of pathophysiological changes, some of which involving the nervous system [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0015">Studies at the cellular level during space flight showed a series of alterations occurring in the cytoskeleton of lymphocytes and macrophages as well as in cells or tissue culture [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0020">In rats flown in space for 9 days, motor neurons and glial cells of anterior horns from cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord showed shape alterations and decreased cytochrome-oxidase activity providing evidence of impaired function <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, to understand whether μg represents a crucial factor for any organisms, it is crucial to investigate upon the biological effects of altered gravity on cells.</p>
              <p id="p0025">Due to the costs and time limitation of space flight, various methods have been used to simulate the biological effects of μg on Earth. The 3D-RPM is one of the most useful devices with respect to that. It simulates some of the physical effects of space flight by providing a vector averaged reduction (10<sup>−6</sup>g) of the apparent gravity without generating significant shear forces <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The equipment is supplemented with a computer-assisted electronic controller driving the RPM motors according to a correct “angular walk speed”. Hoson and coworkers (1997) <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> validated the 3D-RPM method by comparing the results obtained under real μg with those obtained under 3D-RPM on plant cell endoplasmic reticulum.</p>
              <p id="p0030">Takeda and coworkers (2009) <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, using three different human malignant glioma cell lines (D54MG, U251MG, T98G), demonstrated that all cancer cell lines exposed for three days to simulated microgravity shown a decrease of the cell growth, but the mechanisms of cell cycle blocked are unclear. Furthermore, in all three cell lines exposed to simulated microgravity, cytoskeleton and mitochondria changes and apoptosis increase was observed <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Some of us already reported upon cytoskeletal changes and apoptotic phenomena occurring in glial cells as a result of simulated μg, using 3D-RPM method [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0035">Mitochondrial activity is a critical point in cell surviving and physiological activity, and its functional integrity is elective site on which the apoptotic process act to induce cell to die. In particular, the relationship between apoptosis and mitochondrial activity involves two important proteins, Bax and Bcl-2. If a critical cellular condition has been reached, these proteins regulate apoptosis process by their action on mitochondria: Bcl-2 suppresses apoptosis, whereas Bax induce apoptosis: they act throughout homodimerization and heterodimerization with each other [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p>
              <p id="p0040">Bcl-2 behaves as antiapoptotic factor in cancer cells treated by a variety of anticancer agents having as purpose to induce apoptosis. These drugs act damaging cellular microtubules by induction Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation and reduction of Bax-Bcl-2 heterodimerization, that results in a cell block in G2 phase [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These findings indicate a close relationship between Bcl-2 and microtubular network.</p>
              <p id="p0045">In response to apoptotic stimuli, Bax dimerizes and changes its subcellular localization moving from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However several studies have observed Bax nuclear translocation during apoptosis [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], suggesting that Bax loses its function when is translocated into the nucleus <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0050">Bcl-2 also appears overexpressed inside the nuclear compartment in HeLa cells in association with glutathione during aging and in case of oxidative stress, suggesting that some of its functions require the ability to get anchored to nucleus membranes [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In summary, both Bcl-2 and Bax proteins have been found within the cell nucleus in various cell lines <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, suggesting that they may become a nuclear matrix-associated protein <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0055">However, in simulated microgravity, the role of these two proteins, involved in the mitochondrial apoptosis, are controversial. In fact, many authors demonstrated that, in simulated microgravity, it showed a reduction BCL-2 and increment BAX gene expression in endothelial cells <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, in human osteoblastic cells <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and in carcinoma cells <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Instead, other authors didn't not observed alteration between Bax-Bcl-2 ratio <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> or another found increased the level of both protein in human endothelial cells <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0060">We advance the hypothesis that nucleus translocation movements of Bax and or Bcl-2, may have hidden their detection, making enigmatic the apoptotic response by simulate microgravity.</p>
              <p id="p0065">Moving on the previous findings on glial cells, in the present work, we have focused our study on C6 glioma cells as experimental in vitro model, where Bax and Bcl-2 expression and translocation by simulated microgravity was detected and analysed. A tumoral cell line was taken in account to avoid the apoptotic phenomenon of anoikis to which non-cancerous cells may be subjected <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>

Pellicciari, University of Pavia, Italy, were grown in D-MEM Medium (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) with the addition of 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% Non-essential amino acids and were cultured in an incubator at the temperature of 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
              <p id="p0075">For experimental conditions, C6 cells were seeded, at 20.000 cells/ml using the “slide flask” method (flasks apposed onto tight-fitting removable slides, 9.0 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
              <p id="p0080"><italic>Simulated Microgravity.</italic> Cells were seeded as monolayer cultures in slide flasks, which were subsequently fitted onto a special machinery called 3D Random Positioning Machine (3D RPM, Dutch Space) and kept under continuous rotation at 56°/s, at the temperature of 37 °C, for 1h, 6h and 24h (simulated μg). The flasks (completely filled with medium) are placed close to the centre of rotation to minimize centrifugal accelerations.</p>
              <p id="p0085">Frame controls (F, 1xg) were placed on the frame supporting the RPM to have the cells exposed to any vibrations eventually produced and transmitted by the rotating machinery to the supporting structure until analysed at the same time points. Another control cell group, Ground controls (g, 1xg) were kept in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and sham-treated in parallel, namely just kept in place until analysed at the same time points as well. At the end of each experiment, the flasks were washed with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and then the cells fixed with Paraformaldehyde at 4%. Nine flasks were used to obtain cells for RT-PCR and nine flasks for Western Blot.</p>
              <p id="p0090">As F and g cell groups did not statistically differ from each other in terms of any of the parameters analysed thereafter, the paper always uses the terms “1xg” or “control” samples by referring invariably to frame controls. Having a static condition as a control group, as done in most experiments, does not allow one to separate gravitational from fluid dynamic effects.</p>
              <p id="p0095"><italic>Immunofluorescence.</italic> After being removed from flasks, the slides containing cultured cells underwent indirect immunofluorescence. After permeabilization with 0,1% Triton X-100 (Sigma in PBS, PBS washing and exposure to Normal Goat Serum (diluted 1:50 in PBS; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri), fixed cells were exposed at 4 °C overnight to anti-mouse Bax monoclonal antibody (mAb) (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, U.S.A.) and anti-mouse Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) On the following day samples were washed with PBS and exposed to Alexa Fluor ® 488 (1:400 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hours at room temperature. Immunostaining specificity was verified by omitting one of the steps of the immuno-histochemical procedure, or by replacing the primary antisera with non-immune rabbit serum or PBS.</p>
              <p id="p0100"><italic>Nuclei staining.</italic> Fixed cells were exposed to RNAse (1:500 dilution) for 15 minutes at 37 °C and then stained with propidium iodide (1:1000 dilution, stock solution 1 mg/ml) for 15 minutes at Room Temperature.</p>

During image acquisitions the 488 laser source was set at a 30% energy output and emission ranges were set between 500–550 and 600–700 nm for Alexa 488-conjugated antibodies and for propidium iodide detection, respectively. Single plane images were taken at the centre of cell thickness and pinhole was set to ensure best confocality (AU= 1 airy; m = 114.73 μm). Alternatively, stacks of 50 sections with a Z-step of 122 nm (optical thickness of each section) for a total thickness of 5.9–6 μm were taken for each image. Average projections were calculated using Leica LCS software.</p>

The dissolved cell suspensions were incubated at 37 °C in a shaking bath for 2 hours and then 1 ml of Hoechst 33258 dye, 1 mg/ml in SSC buffer, was added in the dark. Absorbance was measured with an LS5 Perkin Elmer spectrofluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 nm and 460 nm, respectively. Cell proliferation was estimated by referring fluorescence units to a linear standard curve for DNA fluorescence versus cell number. The standard curve was performed by submitting different aliquots of C6 cells, previously counted in a haemocytometer chamber, at the same passage of those submitted to experimental procedures, then processed at the same time and conditions as experimental cultures.</p>

Then the Annexin-V signal showed an exponential increase at 6 and 24h.The PI signal, evidencing the late apoptotic stage, was initially increase over 40% of the signal observed in control, but at 6h the PI signal was strongly reduced almost at level of control. Then, at 24 h the PI signal increase strongly over the 250% compared to signal detected in control.

              <p id="p0225">In the present work microgravity application was used to investigate the effect of gravity alteration vector on cell surviving. The focus on tumor cell line assures to have cells that express surviving pathways as first line of defense in front of an environmental alteration, and not subjected to other pathways favoring cell death as mechanism to protect body organism to which the cells belong.</p>
              <p id="p0230">Our data clearly demonstrate for the first time a transient two-way nuclear/cytoplasmic Bax and Bcl-2 translocation caused by changing gravity vector.</p>
              <p id="p0235">The 3D RPM instrument used for mimic the microgavity act through a continuous rotation, obviously we can't exclude the presence of fluid motions inside the flask. Previous studies demonstrated that adherent cells less than 5% of the cell population is exposed to shear stresses greater than 50 mPa for rotational velocities up to 60 deg/s <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Nevertheless, RPM is an appreciated tool in microgravity-related research and is considered a valuable tool for simulating microgravity [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In fact, using the RPM as microgravity simulator, several cell types showed similar effects as under real microgravity in space <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0240">Applying microgravity to glioma cells induce Bax and Bcl-2 movements between cytoplasm and nucleus. In particular we have detected Bax translocating into nucleus after 1 h, then from there, Bax moves redistributing into nucleus and cytoplasm at 6 h, to return towards a total cytoplasmic localization following 24 h in μg.</p>
              <p id="p0245">Conversely, Bcl-2 remain in its cytoplasmic localization at 1 h in μg, then start to move into nucleus, where we can detected after 6 h of μg exposition. From nucleus Bcl-2 move back into cytoplasm, were we can detect at 24 h of μg exposition.</p>
              <p id="p0250">The analysis performed on AK1, G alpha protein and TIM, rule out any nuclear fraction contamination by elements pertaining to cytoplasm, plasma membrane or mitochondria and exclude eventual physical phenomena, like micropore formation in the nuclear membrane, caused by microgravity treatment that could allow cytoplasmic proteins transfer into the nucleus. Therefore, our data demonstrate that Bax and Bcl- 2 translocation is far from random movements and rather occurs as an independent adaptive mechanism to μg application.</p>
              <p id="p0255">Even if the apoptotic action of Bax and Bcl-2 is classically associated to their action in cytoplasm, on mitochondria integrity, the detected movements of Bax and Bcl-2 have been find associated to cell apoptosis, which morphology has been detected in the generation of blebs on the cellular surface, observed by SEM.</p>
              <p id="p0260">Apoptotic index showed an increase of apoptosis in the cells underput to μg, evidencing the occurrence of a suffering status of cellular system in μg. Moreover, the cell proliferation index, evaluated by DNA assay, in the same treated cells shows a parallel time-dependent reduction. For this reason, the number of apoptotic cells cannot be correlated to an increased number of cells.</p>
              <p id="p0265">However, an intriguing finding emerges from our data consisting in the different profile of the two apoptotic signals marking the so-called early apoptosis and late apoptosis.</p>
              <p id="p0270">During the apoptosis process, the cells initially express on the extracellular membrane signal such as phosphatidylserine (marked by Annexin V) identifying the so-called early apoptosis phase. During the final phase of apoptotic process (late apoptosis) the nuclear membrane integrity is loss together the DNA fragmentation allowing DNA freely available to PI staining.</p>
              <p id="p0275">In our work the early apoptosis signal showed a gradual exponential growth, confirming the occurrence of cell suffering under μg exposition. But the late apoptosis showed a signal drop just at 6 h, corresponding to time in which we have observed Bcl-2 into cell nucleus, otherwise with the exit from cell nucleus after 24 h the late apoptosis signal rapidly increases. Bcl-2 role within the nucleus is not clear, even if a possible action in regulating traffic from the cytosol to the nucleus was proposed <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, whereas Massaad et coll <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. observed an inhibition of transcription factor activity by nuclear compartment-associated Bcl-2. These observations and our findings may indicate a novel non-canonical pathway by which Bcl-2 became a velocity controller of apoptotic process following its translocation into the nucleus.</p>
              <p id="p0280">Our works was focused on the glioma cell line because previous findings seems to indicate that mechanisms of Bax and Bcl2 nuclear translocation were active in tumoral or embryonic cell.</p>
              <p id="p0285">under particular stress conditions [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], potentially identifying it as a mechanism associated to those cells that have not active the anoikis pathways, that is an apoptotic pathway typically expressed in differentiated cells <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0290">In squamous carcinoma PC10 cells subjected to hyperthermia (42 °C) only Bax translocation to the nucleus was observed. The authors hypothesized it to be a mechanism acted out by those cells to escape apoptotic events; in fact this phenomenon was not observed when the same cells were treated with the chemotherapeutic agent Paclitaxel, an anticancer agent, that blocks mitosis and induces apoptosis, interacting with Bcl-2 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In vivo and in vitro neonatal models also showed Bax phosphorylation and its translocation to the nucleus within few hours of hypoxic-ischemic injury in the immature brain, and a decrease of Bcl-2 and its nuclear translocation were demonstrated <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p>
              <p id="p0295">These findings indicate that the Bax/Bcl-2 translocation is a process used by several tumoral cell (not exposed to microgravity) identifying it as a complex pathway by which cells regulate the timing of apoptotic induction. Otherwise the alteration of cell cytoskeleton is a first evidence observed in cells exposed to microgravity [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and several authors have pointed out the link between cytoskeleton integrity and apoptosis [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These findings may address the observed Bax/Bcl-2 translocation to cytoskeleton alteration under microgravity application.</p>
              <p id="p0300">Investigations on the effective relationships between cytoskeleton and Bax/Bcl-2 translocation deserve to be explored by use of opportune cytoskeletal blocking agents.</p>
              <p id="p0305">The evidence obtained in tumoral cells lets open the question about a real physiological role of Bax/Bcl2 nucleus translocation, but on the other hand these findings may reveal a phenomenon of apoptosis escape or slowdown performed by tumoral cells for their save and surviving. The use of other tumoral cell line and not -tumoral cells are needed to verify if these findings represent general pathways adopted by tumoral cells.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="p0310">These dynamic aspects remark the occurrence of an unexpected relationship for Bax and Bcl-2 as actors involved in pathways different from that focusing on apoptotic mitochondrial destruction to which they are classically related.</p>
              <p id="p0315">The data reported in this paper, indeed suggest a possible role of these well-known cytoplasmic protein nuclear functions (transcription, mRNA stability, DNA protein scaffold stability). Future studies could be focused of temporal coordination of different cellular processes (molecular mechanisms, gene targets, macromolecular nucleoprotein complexes) occurring in distinctive cellular compartment to achieve the definitive objective (control of cell proliferation, apoptosis).</p>
              <p id="p0320">In line with other observation we observed Bax and Bcl-2 movement from cytoplasm to nucleus during response to stress that may open hypothesis on potential interaction within the nuclear compartment or introduce a role in the compartmentation or their direct action on nucleus matrix elements to realize a further regulation point along the apoptotic cascade pathway.</p>
              <p id="p0325">Of course, could be very important in order to understand the role of Bcl-2 and Bax during response to stress in particular cell types and therefore trying to understand how they move to and from the nucleus would add new knowledge on their possible, not obvious yet, interactions within the nuclear compartment.</p>
              <p id="p0330">The physiological meaning and, even more, the possible therapeutic applications of this finding could be indeed of great interest not only for researchers interested in μg but also for those working on apoptosis and cancer, because in human breast cancer cells, Bcl-2 and Bax were observed to interact within the nucleus <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p>

              <p id="p0405">Figure reports the WB analyses on isolated nuclei of C6 glioma cells. For each panels, the samples loaded were: lane 1, mitochondria enriched fraction (Mit), used as positive control; lane 2, nuclei from control C6 glioma cells (time 1 hour); lane 3, nuclei from control C6 glioma cells (time 6 hours); lane 4, nuclei from control C6 glioma cells (time 24 hours); lane 5, nuclei from C6 glioma cells treated with μg for 1 hour; lane 6, nuclei from C6 glioma cells treated with μg 6 hours; lane 7, nuclei from C6 glioma cells treated with μg for 24 hours. Panel A reports the whole protein pattern stained with Red Ponceau, full image in Supplementary section (Suppl6. F5a). Panels b and c show the semiquantitative Western Blot analysis of Bax, full image in Supplementary section (Suppl7. F5b) and Bcl-2, full image in Supplementary section (Suppl8. F5c). The ratios of these signals were analyzed by densitometry and normalized against the Red Ponceau signal (Panels d and e, respectively) The values of densitometric analysis are expressed as Relative Optical density (R.O.D.). Each panel is representative of at least five experiments and in Panels d and e data are expressed as mean ± S.D.</p>
