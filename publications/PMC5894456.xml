                <p>This paper deals with vegetable cultivation that could be faced in a space mission. This paper focusses on optimization, light, temperature and the harvesting process, while other factors concerning cultivation in space missions, i.e. gravity, radiation, were not addressed. It describes the work done in preparation of the deployment of a mobile test facility for vegetable production of fresh food at the Neumayer III Antarctic research station. A selection of vegetable crops was grown under varying light and temperature conditions to quantify crop yield response to climate factors that determine resource requirement of the production system. Crops were grown at 21 °C or 25 °C under light treatments varying from 200 to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup>  s<sup>−1</sup> and simulated the dusk and dawn light spectrum. Fresh food biomass was harvested as spread harvesting (lettuce), before and after regrowth (herbs) and at the end of cultivation.</p>
                <p>Lettuce and red mustard responded well to increasing light intensities, by 35–90% with increasing light from 200 to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, while the other crops responded more variably. However, the quality of the leafy greens often deteriorated at higher light intensities. The fruit biomass of both determinate tomato and cucumber increased by 8–15% from 300 to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. With the increase in biomass, the number of tomato fruits also increased, while the number of cucumber fruits decreased, resulting in heavier individual fruits. Increasing the temperature had varied effects on production. While in some cases the production increased, regrowth of herbs often lagged behind in the 25 °C treatment. In terms of fresh food production, the most can be expected from lettuce, cucumber, radish, then tomato, although the 2 fruit vegetables require a considerable amount of crop management. Spread harvesting had a large influence on the amount of harvested biomass per unit area. In particular, yield of the 3 lettuce cultivars and spinach was ca. 400% than single harvesting. Increasing plant density and applying spread harvesting increased fresh food production. This information will be the basis for determining crop growth recipes and management to maximize the amount of fresh food available, in view of the constraints of space and energy requirement of such a production system.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="par0025">Production of food is essential in order to realize successful space missions for extended periods of time. As staple crops can be preserved dried for a long time, a priority is production of fresh vegetables, which has also been shown to have beneficial psychological effects for the crew members (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Koga and Iwasaki, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Odeh and Guy, 2017</xref>). The purpose of the EU-funded EDEN ISS project (Ground Demonstration of Plant Cultivation Technologies and Operation in Space) is to develop a growing system for fresh vegetables, that can operate under the constraints of a space mission. However, plant cultivation during space missions must cope with factors like gravity and radiation, which are difficult to properly address in plant cultivation on earth.</p>
              <p id="par0030">As deep space is still far away, the EDEN ISS project is limited to design and build a mobile test facility (MTF) in which crops can be cultivated for at least one full year, that will be deployed to the Neumayer III Antarctic research station (<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Zabel et al., 2016</xref>). The use of Antarctica as analogue for deep space lies particularly in the hostile external environment, being physically isolated and the limited resources available in terms of crew time, energy and volume. Therefore, it is necessary to define growth conditions and crop management that maximise the productivity of both space and energy, that is electricity to power artificial light and air conditioning. For instance, in order to maximize light use efficiency (LUE) of lettuce, <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Poulet et al. (2014)</xref> made use of targeted lighting, illuminating only the photosynthetic plant tissue. This was achieved by having the plants in fixed spots, which entails a large fraction of unused space during the early stage of the crops. Space is also a very limited resource in space missions, and to mimic this, the cultivation space in the MTF will be 40 racks of 40 × 60 cm, of which 22 are 30 cm high (cultivation space between the top of the rack and lamp), 16 are 80 cm and 2 are 160 cm. The issue is therefore to develop crop growing and management recipes that maximise productivity of both electricity and space. This requires some knowledge of the marginal value (in term of additional production) of both. That was the purpose of the work described here, which was carried out in climate rooms equipped similarly to the growing cabinets of the MTF. The development of these crop growth recipes may also be employed in vertical farming.</p>
              <p id="par0035">The first step is, rather obviously, the selection of suitable crops. While the aspect of human nutrition is obviously an important element in space farming, it has been expressed in earlier studies (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Hoff et al., 1982</xref>, <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the fact that the physical space for plant growth is very limiting in space missions, the focus was placed on the psychological component of a limited amount of fresh food. The desirable characteristics of ready-to-eat fresh vegetable products for their well-being have been expressed by former astronauts and crews that have over-wintered on Antarctica (<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Mauerer et al., 2016</xref>,We developed an objective selection method that differently prioritizes “hard” constraints (for instance, space) and “soft” constraints (such as harvest index or even spiciness) (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Dueck et al., 2016</xref>). The method resulted in a diverse set of vegetable crops, each with their own specific requirements for optimal growth and production, like light intensity, light spectrum, temperature and humidity.</p>
              <p id="par0040">With a knowledge of the edible biomass that can be harvested per unit area per cultivation cycle of the individual crops, it becomes possible to set-up a crop plan (sowing and harvest dates) to maximise space utilisation; food production and diet variety.</p>
              <p id="par0045">Whereas light intensity (and spectrum) can be adapted in each single tray of the growing unit in the MTF, there will be one temperature and humidity set point. Therefore, the overall objectives of this work were:<list list-type="simple" id="lis0010"><list-item id="lsti0025"><label>•</label><p id="par0050">Determine the “marginal” value of resources (light and temperature) in terms of [fresh] yield.</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0030"><label>•</label><p id="par0055">Collect suitable information for crop management planning that maximises productivity of the unit and ensures a varied diet.</p></list-item></list></p>

              <title>Methods</title>
              <p id="par0060">Their limited size and high harvest index, ensure that leafy greens are always at the top of any list for “space vegetables” for fresh food (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Hoff et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Chunxiao and Hong, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2015</xref>). Our list was not an exception, although it did include a dwarf variety of tomato and a cocktail cucumber (as fruit crops) and radish as root crop. Besides different cultivars of lettuce, spinach, red mustard, Swiss chard and herbs were included for more taste and quality aspects. Two experiments were conducted to determine the influence of light intensity, and the influence of temperature at 2 different light levels on the growth of the vegetables and regrowth of some crops, harvested during or at the end of the growth period.</p>

                  <title>Plant material and growth conditions</title>
                  <p id="par0065">Two consecutive trials were conducted to accommodate 9 different crops. Five crops were grown in the first trial: lettuce ‘Expertise’ (type Crispy Green; Rijk Zwaan, de Lier, NL) and ‘Outredgeous’ (type red Romaine; Johnny Seeds, Winslow, ME), red mustard ‘Frizzy lizzy’ and radish ‘Lennox’ (Bayer/HILD, DE), and chives ‘Staro’ (Johnny Seeds, Winslow, ME). In the second trial the following crops were grown: lettuce ‘Othilie’ (type Batavia; Rijk Zwaan, de Lier, NL), rocket ‘Rucola Cultivated’ (Seeds from Italy, Harrow, UK), Swiss chard ‘Red ruby’ (Johnny Seeds, Winslow, ME) and spinach ‘Golden Eye’ (Rijk Zwaan, de Lier, NL). Seeds were sown directly onto 2 cm rock wool plugs and were later transplanted into 7 × 7 cm rock wool blocks, or directly onto smaller rock wool blocks (4 × 4 cm) depending on the estimated final plant size. They were placed in 40 × 60 × 10 cm open trays and were given a nutrient solution with an ebb and flow system. The nutrient solution with an EC 1.7 and pH 5.8 was composed of, in mmol l<sup>−1</sup>: 11.5 NO<sub>3</sub>-, 1.0 SO<sub>4</sub>-, 1.25 P-, 1.0 NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, 6.75 K<sup>+</sup>, 2.63 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 0.25 Cl- and 1.0 Mg<sup>2+</sup>; and in μmol l<sup>−1</sup>: 20 Fe, 25 B, 10 Mn, 5 Zn, 0.75 Cu and 0.5 Mo. The climatic conditions entailed a day/night temperature set points of 21/19 °C, a day/night relative humidity of 75/85%, 750 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> and a 17 h photoperiod. The realised climate was 20.7/18.9 °C day/night; 76/83% RH day/night and 744 ppm CO<sub>2</sub> during the light period.</p>

                  <title>Experimental design</title>
                  <p id="par0070">Each trial took place within a period of 6 weeks in 2 climate chambers, the first in May/June, followed by the second trial in July/August 2016. Artificial light was supplied by LED lighting modules from Heliospectra AB, Götenburg, Sweden, with 4 programmable channels of blue (446 nm), red (663 nm), far red (736 nm) and white LEDs (5700 K) (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). As <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows, the red and blue peak of the lamps correspond with peaks in the relative quantum efficiency of roses (<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Paradiso et al., 2011</xref>) earlier established by <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">McCree (1972)</xref> for multiple crops. A choice was made to use one spectrum that covered photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), with relatively more red light than in sunlight and included far red radiation. A large number of studies have been performed with basic red and blue (RB) LED lighting, but recent research (<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Mazza and Ballaré, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Park &amp; Runkle, 2017</xref>) has indicated that the addition of far red and white or green light enhances plant growth and production in an environment without sunlight. <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al.

                  <p id="par0190">The effect of light intensity on cucumber production differed to that of tomato, in that while 8% more fruit biomass was produced at 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, the number of fruits decreased indicating that the individual fruit weight rose, in this case by more than 22%. The HI for cucumber was much higher at 300 (54%) than at 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (40%) respectively. Here too, production was calculated over the whole cultivation period, while the actual harvesting occurred during the last 74 days prior to termination of the experiment.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="par0195">The aim of the research is to realise maximum food production as efficiently as possible (space and energy are limiting factors) by determining the marginal value of light and temperature in terms of fresh yield, and to collect suitable information for crop management planning that maximises productivity.</p>
              <p id="par0200">Because crops vary in their intrinsic light use efficiency and ability to convert light to edible plant biomass, a number of experiments was performed to investigate the influence of LED lighting on plant growth and production on a number of fresh food vegetables. The effect of increasing the light intensity from 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> up to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> on food production at a given plant density was not large, generally varying from a factor 0.7–1.9 compared to that at 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Therefore, in order to increase the LUE, some crops were planted at a much higher density and were partially harvested at regular intervals (spread harvest), as manipulation of plant spacing is known to increase light interception and its efficient use in any crop (cf. <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulos and Pararajasingham, 1997</xref>). Spread harvesting was begun when plants were at their maximum growth rate in their exponential growth phase and began to touch each other. From then on, 2–3 leaves of the leafy green vegetables were harvested weekly, depending on their growth rate. Calculated per unit area, the amount of fresh food thus produced increased dramatically (a factor between 2 and 4) compared to that in single harvesting. The fresh food production at the South Pole Food Growth Chamber (<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>) was harvested similarly to the single harvesting in this study, but the production was lower. The production realised in this study is a factor 2–6 higher for lettuce, twice as high for cucumber and more than 10 times higher for tomato. Increasing plant density thus increased crop light use efficiency, as more light was absorbed by the crop, which increased the total photosynthesis at crop level (per unit area), and thus the crop production (<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2014</xref>). Another reason for the high production is partial harvesting in time. Even though this spread harvesting is realised at the cost of crew member time (another scarce resource), it should be taken into serious consideration, as the resulting food production is at least twice as high, and working hands-on with the plants may well have a positive influence on crew member’s well-being (<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Koga &amp; Iwasaki, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 1994</xref>). At the end, it boils down to striking the right expenditure balance among the resources labour; seed; space and electricity.</p>
              <p id="par0205">Even though spread harvesting was applied, the influence of increasing the light intensity to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> remained only marginally higher than that for single harvests at 200 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, a factor 0.83–1.89. Accepted horticultural wisdom is that increasing available light should increase biomass (<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Marcelis et al., 2006</xref>). The fact that this did not happen here suggests that other factors (rather than light) may have been limiting productivity.</p>
              <p id="par0210">The aim of course is to maximise the energy efficiency at a given plant distribution and the contribution and balance of (less) light and temperature should be considered. The temperature conditions in the MTF will have to be the same for all crops. Thus, at a given temperature, the amount of light given will have the largest influence on crop growth and production. In searching for a good balance between light and temperature, 4 of the vegetable crops and 2 herbs were grown at a lower (21/19° day/night) and higher (25/23 °C day/night) temperature. In general, a higher fresh weight biomass for red mustard (1.3 times) and rocket (1.1 times) and a lower biomass for radish (0.8 times) was observed at the higher temperature (values averaged 300 and 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), while no difference was observed for lettuce (Tables 7 and 8). The roots of herbs on the other hand, appeared to have suffered from the higher temperature during regrowth. To cultivate all crops in the same unit the regime of 21/19 °C is more productive compared to 25/23 °C. From an energetic point of view it is more profitable to maintain higher temperatures during lighting and lower temperatures during darkness in the MTF in Antarctica because the lamps will provide heat. As crops react on an average temperature (so called ‘temperature integration’, <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">de Koning et al., 1990</xref>), a temperature regime of 23/17° (with an average of 20 °C, like 21/19 °C) will be energetically beneficial.</p>
              <p id="par0215">The production of lettuce was very high at 118 k m<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup> (25 kg m<sup>2</sup> 11 weeks<sup>−1</sup> in the experiment; <xref rid="tbl0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) compared to commercial cultivation without supplemental lighting (35 kg m<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) observed in The Netherlands (<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Anon., 2012</xref>). Doubling the light intensity from 300 to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and thus the amount of energy used for lighting, resulted in ca. 20% less fresh biomass production by lettuce at 21 °C, while it increased the production of the other 3 vegetables by 10–45% (<xref rid="tbl0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, <xref rid="tbl0040" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The overall cost of energy was higher than its benefit, so this might be an argument for cultivation a lower light intensity, saving valuable energy, not only for lighting but for cooling and dehumidification as well, in the MTF (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Graamans et al. 2017</xref>). For lettuce, the quality reduced at 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, which is an important argument to cultivate at a lower light intensity of 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. It is possible to use different light intensities on every single tray in the MTF in order to increase the production of a small selected number of crops. So the positive effect of 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> on the yield of radish and the initial yield of chives can be worthwhile the costs of more electricity of the lamps providing a higher light intensity. Regrowth of chives, initially grown at 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, can also be conducted at a lower light intensity of 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which saves energy.</p>
              <p id="par0220">In a separate cultivation trial, the fruiting vegetables, determinate tomato and cucumber, were grown at the higher temperature regime common conditions for both, under 300 and 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. The first fruits were ripe 9 (tomato) and 6 (cucumber) weeks after sowing, and were harvested for another 8 and 11 weeks resp., after which the experiment was terminated. The influence of doubling the light intensity on production was 15% and 8% resp., so for these fruiting vegetables, the added value of doubling the light energy input for total production and the harvest index is questionable.</p>
              <p id="par0225">In these trials, cucumber was harvested twice weekly, resulting in heavier fruits and a larger sink strength. This may well have resulted in increasing fruit abortion. Daily harvesting will thus likely reduce flower abortion and increase the number of fruits.</p>
              <p id="par0230">With the data generated from this study and the available shelf space in the MTF, some cautious estimates can be made of the amount of fresh food that can be produced. A part of the 9.6 m<sup>2</sup> cultivation area, approximately 40%, will likely be taken up by crops in their juvenile or vegetative stage. That would allow for ca. 6 m<sup>2</sup> available as production area. The results shown in this study indicate that, given the conditions and crop management used, 4 kg m<sup>−2</sup> of lettuce can be harvested weekly (21 °C, 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, spread harvest), 1.4 kg m<sup>−2</sup> radish (21 °C, 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), 1.3 kg m<sup>−2</sup> of tomato, 2.2 kg m<sup>−2</sup> of cucumber (25 °C, 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), with the other leafy greens yielding 1.2 kg m<sup>−2</sup> (21 °C, 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and herbs 150 g m<sup>−2</sup> week<sup>−1</sup> (21 °C, 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and 1 kg m<sup>−2</sup> week<sup>−1</sup> including regrowth.</p>
              <p id="par0235">With these data it will be possible for crew members to plan their fresh food production, starting with a sowing scheme, in order to realise a more or less constant and varied flow of fresh food. Each crop has its own germination time, days to first harvest and days to final harvest. With these data available, the fresh food diet for a longer period of time can be established and put into practice.</p>

              <title>Conclusions</title>
              <p id="par0240">Crop growing and management recipes were developed to maximise productivity of energy and space. Different light, temperature and cultivation (spread harvest) regimes were tested and edible yield was determined. To choose one temperature regime for the whole MTF, the performance of all crops – in terms of yield and quality - should be taken in consideration. Higher temperatures of 25/23 °C increased production of some crops, but regrowth of herbs lagged behind. All crops performed well at a regime of 21/19 °C and at a light intensity of 300 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, with a few like radish, red mustard and chives and to a lesser extent, lettuce and red mustard, growing more rapidly at light intensities up to 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. However, the quality of lettuce at 600 μmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> deteriorated. Light intensity can be chosen per each single tray and makes the cultivation in the MTF flexible per crop and cultivation cycle.</p>
              <p id="par0245">Increasing the plant density increases the light use efficiency and applying spread harvesting increases fresh food production. Increasing plant density is only possible in combination with spread harvesting, and this combination results is a higher biomass production, but at the cost of extra work by crew members and the availability of seeds. The crew’s desire for the maximum amount of fresh food, given the additional effort (work), will likely reflect its importance (psychological effect) on the crew.</p>
