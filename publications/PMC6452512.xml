                  <title>Background</title>
                  <p id="Par1">The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.</p>

                <sec>
                  <title>Results</title>
                  <p id="Par2">The cultivable bacterial and fungal population ranged from 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/m<sup>2</sup> depending on location and consisted of various bacterial (<italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>) and fungal (<italic>Ascomycota</italic> and <italic>Basidiomycota</italic>) phyla. Amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture-based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. Changes in bacterial and fungal load (by culture and qPCR) were observed over time but not across locations. Bacterial community composition changed over time, but not across locations, while fungal community remained the same between samplings and locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment, suggesting that the analyzed DNA was extracted from intact/viable organisms. Moreover, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured.</p>

                  <title>Conclusions</title>
                  <p id="Par3">The results reveal a diverse population of bacteria and fungi on ISS environmental surfaces that changed over time but remained similar between locations. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens. This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact/viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems and can be used to help develop safety measures that meet NASA requirements for deep space human habitation. The results of this study can have significant impact on our understanding of other confined built environments on the Earth such as clean rooms used in the pharmaceutical and medical industries.</p>

              <title>Introduction</title>
              <p id="Par4">The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest human space platform in low Earth orbit (~ 400 km above Earth’s surface) and for the last 17 years it has been continuously inhabited by an international community of astronauts performing space research. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, subjected to microgravity, radiation, elevated carbon dioxide, and the recirculation of air through HEPA filters and is considered an “extreme environment” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Microbes are known to survive and even thrive in extreme environments, and the microbes that are present on the ISS may have existed since the inception of the ISS while others may be introduced each time new astronauts or payloads arrive.</p>
              <p id="Par5">Since the beginning of the ISS, routine microbial monitoring of surfaces, air, and water has occurred using culture-based techniques as per the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) operations and maintenance requirement procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, culture-based analysis limits our understanding of the diversity of microbes that grow and thrive on the ISS because only a small fraction of organisms in a given environment can be cultured under standard laboratory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Molecular methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and targeted amplicon sequencing, which can identify and quantify both culturable and unculturable organisms provide a more thorough assessment of what is actually present and in what amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, while it has been recently shown as a proof of concept that PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and amplicon sequencing can be performed on the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], microbial monitoring of the ISS with molecular-based methods is not routinely used because of the lack of simple, compact, and reliable sample processing instruments onboard the ISS. Once such devices are available, rapid, real-time microbial detection, functional analysis are possible for the long duration missions, but baseline information about the ISS environmental microbiome is still needed.</p>
              <p id="Par6">The importance of cataloging the ISS microbiome, which consists of both culturable and unculturable microbes, parallels the surge in research into the “built microbiome” here on Earth. Emerging studies on the microbiome of homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], offices, classrooms, museums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have revealed an assemblage of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa unique to that indoor environment that are influenced by a variety of factors such as building design, ventilation, humidity, air pressure and flow, occupant numbers, or activities performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Specific microbes in these indoor spaces have been shown to impact human health by influencing our susceptibility to allergies, infectious diseases, or sick building syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The influence of the indoor microbiome on human health becomes more important for astronauts during flights due to altered immunity associated with space flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the lack of sophisticated medical interventions that are available on Earth.</p>
              <p id="Par7">In light of an upcoming new era of human expansion in the universe, such as future space travel to Mars, the microbiome of the closed space environment needs to be examined thoroughly to identify the types of microorganisms that can accumulate in this unique environment, how long they persist and survive, and their impact on human health and spacecraft infrastructure. For this reason, the National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey recommended that NASA establish a coordinated, large-scale Microbial Observatory program within the ISS platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As part of this NASA initiative, the microbial communities on ISS surfaces from eight defined locations over three flight missions, spanning 14 months, were characterized using culture-based techniques, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Before DNA extraction, half of the sample was treated with propidium monoazide (PMA) so that the microbiome of intact/viable cells (PMA treatment) could be characterized. The PMA-untreated samples yielded information about the total microbial population (including free DNA, dead cells, cells with a compromised cell membrane, intact cells, and viable cells). PMA binds to DNA, making the DNA unavailable for amplification during PCR steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Due to its higher molecular weight and/or charge, PMA cannot penetrate into cells that have an intact cell membrane (i.e., viable) but can bind to free floating DNA or DNA inside cells with a compromised cell membrane (i.e., dead cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is in this way that many studies have utilized PMA to distinguish between intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par8">This comprehensive analysis of the ISS microbiome was used to assess how microbial communities change over time (temporal distribution) and throughout the ISS (spatial distribution). In addition, the ISS environmental microbiome data were compared with other Earth built environmental microbiome data such as the Earth Microbiome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], Hospital ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Qiita study 10,172), and Office microbiome ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], Qiita study 10,423). The implementation of novel molecular techniques to monitor intact microbial populations in this unique environment opens a possibility for broadening the current surveillance practices to maintain the health of the crew and to promote advances in deep space human habitation in the future.</p>

There were no statistically significant differences in the average bacterial load across the eight locations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b); however, the locations that exceeded 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/m<sup>2</sup> during at least one flight sampling event were L1 (port panel next to cupola), L5 (overhead 4), L7 (lab 3 overhead), and L8 (crew quarters), with the lowest counts (less than 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/m<sup>2</sup> in at least one sampling event) found at L3 (AREM) and L6 (PMM). Overall, the number of bacteria (combination of R2A and BA growth) isolated from the ISS from all 24 samples ranged from 6.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 7.8 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/m<sup>2</sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Cultivable bacterial and fungal burden from eight locations on the ISS over a 14-month period. <bold>a</bold> Scatter plot representing the CFU/m<sup>2</sup> of bacteria and fungi at each location across three flight sampling events.

While, there were no statistically significant differences in fungal load over time, the highest average was found during F1 and the lowest at F2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Similar to what was observed with bacterial counts, no differences in fungal counts were evident across the eight locations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). When compared to bacteria, the fungal population was lower by 2 to 3 logs at all locations except at L6 where fungal load was 100-fold more than bacterial load (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).

              <p id="Par12">Of the total bacterial and fungal isolates that grew, 133 bacterial isolates and 81 fungal isolates were identified by Sanger sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria; and ITS region for fungi).

              <p id="Par14">The 16S rRNA gene and the ITS region were targeted in PMA-qPCR to measure intact/viable bacterial and fungal burden, respectively. The changes were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05), although the average number of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies trended toward increase from F1 to F3. On the other hand, the ITS region amplicons decreased over time with F3 being statistically significantly lower than F1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). While the average bacterial (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and fungal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c) load fluctuated across locations, there were no statistically significant differences in microbial load among different locations. Overall, bacterial loads appeared to be highest at L4 and L5 and lowest at L6, with fungal loads appearing to be highest at L1, L4, L5, and L7 and lowest at L2. The average number of bacteria present on the ISS during this study was 3.1 × 10<sup>9</sup> 16S rRNA gene copy number/m<sup>2</sup> and 7.1 × 10<sup>8</sup> ITS copy number/m<sup>2</sup> for fungi. A comparison between CFU and gene copy number revealed that on average, 46% of total intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured, while the remainder were viable but yet to be cultured (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1C).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Intact cell membrane/viable bacterial and fungal population aboard the ISS as estimated by PMA-qPCR. <bold>a</bold> Scatter plot comparing the 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and ITS region (fungi) copy numbers of PMA treated samples collected during flights 1, 2, and 3.

              <p id="Par15">qPCR was also performed on samples that were not treated with PMA to assess the overall microbial load, which includes intact/viable cells and compromised/dead cells.

When the 16S rRNA gene copies were summed up for all locations and all flights, no significant difference was observed with and without PMA (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1D). This calculation may be affected by the artificial inflation of high copy numbers in samples treated with and without PMA. For example, the highest copy numbers of a sample with 10<sup>10</sup> copies per m<sup>2</sup> (for example, Flight 1, Location #2) might mask the samples with 10<sup>7</sup> copies per m<sup>2</sup> (for example Flight 1, Location #6). The difference in microbial populations between PMA and non-PMA-treated samples were substantial when the data from individual locations were considered. In general, ~ 0.68% (example: Flight 2; Location #3) to ~ 92.8% (example: Flight 3; Location #5) of the microbial load was present in the PMA-treated sample and therefore considered “viable” (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1E).

              <p id="Par25">Publicly available sequences of PMA-treated samples collected from two JPL clean rooms, ISS dust, ISS HEPA filters, and surface samples from an inflated Lunar Mars analogue habitat (ILMAH) were compared. As is clear from the PCoA plot shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9, the ISS surface microbiome is a unique microbiome, differing from the ISS-dust, ISS-HEPA, JPL clean rooms, and Lunar/Mars-like human-occupied habitats. In addition, PMA-untreated microbial diversity associated with ISS environments was compared to results obtained from the Earth Microbiome Project, hospital environment, and office spaces. The ISS samples grouped with the built environment data, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. This relationship also suggests that, as expected, the environmental locations sampled on the ISS harbored microbes more similar to those on animal surfaces (e.g., skin) than to environmental soil samples. Similar pattern was seen with built environmental samples from Earth. Thus, the ISS samples resembled other Earth built environment samples, and the differences among flights (including differences in DNA extraction and PCR amplification) were relatively small compared to the differences among different sample types.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of ISS environmental microbiome with microbiomes of Earth.

There were four sOTUs that appear to be unique relative to all the built environment datasets analyzed (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S4), although they accounted for a very small total amount of the sequence mass (~ 0.0005% of the reads).

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p id="Par27">The ISS environmental microbiome was characterized from eight locations throughout the ISS during three flight sampling events over a period of 14 months. This allowed the examination of temporal and spatial distribution of microbial populations on the ISS. This is the first study to utilize culture, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing to study the surfaces of the US segment and revealed a diverse intact/viable population of bacteria and fungi that changed over time but were similar across locations.</p>
              <p id="Par28">Several studies have been carried out to measure microbiological cleanliness of the ISS environment using cultivation-based approaches since the inception of this closed system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Recently, several ISS surfaces in the US nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and Japanese Kibo module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were swabbed and targeted amplicon sequencing carried out. However, these studies did not measure the intact/viable microbiome which therefore could not be compared to culture counts nor provide an assessment for crew risk. Previous reports on the ISS intact/viable microbiomes on the ISS were only examined from air filters and debris collected via vacuum cleaner bag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The ISS is a unique environment and one question that is of interest to many is how this intact/viable microbiome compares to other closed, regulated environments (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S9 and Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The ISS environmental microbiome resembles that of animal skin surfaces rather more than the soil microbiome. This might be due to the fact that cargo sent to the space station was cleaned thoroughly, and hence soil-associated microorganisms were not present.</p>
              <p id="Par29">The predominant organisms on ISS surfaces consisted of those that are associated with humans, with some considered opportunistic pathogens on Earth. As to whether they could cause disease in astronauts on the ISS is unknown, as it would depend on the health status of each individual and how these organisms function while in the space environment. Regardless, the detection of possible disease-causing organisms highlights the importance of further genomic and transcriptomic studies to examine how these ISS microbes function in space and how they may impact astronauts’ health. Correlating viable but opportunistic pathogens with crew member health is likely to raise too many questions about access to the crew microbiome data which is not yet publicly available, and about statistical power: because the ISS has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. From the time the ISS was built in 1998, as of Aug 3, 2017, 222 astronauts visited the ISS, and microbial signatures left behind by previous astronauts might interfere with the predictions. Consequently, the present ISS environmental microbial metrics could not be linked to any particular crew member. Since there were no differences in community composition and richness between PMA- and non-PMA treated samples, it suggests that the DNA analyzed from these possible opportunistic pathogens residing on the ISS environmental surfaces are indeed intact/viable and not dead organisms.</p>
              <p id="Par30">Noteworthy, approximately 46% of intact/viable bacteria and 40% of intact/viable fungi could be cultured with the culture media used during this study. This percentage is high when compared to spacecraft assembly cleanrooms on Earth where only 1 to 10% of intact/viable microorganisms can be cultured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The possible explanation is that the ISS is not deprived of nutrients like spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and while this is a hermetically sealed environment, it is exposed to microbes from astronauts (maximum six astronauts at a given time) and cargo (delivered ~ 4–6 times per year). Furthermore, no relationship was found between microbial load and sample processing time (F1: 7 days, F2: 9 days, and F3: 6 days).</p>
              <p id="Par31">Many of the organisms detected on the ISS are known to form biofilms that belong to both bacterial (<italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, and <italic>Klebsiella</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and fungal (<italic>Penicillium</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Rhodotorula</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] genera. This could pose problems for astronauts if they do become infected as biofilms are known to promote resistance to antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Also, biofilm formation on the ISS could decrease infrastructure stability by causing mechanical blockages, reducing heat transfer efficiency, and inducing microbial influenced corrosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Some of the microorganisms that were identified on the ISS that have been implicated in microbial-induced corrosion on Earth are <italic>Methylobacterium</italic>, <italic>Sphingomonas</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Penicillium</italic>, and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]; however, the role they play in corrosion aboard the ISS remains to be determined. Elucidating the potential ability to form biofilms and the magnitude of actual biofilm formation on ISS surfaces is important during long-term space missions to maintain structural stability of the crew vehicle when routine indoor maintenance cannot be as easily performed.</p>
              <p id="Par32">As expected, culture-based analysis did not detect as many genera as that with amplicon sequencing; however, its importance should not be overlooked as species level identity of ISS microbial constituents could be obtained when isolates were available. Furthermore, isolating organisms allowed us to conduct a separate study to examine the influence of microgravity and radiation on antibiotic resistance and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and to obtain whole genome sequences of organisms that grow in space, for future comparative genomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similar to a previous study on ISS HEPA filters, where the novel organism, <italic>Solibacllus kalamii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]was able to be identified only through culture analysis, this study has also allowed us to detect a recently identified novel species <italic>Enterobacter bugandensis</italic> that was associated with human disease on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]<italic>.</italic> A high percentage of the cultivable population represented opportunistic pathogens such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</italic>, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>conspicua</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter pittii</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic>. This could have potential health impacts on astronauts, as bacteria and fungi have been shown to be transferred between surfaces and humans upon contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The scope of the present study was not to determine whether these microorganisms were more virulent or resistant to antibiotics than on Earth but the whole genome sequences have been published for the isolated biosafety level 2 microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and comparative genomics of these ISS isolates with Earth strains is now possible for further investigation.</p>
              <p id="Par33">Members of the family <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> were the most predominant organisms on ISS surfaces of the US module, similar to what has been published for the Japanese module of the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and were detected in almost every sample by both culture and amplicon sequencing (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S10). Both are human-associated organisms, with <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic> commonly found on the skin and in the nasal passage, and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract. These two taxa are also abundant in fitness centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], office buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], suggesting that the ISS is similar to other built environments on Earth, in that its microbiome is shaped by human occupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On Earth, it has been observed that incoming intensive care unit (ICU) patients have a significantly higher risk of acquiring infections if the previous occupant was a carrier, despite terminal cleaning of the bed and the room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Thus, habitation of the same area, regardless of whether individuals interact or not, may contribute to disease spread. Further studies assessing how long organisms survive on ISS surfaces and how readily they can be passed on from one individual to another in space can lead to the development of countermeasures to minimize the spread of infections from one astronaut to another during simultaneous or even separate flight missions.</p>
              <p id="Par34"><italic>Methylobacteriaceae</italic>/<italic>Methylobacterium</italic> was also dominant across the ISS and could be cultured from several samples. This is a hardy organism that can withstand harsh conditions, such as ionizing radiation and strong cleaning detergents and has previously been found in NASA spacecraft assembly clean rooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], hospital ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], and the MARS500 habitat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. <italic>Moraxallaceae</italic>, another abundant organism on the ISS, also thrives in harsh conditions, being present in higher relative abundances in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], areas of the home that utilize a lot of chemicals (i.e., washing machine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and deep sea sediment of inactive hydrothermal vents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par35"><italic>R</italic>. <italic>mucilaginosa</italic> was the predominant fungal isolate from the culture analysis, and belongs to the <italic>Sporidiobolaceae</italic> family which was found in high relative abundances across the ISS with amplicon sequencing. This organism can survive inside dishwashers despite high temperatures and chemical exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par36">Numerous studies conducted on Earth have shown that the type and amount of human activity in a particular location impacts that indoor microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and while there were no differences in the average microbial load (by culture and qPCR) nor community structure (amplicon sequencing), it was clear that there were variations between sampling points across different locations. Among the eight locations sampled (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), location #6 (permanent multipurpose module [PMM] port 1) exhibited low concentrations of cultivable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), viable (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a), and total (data not shown) microbial burden. The PMM is a specific location within the Node 1 Nadir module of ISS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to store bags intact as opposed to open and place them into racks. Minimum crew activities are expected in PMM location #6 and hence microbial abundance might be minimal compared to other locations that are heavily occupied by astronauts in a day to day activities such as observing window cupola (location #1), toilet (location #2), ARED exercise platform (location #3), dining table (location #4) performing several experiments, or sleeping quarters (location #8). In a study performed by Mayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] in an inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat, the cultivable bacterial load was in the range of 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> per m<sup>2</sup> after the student crew inhabited the analog station. There were no significant changes in microbial load between the more active areas like the laboratory and other locations, while bedroom cultivable bacterial load increased toward the end of 30-day occupation. The fungal cultivable population was lower than bacterial, but it was in the range from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> per m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In contrast, the ISS results showed that cultivable microbial load were not uniform between locations and warrant more study.</p>
              <p id="Par37">In general, temporal differences were observed within the bacterial population: F2 samples had higher microbial diversity (alpha diversity) than F1 and F3 samples; only <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> were cultured from F3 samples and nine out of the ten most relatively abundant family level taxa differed over the three flights. These temporal differences may be due to the different occupants onboard the ISS during each of the flight sampling session. Earth indoor microbiome studies have shown that humans shed microbes to indoor surfaces upon contact, playing a pivotal role in shaping the indoor microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Similarly, a study of the inflatable Lunar/Mars analog conducted here on Earth showed differences in bacterial communities between day 0 (before human occupation) and after 30 days of habitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] showing the effects of human occupation on indoor microbial communities in a space-like environment. Of the nine astronauts that were present aboard the ISS from F1 to F2 (2 months apart), only three were present during both flights and none of the astronauts present during F1 or F2 were on the ISS during F3 sampling. Further studies that collect microbial information from astronauts in parallel with air and surface samples would help elucidate how much of an impact astronaut have toward the ISS microbiome. Unlike bacteria, fungal communities were stable over time with no temporal differences, and this could be due to the fact that fungal and bacterial communities follow different environmental determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p>
              <p id="Par38">It should be noted that F3 samples were sequenced separately from the F1/F2 samples and used different but similar V4 primers (see “<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>” section for more details). Due to the SpaceX-7 launch failure and the uncertainty of when F3 sampling kits would be flown to the ISS for sampling, it was not possible to sequence F3 with F1/F2. However, the samples were collected in the same manner, processed identically, and the same protocol used for DNA extraction. We do not believe that the choice of primers, nor the separate sequencing runs, have influenced the differences in temporal distribution presented in this manuscript for the following reasons: (i) Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Table S2 shows the organisms that were statistically significantly different over time and shows the efficiency of each primer pair in detecting these organisms, which are almost identical. (ii) A metagenomics analysis was performed using the same DNA samples as for amplicon sequencing and all three flights were sequenced simultaneously and without multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. The family level barplot for this metagenomics data in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S11 shows the same pattern distribution of taxa, as presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3 for the amplicon sequencing. (iii) Lastly, all statistical analyses were performed with ALDEx2 which estimates per-feature technical variation within each sample using Monte-Carlo instances drawn from Dirichlet distributions. ALDEx2 uses the centered log-ratio transformation that ensures that data are scale invariant and sub-compositionally coherent meaning that all samples are numerical consistent with each other, regardless of the total sequencing read capacity at the time of sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. This ensures that the statistical results are robust and are not influenced solely by the differential detection of ASVs that can occur during different sequencing runs.</p>
              <p id="Par39">Many 16S rRNA and ITS sequences could not be identified via amplicon-targeted analyses, but a metagenomics approach recently conducted identified 318 bacterial and fungal species in these samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, shotgun metagenome analysis carried out by Singh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] from the same samples revealed that reads associated with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid derivatives and cofactors, vitamins, etc. were the highest among all three flights. Similarly, computational analyses showed that the <italic>Legionella</italic> resistome, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance, and multi-drug resistant resistance efflux pump were high on all flights and all locations. The shot-gun reads associated with antimicrobial resistant genes in Flight 3 increased by twofold when compared with Flights 1 and 2 which also predicted the persistence of opportunistic pathogens in Flight 3 samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Collective beta-Lactam resistance derived from the metagenome sequence analysis shows that physical (<italic>OmpF</italic>, <italic>OmpC</italic>), transformational (penicillin-binding protein), and degradational (<italic>AmpC</italic>), and MDR efflux pump (OMP, RND, MPF) mechanisms were allocated by the microorganisms on the ISS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p>

                <p id="Par41">Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA). Briefly, each polyester wipe (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by the transfer to a sterile zip lock bag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Each sampling kit was sent to the ISS onboard the SpaceX-5, -6, -8, rockets and returned to the Earth onboard the Russian vehicle (Soyuz TM-14) and Dragon capsule (SpX-6 or -8). Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the polyester wipes described above (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for a summary of the sampling locations). The metadata associated with the samples and collections is summarized in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: Table S3.</p>
                <p id="Par42">The study requirements stated that there should be no cleaning at least 4 days prior to sampling. When the cleaning occurred during the weekends, it was done at the crew’s discretion without suggestions about the specific locations, therefore following the typical routine of activities on the ISS. The disinfectant wipes that are used in the ISS contain octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.0399%), dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (0.01995%), alkyl (50% C14, 40% C12, 10% C16) dimethylbenzylammonium chloride, and dimethylbenzylammonium chloride (0.0532%). During each flight, one astronaut performed all the sampling and used the wipes to sample one square meter. A new pair of individually packed sterile gloves (KIMTEC Pure G3 White; Nitrile Clean-room Certified; Cat. HC61190) were used before sampling the next location. The crew was instructed to collect samples from the same surfaces during all three sampling sessions. A control wipe (environmental control) was taken out from the Zip lock bag, unfolded, waved for 30 s, and packed back inside a new sterile zip lock. One control wipe was included for each flight session. Similarly, an unused wipe that was flown to the ISS and brought back to Earth along with the samples served as a negative control for sterility testing. If field controls (wipes that were exposed to the ISS environment but not used in active sampling) showed any signs of microbial growth, then negative controls would be assayed for cultivable counts to check sterility of the wipes used for sampling. However, none of the field controls showed any CFUs for all three flights. The samples were stored at room temperature in orbit. After sample collection, samples were returned to Earth after 7 days for Flight 1, 9 days for Flight 2, and 6 days for Flight 3.

                <p id="Par43">Sample processing took place in a ISO 7 (10K class) cleanroom at JPL. In a certified biosafety cabinet, each wipe was aseptically removed from the zip lock bag and transferred to a 500 mL bottle containing 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). The bottle with the wipe was shaken for 2 min followed by concentration with a Concentrating Pipette (Innova Prep, Drexel, MO) using a 0.22 μm Hollow Fiber Polysulfone tips (Cat #: CC08022). Each sample was concentrated to 4 mL with PBS elution fluid (Cat #). Then, 3 mL of this concentrated sample was split into two 1.5 mL aliquots. One aliquot was treated with PMA (18.25 μL of 2 mM PMA, resulting in a final concentration of 25 μM) to assess cells that were viable or had an intact cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], while the second aliquot was handled in a similar manner but without the addition of PMA. The PMA and non-PMA-treated aliquots were incubated in the dark at RT for 5 min, followed by 15 min of photoactivation using the PMA-Lite™ LED Photolysis Device, specifically designed for photoactivation of PMA (Biotium, Hayward, CA). The PMA- and non-PMA -treated aliquots were then split into two 0.75 mL aliquots. One aliquot was transferred to bead beating tubes containing Lysing Matrix E (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA), followed by bead beating for 60 s using the vortex sample holder (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA). The bead-beaten aliquot and the aliquot without bead beating were combined for their corresponding PMA-treated and non-treated samples. DNA extraction was performed with the Maxwell 16 automated system (Promega, Madison, WI), in accordance with manufacture instructions using the Maxwell 16 Tissue LEV Total RNA purification kit. A Maxwell control (MC) without any sample added in its cartridge was run concurrently with each flight sample. The extracted DNA was eluted in 50 μL of water and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis.</p>

                <p id="Par44">The concentrated samples were diluted in PBS (up to 10<sup>−6</sup> of each original sample) and 100 μL of each dilution was plated (in duplicate) on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A for environmental bacteria), Potato Dextrose Agar with chloramphenicol (100 μg/mL; PDA for fungi), and blood agar (BA for human commensals; Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). R2A and PDA plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7 days and BA plates at 35 °C for 2 days at which time colony forming units (CFU) were calculated. Whenever possible, a minimum of five isolates of distinct morphologies were picked from each plate, from each ISS sampling location. The isolates were then archived in semisolid R2A or PDA slants (agar media diluted 1:10) and stored at room temperature. Once a culture was confirmed to be pure, two cryobead stocks (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) were prepared for each isolate and stored at − 80 °C. A loopful of purified microbial culture was directly subjected to PCR and the targeted fragment was amplified (colony PCR), or DNA was extracted with the UltraClean DNA kit (MO Bio, Carlsbad, CA) or Maxwell Automated System (Promega, Madison, WI). The extracted DNA was used for PCR to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene in order to identify bacterial strains. The following primers were used for the 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 55 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The ITS region was amplified using the forward primer ITS1F (5′-TTG GTC ATT TAG AGG AAG TAA-3′) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and reverse primer Tw13 (5′-GGT CCG TGT TTC AAG ACG-3′) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] to obtain a ~ 1.2 kb product. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplicons were inspected on a 1% agarose gel. When bands for products were visible, amplification products were treated with Antarctic phosphatase and exonuclease (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to remove 5′- and 3′-phosphates from unused dNTPs before sequencing.

There was a field control “CTL,” which was a wipe that was opened to the ISS environment but was not used for active sampling and a Maxwell “DNACTL,” which was water that was used during the DNA extraction steps instead of surface or control wipe samples and acted as a DNA extraction reagent control. The field controls were either treated with PMA (“CTL_P”) or left untreated (“CTL”). In total, there were ten controls analyzed during bacterial qPCR and Illumina amplicon sequencing. Likewise, for fungal analysis, the same controls were collected; however, no amplicons were generated for “DNACTL” for either flight nor CTL_P for Flight 1 during qPCR or Illumina library prep and thus were not sent for amplicon sequencing. Similarly, for qPCR and Illumina sequencing, required reagent controls were tested. The samples during this study were designated with flight session number followed by location number (sampling sites). For example, sample number “F1_3” denotes that surface materials were taken from the first flight at location 3 but sample was not treated with PMA, whereas “F1_3P” denotes that same sample was treated with PMA.</p>

              <p>CU wrote the manuscript, generated all figures in the manuscript, processed the raw 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data and analyzed the 16S rRNA gene (bacteria) and ITS region (fungi) amplicon sequencing data, and performed all statistical analyses. ACS was involved in study design, helped interpret and write the manuscript, processed the samples, and performed culture and qPCR analysis. GMM helped process samples and performed culture and qPCR analysis and generated Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1 and S10. VS and QT prepared amplicon sequencing libraries and performed sequencing on F1 and F2 samples for bacteriome and mycobione analysis as well as processing the raw ITS region amplicon sequences. JW generated the CCA plot. TM helped in F1/F2 analyses during the early stages of the study. JM prepared amplicon sequencing libraries and performed sequencing for F3. DM performed a comparative analysis of the ISS surface and Earth microbiomes. GF and RK were involved in experimental design and provided feedback during the write up of the manuscript. FK was instrumental in science payload, metadata generation, and coordinated with astronauts in training of sample collection and return of samples back to Earth. KV was involved in early organization, study design and planning of the research project, and providing direct feedback to all authors throughout the project and during write-up of the manuscript.
