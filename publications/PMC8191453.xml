                <p id="P3">Many factors contribute to the health risks encountered by astronauts on missions outside Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Spaceflight-induced potential adverse neurovascular damage and late neurodegeneration are a chief concern. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on oxidative damage in the mouse brain and its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for 35 days as part of Space-X 12 mission. Ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. Within 38 Â± 4 hours after returning from the ISS, mice were euthanized and brain tissues were collected for analysis. Quantitative assessment of brain tissue demonstrated that spaceflight caused an up to 2.2-fold increase in apoptosis in the hippocampus compared to the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse brain revealed an increased expression of aquaporin4 (AQP4) in the flight hippocampus compared to the controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BBB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). These results indicate a disturbance of BBB integrity. Quantitative proteomic analysis showed significant alterations in pathways responsible for neurovascular integrity, mitochondrial function, neuronal structure, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism in the brain after spaceflight. Changes in pathways associated with adhesion and molecular remodeling were also documented. These data indicate that long-term spaceflight may have pathological and functional consequences associated with neurovascular damage and late neurodegeneration.</p>

              <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
              <p id="P4">The spaceflight environment, characterized mainly by ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors, presents a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a major concern. To the best of our knowledge, little is known about how environmental stressors impact vascular function and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Of the various central nervous system (CNS) barriers, the BBB exerts the greatest control over the immediate microenvironment of cells in the brain. The BBB is present in all brain regions except at circumventricular organs.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> At these sites, blood-borne mediators can traverse the vessel wall through reduced integrity of the tight junctions (TJs) to regulate certain autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. In BBB dysfunction, typically immunological privileged sites are subjected to neuroinflammation, disruptions in the ionic microenvironment and fluid volumes, and dysregulation of neurotransmitters and neuroactive agents.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â€“<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Brain vascular endothelial cells and astrocytes mediate many of these interactions and play a critical role in regulating the BBB.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P5">Preliminary ground-based studies have shown that simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation-induced chronic endothelial dysfunction and BBB disturbance, leading to maladaptive tissue remodeling.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Increasingly, evidence suggests that both actual microgravity, as encountered by astronauts in space, and simulated microgravity on Earth have been shown to induce many deleterious physiological effects including changes in brain structure and function.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Exposure to microgravity leads to a headward shift in body fluids and alterations in cerebral fluid pressures and perfusion.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Indeed, long-duration spaceflight has been shown to alter the brain structure and fluid distribution within the brain of astronauts.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Consequently, changes in cell-cell and cell-vascular interactions could constitute a pathological mechanism(s) responsible for brain injury and neurodegeneration.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P6">The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight on oxidative stress and BBB integrity in the mouse cortex and hippocampus using immunohistochemistry (IHC), and to identify the spaceflight-induced changes in protein expression profiles in mouse brain using proteomic analysis. We hypothesized that spaceflight would induce endothelial/vascular damage, remodeling of TJ proteins, and adhesion molecules from self-perpetuating oxidative stress in the brain. These changes may contribute to BBB disturbance, ultimately, resulting in neurological deficit and neurodegeneration.</p>

                <p id="P7">SpaceX-12 was launched in 2017 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 35-day mission. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc Bar Harbor, ME) at the time of launch, were flown for NASAâ€™s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9) and lived in NASAâ€™s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard the International Space Station (ISS). All flight (FLT) mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26â€“28Â°C with a 12-hour light/dark cycle during the flight. Habitat ground control (GC) mice (n = 20) were kept under similar housing conditions, including temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels using 48-hour delayed telemetry data from the FLT group. Water and food bar diet specifically designed by NASA were provided ad libitum to FLT and GC groups. All mice received the same access to food and water. There were no significant changes in body weight before and after the mission for FLT and GC groups.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> NASA-Ames Research Center and KSC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees approved this flight study. The study has been done in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health (NIH).</p>

                <p id="P8">Within 38 Â± 4 hours of splashdown, the FLT mice were rapidly euthanized in 100% CO<sub>2.</sub> The GC mice were euthanized with the same method after 38 days of GC housing. Shortly after euthanasia, brains were removed and bisected along the midline. The right hemi-brains were placed individually in sterile cryovials, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80Â°C prior to use. The left hemi-brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours and then, rinsed with PBS, infiltrated overnight with 30% sucrose in PBS at 4Â°C, and then, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and frozen at -80Â°C for IHC and apoptosis assays. Brains were then sectioned coronally at a thickness of 20 Î¼m unless otherwise indicated. Five systematically selected sections from each brain sample were used for each biomarker staining.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>

              <p id="P27">Spaceflight-induced changes in measures revealing increased oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and disruption in BBB integrity in the mouse brain. The data demonstrated that spaceflight-induced apoptosis in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), and evoked changes in the expression of BBB-related proteins: AQP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), and PECAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), which all play important roles in BBB integrity and function. These protein changes suggest BBB disruption could happen during and/or following 35 days of spaceflight. We also identified spaceflight-induced changes in proteomic profiles and pathways in the brain tissues include functional changes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, mitochondrial function, metabolism, and behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

              <p id="P28">The results show increased 4-HNE staining indicative of oxidative damage to the brain after spaceflight compared to GC controls.

              <p id="P29">Several lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is an important mediator in the bodyâ€™s response to spaceflight conditions, such as the change in the gravity vector.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Studies have shown that both simulated microgravity and spaceflight are associated with increased markers of lipid peroxidation in the brain of both humans and rodents,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and these effects were more pronounced after long-duration spaceflight.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Fluid shifts due to the elimination of gravitational gradients in microgravity result in altered cerebral circulation followed by oxidative stress.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Although, the consequences of oxidative stress in the CNS due to spaceflight are not exactly known, acute and chronic oxidative stress in ground-based scenarios have been shown responsible for the development and progression of cerebrovascular injury.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P30">Because AQP4 is highly expressed in the perivascular astrocyte end-feet surrounding the BBB,<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> astrocytic interactions with vascular capillaries were investigated using AQP4 labeling. The astrocytic end-feet occupy a larger surface area of the microvasculature than the neural processes.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Astrocyte end-feet wrap around capillary endothelial cells and regulate brain water transport through the expression of AQP4.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> AQP4 is prevalent in astrocytic membranes at the blood-brain interface and plays a role in a number of pathophysiological processes.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Furthermore, there are reports of cross-talk between astrocyte activation, AQP expression, and brain inflammation in response to injury.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Increased AQP4 expression has been demonstrated to coincide with perivascular astrocyte swelling.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Additionally, oxidative stress triggers the upregulation of AQP4 and disturbance of BBB integrity and edema formation.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> These observations are consistent with our findings that spaceflight concomitantly enhanced the expression of AQP4 and 4-HNE oxidative biomarkers.

              <p id="P31">In the present study, we also observed increased perivascular reactive GFAP astrocytes in the hippocampus of FLT mice, which indicated proliferation and hypertrophy of reactive astrocytes, a process called gliosis in response to damage to the brain.<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Activated astrocytes have been shown to secrete chemokines, pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are known to damage the endothelium and cause disruption of the BBB.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Increases in the numbers of astrocytes with neuro-inflammation are also evident in response to oxidative stress due to fractionated radiation.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> However, one previous study showed that exposure to microgravity for 14 days reduced the GFAP expression in rat hippocampal astrocytes.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> The duration of the flight, re-adaptation period and animal species may have an impact on astrocyte response. Nevertheless, findings from the present study and others indicate that spaceflight conditions disrupt normal astrocytic homeostasis and function.

              <p id="P36">Of all the proteins altered by spaceflight, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPÎ±) was significantly upregulated in the FLT group by 3.6-fold compared to GC. This protein is involved in the negative regulation of adhesion of cerebellar neurons, neurite outgrowth, and glial cell attachment.<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> It also plays a key role in intracellular signaling during synaptogenesis and in synaptic function,<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> and acts as an important inhibitory receptor that regulates a number of leukocyte functions including regulation of neutrophil migration across epithelial monolayers and monocyte migration across the BBB.<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> The upregulation of this protein observed in this study may indicate the possible development and progression of neuroinflammatory disease.</p>
              <p id="P37">Evidence indicates that oxidative stress closely links to mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in cellular homeostasis and damage, the result of which is known to lead to various neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> Many of the mitochondrial proteins that are involved in oxidative stress response were upregulated or downregulated in the brain following spaceflight (eg, ACAD9, COA5, DNM1L, FDXR, NDUFAF5, NDUFV2, OPA1, PNPLA8, SCO1, SURF1, and TXN2). Cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 1 (SURF1) is a protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and thought to be involved in the biogenesis of the cytochrome c oxidase complex. The level of SURF1 protein expression showed a threefold decrease in FLT mice over GC. Low level expresion of SURF1- mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain may have effects on brain glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow, and memory.<sup><xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref></sup></p>
              <p id="P38">Brain regional differences in stress response were also evident with spaceflight. FLT mice elicited statistically significant changes in BBB integrity biomarkers including AQP4, GFAP, and PECAM-1 in the hippocampus, but the impact was less substantial in the cortex. Previous studies have shown brain region-specific differences in response to various stressors.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></sup> The hippocampus is the most vulnerable brain region under stress or other pathological conditions.<sup><xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref></sup> The cellular components and structure of the cortex and hippocampus are notably different in terms of number and types of neurons, glia cell density, vascular density and topology, as well as metabolic activity. A previous study documented 13 days of exposure to a space environment caused modification of many proteins in the brain gray and white matter with minimum overlap of altered proteins between the two regions.<sup><xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref></sup> These structural and cellular component differences may contribute to variations in tissue damage responses. In the current study, while IHC was performed in the cortex and hippocampus, the cortical region could not be separated from the hippocampus before proteomic analysis due to logistic limitations of postflight tissue processing for these RR-9 studies. Protein expression profiles in specific regions of the brain in response to spaceflight should, therefore, be a priority in future studies.</p>
              <p id="P39">Finally, evidence in the present study of spaceflight-induced disruption of BBB integrity and proteomic alterations of signaling pathways associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction could have adverse effects beyond that of promoting possible neurodegenerative processes in the brain. For example, investigators have used whole-body mathematical modeling to examine the possible effects of impaired BBB function during spaceflight.<sup><xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> Modeling simulations predicted that reductions in the integrity of the BBB would significantly elevate intracranial pressure,<sup><xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref></sup> and correspondingly, elevations in intracranial pressure have been hypothesized to be related to impairments in visual acuity among astronauts returning from missions to the ISS.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref></sup> Therefore, if spaceflight-associated disruption of the BBB likewise occurs in humans, this could have significant adverse effects on both visual acuity and cognitive function of returning astronauts from long-duration missions.</p>
              <p id="P40">In summary, this study demonstrated acute changes in markers of oxidative stress and BBB integrity that include altered expression of BBB properties and deceased expression of intercellular junction proteins in the mouse brain within 48 hours after return from spaceflight. Our findings may provide insight into cellular mechanisms that underlie the effects of oxidative stress-mediated structure and functional damage induced by spaceflight conditions. Such studies may point toward new therapeutic avenues for cerebrovascular dysfunction and degenerative diseases by targeting oxidative stress activity and its effects on neurovascular remodeling. In addition, changes in protein expression profiles of mitochondrial function, neuronal structure, neurovascular remodeling, behavior, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism in response to spaceflight conditions warrants further investigation. Due to animal number constraints, only male mice were used in this study. Future spaceflight investigation should be conducted to evaluate the progression and long-term effects of brain cellular and functional response following spaceflight that may lead to late neurodegeneration in both male and female animals.</p>
