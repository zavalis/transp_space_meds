          <body>
            <p>Decreased mobility due to vestibular and sensorimotor alterations associated with space
flight has been identified by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s
(NASA’s) Human Research Program as a potential risk for human Mars missions.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> This risk is the greatest during and
immediately after transitions between different gravitational environments, when
decrements in locomotion and spatial orientation might have high operational impact,
such as emergency egress of the vehicle immediately after landing on a planetary
surface.</p>
            <p>Postural deficits and sensorimotor performance decrements have been observed in
astronauts after they return from short- and long-duration missions.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr7-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Results of these studies showed
decrements in postural stability and increased time required for postural recovery, both
of which intensified as a function of flight duration.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> However, previous investigations did
not include testing during the first few hours after return from long-duration missions
onboard the <italic>International Space Station</italic> (<italic>ISS</italic>); the
first postflight testing was conducted 1 day after landing, when performance decrements
had abated.</p>
            <p>Symptoms of vestibular disorders have been observed in astronauts immediately after
return from short-duration missions onboard the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> flights.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> These symptoms were recorded during medical debriefs between the astronauts and
crew flight surgeons on the day of return (generally 2-4 hours after landing) and 3 days
later. The severity of symptoms had considerably diminished 3 days after landing.
Unfortunately, similar reports are not available for the immediate postlanding period of
the <italic>Soyuz</italic> vehicle, which returns crewmembers from long-duration space
missions on the <italic>ISS</italic>.</p>
            <p>Here we report symptoms of vestibular disorders and associated sensorimotor alterations
measured in astronauts 1 to 5 hours after they return from short-duration <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> missions or long-duration <italic>ISS</italic> missions. The
scientific objective of this study was to assess the effects of mission length on
symptoms of vestibular disorders, especially instability of posture and gait. The
operational objective was to determine whether the severity of the symptoms would impair
the crews’ ability to quickly exit the vehicle in the event of an emergency.</p>

                <p>The <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> crewmembers included 12 men and 2 women (mean
± SD age, 42.4 ± 5.0 years) who flew on 3 missions that lasted about 1 week
(mean duration, 7.4 ± 0.9 days). Four crewmembers were participating in their
first space mission, and the remaining 10 had flown on at least 1 other
occasion.</p>
                <p>The <italic>ISS</italic> crewmembers included 16 men and 2 women (mean age, 45.5

<italic>Soyuz</italic> missions for missions that lasted about 6 months
(mean duration, 175.8 ± 13.7 days). Seven crewmembers were participating in
their first space missions, and 11 had flown on at least 1 other occasion.</p>
                <p>Informed written consent was obtained from all the subjects. The study was

approval was obtained from NASA’s Institutional Review Board.</p>

                <p>After a <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> mission, crewmembers were tested onboard
the crew transport vehicle at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2473974X17738767"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This mobile clinic typically docked with the <italic>Space

<italic>Space Shuttle</italic>, with assistance if needed, via a short ramp
to the crew transport vehicle, where they removed their reentry spacesuits and
were examined and treated as necessary. The time of exit from the <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> varied considerably but typically ranged from 30 to 45
minutes after landing. All subjects in the present study were examined within 1

assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2473974X17738767"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). After all the medical checks were performed, crewmembers were then
flown by helicopter to the Karaganda airport. Ten <italic>ISS</italic>
crewmembers in the present study were examined in the tent 1 to 2 hours after
landing, and 6 other <italic>ISS</italic> crewmembers were examined in the

                <p>Because the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> and <italic>ISS</italic> crewmembers’
postlanding examinations were performed several years apart, the personnel and
procedures differed. Nevertheless, the vestibular and motor function tests used
for the present study were comparable, as described in <xref rid="table2-2473974X17738767" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. However, there were some notable differences among the testing
protocols. Because of time constraints, saccades and pursuit were not examined
in the <italic>ISS</italic> subjects, and pointing tests were performed after
only 3 <italic>ISS</italic> expeditions (missions 5-7). Unlike the <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> subjects, the <italic>ISS</italic> subjects were not asked
to keep their hands crossed in front of the body during the chair stand test and
the postural stability test. In addition, when standing upright, the
<italic>ISS</italic> subjects could place their feet at a comfortable
position, typically equal to their shoulder width, whereas the <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> subjects were asked to stand upright with their feet
together. These conditions were imposed on the <italic>ISS</italic> crew for
safety reasons; the sudden transition from a prone position to a standing
position just before the testing could cause dizziness and/or faintness due to
orthostatic intolerance, so a wide stance was accepted to make the stand tests
less challenging. However, the floor of the medical tent was not as flat as that
of the crew transport vehicle, and this made the balance and gait tests more
challenging for the <italic>ISS</italic> subjects.</p>

pallor, cold sweating, nausea, and vomiting. To mitigate the symptoms, 9
crewmembers who had a history of reentry motion sickness took an oral dose (25
mg) of meclizine or promethazine after the deorbit burn (ie, 2-3 hours before

                <p>All subjects reported feeling unstable or unbalanced when walking, particularly
when making turns. Four <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> subjects had headaches
after landing, and 3 subjects reported having had headaches during the first 2
or 3 days of flight. Postflight headache in 1 of these individuals was related
to position (worse when upright, relieved upon lying supine). Only 1
<italic>ISS</italic> crewmember reported headache after landing.</p>
                <p>All 16 <italic>ISS</italic> subjects reported being nauseated immediately after
landing. In addition to these 16 subjects, 2 other crewmembers could not be
tested in the tent or at the airport because of severe reentry motion sickness
symptoms. Interestingly, none of the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> crewmembers
had symptoms of reentry motion sickness after landing. However, 7 <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> subjects reported being nauseated, an indicator of space
motion sickness, during the first few days of flight. Unfortunately, in-flight
reports of symptoms were not available for <italic>ISS</italic> crewmembers.</p>
                <p>Fifty percent of <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> subjects and 75% of
<italic>ISS</italic> subjects perceived motion of the environment or their
body when they moved their head. Translational movements along the fore-aft,
lateral, or vertical axis produced a sense of accentuated motion in that
direction. One subject bent forward to counteract the sensation of falling in
that direction and needed to straighten up abruptly to avoid falling. While
<italic>Space Shuttle</italic> subjects stooped during postflight testing,
they felt that the floor was “rushing up to meet them,” a symptom that has been
reported previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> This sensation ceased immediately when body or head motion
stopped.</p>
                <p>Other symptoms described by <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> crewmembers included
foot tingling when pressure was applied to the soles of the feet during reentry
but not when walking after landing. Skin sensitivity changes have been reported
in several other short-duration missions.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although <italic>ISS</italic> subjects did not report a tingling
sensation in their feet, they all reported that their head and limbs felt very
heavy after landing. None of the subjects reported diplopia, or double
vision.</p>

              <title>Discussion</title>
              <p>The primary purpose of this study was to assess symptoms that might impede an
astronaut’s ability to exit the vehicle unassisted after landing. Many of the
subjects in this study demonstrated vestibular abnormalities that could limit this
ability during the first 5 hours of landing.</p>
              <p>Although the time required to leave the spacecraft unassisted after landing has not
been systematically measured, for obvious safety constraints, there has been casual
observations by the crews. For example, during return of <italic>Expedition
6</italic> from the <italic>ISS</italic>, a technical malfunction caused the
<italic>Soyuz</italic> spacecraft to land some 460 km away from its planned
touchdown point. The 5-hour delay for arrival of the ground support team gave the
crew an opportunity to open the hatch, unstrap, and egress the
<italic>Soyuz</italic> spacecraft without any outside help. Performing fast,
coordinated movements was not possible, and head movement provoked oscillopsia and nausea.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p>
              <p>The present study shows that the percentage of crewmembers with symptoms of
vestibular disorders was similar after long-duration <italic>ISS</italic> missions
and short-duration <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> missions, with the exception of
reentry motion sickness. Russian investigators previously reported that motion
sickness during reentry affects 27% of the cosmonauts after short-duration missions
(4-14 days) and 92% after longer-duration missions (several months to 1
year).<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Our observations following <italic>ISS</italic> missions
support these earlier reports.</p>
              <p>The percentage of <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> subjects who had symptoms of
vestibular disorders in the present study is similar to that reported for studies of
112 astronauts who flew on the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> between 1996 and
2000.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In these previous studies, the most frequent symptoms of
vestibular disorders were persisting sensation aftereffects (60%), difficulty
walking in a straight line (57%), unstable balance (48%), imprecise finger-to-nose
pointing (20%), and use of arms for rising from a chair (14%).</p>
              <p>Postflight sensory feedback, postural equilibrium, and motor performance have
important implications for the success of potential emergency egress from the space
vehicle immediately after landing. Our results indicate that <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> and <italic>ISS</italic> subjects would both have serious
difficulties egressing a spacecraft without assistance soon after landing in case of
an emergency. A previous report estimated that 5% to 15% of <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> crewmembers would be unable to egress the <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> due to neurovestibular symptoms and orthostatic intolerance
after landing.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Since <italic>ISS</italic> crewmembers have a greater incidence of
reentry-induced motion sickness, this might exacerbate performance of an emergency
egress after long-duration missions.</p>
              <p>We expected, however, that the proportion of subjects who failed the standing and
balance tests would be higher after <italic>ISS</italic> than <italic>Space
Shuttle</italic> missions, as shown by the results of computerized dynamic
posturography,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr19-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> but this was not the case in our study. Our results might be
affected by the different testing conditions for the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic>
and <italic>ISS</italic> subjects. Indeed, the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic>
subjects performed tests with their feet together and their arms across the chest,
whereas the <italic>ISS</italic> subjects had their feet apart and their arms
aligned with their body. Also, the degree of impairment after landing probably
reflects factors other than mission duration, such as previous flight experience,
in-flight exercise, and the use of other procedures intended to preserve orthostatic
function upon return to Earth. For example, the conditions of reentry for the
<italic>Space Shuttle</italic> and the <italic>Soyuz</italic> capsule are
different. The decelerating gravitoinertial force in <italic>Soyuz</italic> is about
4 Gx (directed along the subject’s chest to back), as opposed to 1.2 Gz in the
<italic>Space Shuttle</italic> (directed along the subject’s head to toe).
<italic>Space Shuttle</italic> crews were required to wear a specialized suit
weighting about 32 kg; thus, leaving the vehicle, even under nominal conditions, was
physically strenuous. Finally, the <italic>Space Shuttle</italic> floor was nearly
horizontal after landing (except for a 6-degree forward pitch attitude), whereas the
<italic>Soyuz</italic> capsule could land upright on its side and the terrain
might not be flat.</p>
              <p>Another limitation of this study is that postflight vestibular examinations were
performed in some subjects who took meclizine or promethazine. These vestibular
suppressants can impair vestibular perception and cause drowsiness,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> affecting the results of the vestibular examination and limiting the
applicability of assessing symptoms that might impede an astronaut’s ability to exit
the vehicle unassisted after landing.</p>

                <title>Vestibular Abnormalities after Space Flight</title>
                <p>The 2 most frequent findings in this study were postural instability and reports
of illusory sensations that the self or the environment was moving during rapid
movements of the head or torso. Postural abnormalities during the immediate
postlanding period have been documented<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and are generally believed
to reflect disturbances in vestibular or proprioceptive function. Numerous
anecdotal reports of perceived motion associated with head movements have been
noted as well (reviewed by Reschke et al<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>). These illusory movement sensations, particularly oscillopsia, are
usually attributed to disturbances in vestibular or cerebellar function<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and may well have a different etiology from the postural
disturbances.</p>
                <p>The vestibular system unquestionably plays an important role in postural and
locomotor control. Acute injuries to the vestibular system produce imbalance and
vertigo, after which subjects (animals, humans with labyrinthine defects)
accommodate and regain the ability to walk.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The action of antigravity muscles depends on vestibular system activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Impairments in the ability to identify the direction of discrete whole
body linear movements after returning from space could indicate that otolith
function may be less sensitive after a space flight than before.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p>
                <p>It has been proposed that vestibular, proprioceptive, and visual inputs, which
are critical for equilibrium and gait, are redundant (ie, that only 1 is
sufficient under normal conditions).<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Many patients with bilateral vestibular loss do not have normal gait and
fall frequently.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> However, some patients with labyrinthine defects learn to
walk without difficulty, despite visual blurring with sudden head movements.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> These individuals also have little difficulty maintaining balance with
their eyes closed and their feet together,<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> suggesting that they are mainly using proprioceptive inputs for balance.
In addition, individuals with severe sensory neuropathy cannot maintain their
balance in the dark or with their eyes closed, despite having normal vestibular
systems. Postural instability can be evoked in those without sensory defects by
several methods: extending the subject’s neck so that visual fixation is
impossible and the otoliths are out of their normal plane of function, occluding
or perturbing visual stimuli, or minimizing foot proprioception by having the
subject stand on a thick surface.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Bed rest and dry immersion both produce postural instability that
persists for roughly the same period as the postural instability noted after
space flight,<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> which implies that proprioception is a likely factor in producing this
instability.</p>
                <p>Illusory motion sensation has long been thought to depend on an intact vestibular
system. Mach<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> demonstrated that sudden acceleration or deceleration produced sensations
of movement in the direction opposite that of the acceleration. Illusory motion
sensation can be produced through other means, such as visual stimuli or
vibrating peripheral muscle spindles.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Space crewmembers
returning to Earth have reported that moving their head in pitch or roll can
cause the sensation of an exaggerated translational motion in direction to the
head movement. This phenomenon has occurred during reentry and occasionally
shortly after landing, and it has been attributed to a reinterpretation of the
otolith signals.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr35-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> On Earth, otolith signals may be interpreted as linear
motion or head tilt relative to gravity. Because stimulation from gravity is
absent during spaceflight, interpretation of the graviceptors as tilt is
inappropriate. Therefore, during adaptation to weightlessness and shortly after
return to Earth, the brain would interpret all otolith graviceptor inputs to
indicate translation.</p>
                <p>Postflight disturbances in balance and walking control could be due in part to
changes in how the central nervous system processes sensory information as a
result of prolonged exposure to weightlessness.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Investigators have proposed a training program for facilitating recovery
of balance and locomotor function after long-duration space flight. Manipulating
the sensory conditions during exercise (eg, varying visual flow patterns during
walking on a treadmill while watching a moving screen) will systematically and
repeatedly promote adaptive change in walking performance and improve the
astronaut’s ability to adapt to a novel gravity environment. It is anticipated
that this training regimen will facilitate neural adaptation to unit gravity
(Earth) and partial gravity (Mars) after long-duration space flight.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup></p>

                <title>Impact for Clinical Research</title>
                <p>Balance disorders and illusory motion sensations develop in healthy individuals
as a result of exposure to microgravity and subsequent reexposure to normal
gravity. Space research provides an invaluable opportunity to understand the
evolutionary physiology of humans. From a neurologic perspective, the unique
aspects of the space flight environment are particularly important for
elucidating the mechanisms of spatial orientation, posture, and locomotion.</p>
                <p>As people age on Earth, they sometimes experience instabilities when standing and
walking. The development of simple walking and balance training procedures like
the ones used by the astronauts in orbit can be used to help prevent falling and
injury in the elderly population.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2473974X17738767" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Also, the abbreviated vestibular examination designed for use aboard the
crew transport vehicle and in the medical tent can be used to remotely evaluate
elderly or patients with vestibular disorders. Because smartphones have
introduced an easy method to record video, patients could record themselves
performing stand tests and tandem walking tests at regular intervals in their
homes, and otolaryngologists or neurologists could remotely evaluate their
recovery.</p>
